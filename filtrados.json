["- Today we're making one of\nmy all time favorite cakes,", "German chocolate cake,", "named after Samuel\nGerman, not the country.", "It is the most tender, amazing\nlike delicate chocolate cake,", "it just melts in your mouth,", "but it's sandwiched between\nthese insanely delicious layers", "of like a caramel toasted\npecan coconut frosting", "that is just beyond the beyond.", "Let's get started.", "First off, we're gonna prep our pans.", "This is a very tender,\ndelicate, delicious cake,", "but it can fall apart\nwhen it's plopping out", "especially since it's\na big eight inch pan.", "You are gonna wanna use a\nround of parchment paper", "and just make your own.", "Put that pan down, trace around,", "fold your paper in half,", "and you're gonna cut\njust inside of your line.", "One you don't want pencil\nthat you're eating,", "and two it's gonna fit comfortably", "inside the pan with no wrinkling.", "There we go, it does\nnot have to be perfect,", "no one's gonna notice", "it's really just gonna\nkeep your cake together", "when it plops out of the pan.", "You can use butter and flour", "or today you can take a\nshortcut and use baking spray.", "This stuff is hilarious by the way,", "it's like a generic brand I think", "but it's pure oil in here and it says,", "zero fat, zero calories, blah blah blah,", "because the serving size is\na third of a second burst.", "This is the serving size.", "Actually, that was like half a second.", "So, be careful when you read labels,", "like my little hint for you today.", "All right, spray the inside of the pan,", "especially the sides,", "put that parchment paper on there,", "press down, a little bit more spray.", "Just repeat that process\nuntil you're all done.", "If you're buttering\nand flouring your pans,", "really just flour the sides really well,", "a little bit of butter to\nhold parchment paper down", "and then some more butter on top.", "(upbeat music)", "(coughing)", "It's like coal miner's\nlung but with baking spray.", "Okay, there we go.", "Those are all ready.", "And now we can make that batter.", "First off, we're gonna get\nthat dry ingredient combo", "into our large bowl.", "For the dry ingredients", "I'm starting off with 2 1/4\ncups of all purpose flour", "and that is a about 270 grams", "if you're measuring up like I am.", "200 and.", "yeah 270 grams.", "1/2 teaspoon of salt,", "one teaspoon of baking soda,", "1/4 teaspoon of baking powder, in you go,", "and I'm adding in one\ntablespoon of cocoa powder.", "This is optional,", "I like a little bit more\nchocolate in my cake", "but a German chocolate cake", "is actually a very light chocolate", "almost like a red velvet\ncake, very light chocolate", "from that sweet Baker's German chocolate.", "All right, one tablespoon in you go.", "Sift it up.", "Oh, those lumps,", "but okay.", "Now whisk it up.", "Once everything is combined,", "set it aside and it's on to the chocolate.", "(upbeat music)", "Nearly all the chocolate\nflavor from this cake", "is coming from German's sweet chocolate.", "Not sponsored but a German chocolate cake", "is literally just a chocolate\ncake made I think in the 1800s", "to promote this type of chocolate", "from Baker's chocolate\ncompany made by Samuel German.", "So that's why it's called\na German chocolate cake.", "I actually get a lot of\ncomments from people saying,", "this isn't a German cake,", "why are you calling it\nGerman chocolate cake,", "there's no such thing,", "but the guy's name was\nGerman, there you go.", "Four ounces, we're gonna\nchop it up really finely", "because I'm gonna melt it", "with some nice hot coffee, half a cup.", "Chop, chop, chop, chop.", "This chocolate is really\ndelicious by the way,", "I've been nibbling on it.", "It's like a sweet dark\nchocolate, really nice.", "(upbeat music)", "Okay, once your chocolate\nis all chopped up,", "plop it into like a medium bowl carefully,", "this is a little awkward.", "And now half a cup of a hot, hot coffee.", "The goal is to not have to use", "a double boiler or the microwave", "and then pour that on top,", "clean the counter up and set it aside.", "After it's sat for like\nmaybe 30 seconds or so", "we can whisk it up, see\nwhat's gonna happen.", "This chocolate actually", "has like a little bit of a coconut flavor,", "I don't know if it's just me conditioned", "to like expect that frosting\nbut it's really interesting,", "it's a nice flavor.", "I'm surprised", "because it's not like a fancy\nEuropean chocolate company,", "it's like Baker's chocolate\nthat you get in the supermarket.", "Okay, that's nice.", "Couple lumps are leftover,\nthey're gonna melt", "and if they don't, I could\npop this in the microwave", "for 30 seconds and then\nit'll fix everything.", "But for now, we can set this aside", "and get on to the other\nparts of the batter.", "I'm adding 1 1/4 cups of\nunsalted room temperature butter", "into my stand mixer fitted\nwith a whisk attachment.", "We're gonna cream it up\nand then add our sugar in", "so let's get it nice and creamy first.", "(upbeat music)", "(mixer whirring)", "That butter looks great to me.", "So I have two cups of sugar here", "but I'm reserving one\n1/4 of a cup for later.", "So, separate that out and\nlet's drizzle the sugar in", "until we have a nice fluffy mixture.", "(upbeat music)", "This looks nice, light and fluffy to me,", "let's scrape it down and then\nmove on to the next step.", "So what I'm gonna do is\nseparate my eggs on the fly.", "This will be for the whites.", "The yolks will go straight in there", "one at a time while the mixer is running", "and we're gonna do it gracefully", "and nothing wrong is gonna happen here,", "There will be no yolks and my whites,", "no shells either, hello.", "Already had a broken yoke,\nthis isn't voting well, boo.", "(mixer whirring)", "Egg number two,", "in you go.", "Number three.", "Four.", "I'm gonna add 1 1/2 teaspoons\nof vanilla in right now,", "it's about 1/2 a tablespoon.", "Scrape that bowl down,\nthis looks delicious to me.", "Just checking back with my\nchocolate ganache mixture", "it's a very thin ganache,", "looks like everything melted together.", "It smells, it smells so good, my gosh.", "What is this magical chocolate?", "I'm gonna pour this in while\nthe mixer is running and.", "(mixer whirring)", "Well.", "All right, let me scrape the\ntop down since that was crazy.", "I knew I shouldn't have done that", "but I put it at high anyways.", "That's called self sabotage.", "Now, we can get that, you can see", "there's a lot of unmixed\nstuff you're hanging around.", "Okay, now let's give it one more mix", "just to make sure\neverything's all together", "and then we'll start adding\nour dry mixture in as well.", "(mixer whirring)", "All right, so this is\none of those situations", "where you're gonna add in", "a little bit of the dry\na little bit of the wet,", "a little bit of the dry,\na little bit of the wet,", "rest of the dry and you're done.", "So, mix it back and forth,", "roughly in thirds I guess,\nthirds and halves on low.", "(mixer whirring)", "Don't spill.", "One cup of buttermilk by the way.", "A little bit more flour,", "the rest of the buttermilk.", "Me, don't spill, buttermilk, spills.", "All right, last bit of flour, in you go.", "Use your spatula and just you know,", "see what's happening inside of that bowl.", "There's gonna be some flour up on top,", "maybe some unmixed parts on the bottom,", "but don't worry about it", "because right now it's time\ndo to those egg whites.", "Into a clean bowl with a clean whisk", "we're gonna add those egg\nwhites now, in you go.", "Whisk it up slowly", "then increase the speed\nas they get frothy.", "(mixer whirring)", "All right, and as those eggs froth up,", "we can drizzle our quarter\ncup of reserved sugar in.", "(upbeat music)", "And we're gonna take this\nto the soft peak stage.", "All right, let's take a look.", "Whoa, very nice.", "That is a very perky peak but\nI'm still calling it soft.", "(upbeat music)", "Almost done.", "Now it's time to take", "some of this beautiful\nfluffy egg white mixture,", "I'm gonna take maybe a cup of it,", "and just mix it in really fast\nto lighten this batter a bit", "and then we're gonna fold the rest in.", "This batter is so dreamy,", "oh my gosh, I would eat this raw.", "And by would I mean I have several times.", "Okay, that's good.", "Now, take all those egg whites out.", "And it's time to fold.", "When we fold, go down,", "through the bottom, and\nthen cut into the middle.", "So down, into the middle,\ndown, cut into the middle.", "You can move the bowl around a bit,", "but the idea is you're not crushing all", "those little egg white bubbles.", "Many of them are getting crushed,", "but, you know, like\nthose baby sea turtles,", "some of them are gonna make it.", "(upbeat music)", "Okay, and after a little\nbit of careful folding,", "we end up with this, this like amazing", "light, fluffy chocolate\nbatter, it is so heavenly.", "There we go.", "I am fully satisfied with the\nconsistency of this batter", "and now it is gonna be\ntime to divide it evenly.", "I will be using a scale though", "because it's hard to\ntell with this batter,", "it's not really liquidy", "so to be a mound, you have\nto shake it around, so.", "So I think it's probably gonna be about", "maybe 400 and change grams each.", "Let's see, that's 450", "\u266a Baby \u266a", "\u266a Baby \u266a", "\u266a Baby \u266a", "Okay more, it's more than 450,", "probably about 500.", "\u266a Baby baby baby \u266a", "Okay, yeah it's about\n500 and change per pan.", "If you're measuring it out", "just make sure you zero out your scale", "before you put the batter\nin but after the pan's on.", "So you can see all I'm going to do", "is just kind of tap it around a bit", "just so it spreads out a little bit", "before I put it into the oven.", "It's not the end of the world\nthough, it'll self level.", "I'm adding some baking strips on", "to get a nice flat cake layer.", "If you wanna learn more\nabout baking strips,", "click over there for my how\nto get flat cake layers video,", "it is my most popular video ever", "because people love\nflat cakes for stacking,", "so much easier when they're not domed.", "Although it cuts down on the snacking", "for all those all those cake\ndams you're gonna cut off.", "All right, into the oven,\n350 for about half an hour.", "You might wanna try moving the pans around", "if your oven has a hot spot,", "but try and let them sit in the\noven without disturbing them", "because this is like a\nsouffle like consistency", "this taste like chocolate\nmousse raw, so good,", "right into the oven.", "Let's make this happen.", "Into like a medium saucepan,", "I'm adding in 1 1/4 cups of\npacked light brown sugar.", "I have a quarter teaspoon of salt,", "you could be a little generous", "if you want to add a bit more.", "1 1/2 sticks of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature.", "Why unsalted butter?", "Because different butter makers", "have different amounts of\nsalt in their salted butter", "so we wanna control the salt, in you go.", "One can of evaporated milk", "and that is 12 fluid\nounces or 354 milliliters.", "All right, and then the last\nthing is three egg yolks.", "So, reserve those whites,\nuse them for something later.", "You can make a healthy egg white omelet", "which is disgusting to atone for your sins", "after eating all this cake.", "(upbeat music)", "Two yolks,", "and three yolks, there we go.", "Wash your hands.", "I'm gonna mix this up a bit,", "I'm gonna use a French whisk for this.", "French whisks are narrower", "and not as bulbous as a\nregular balloon whisk.", "That's nice because it can\nget the corners of your pot", "and nothing's gonna get burnt in there,", "everything will be whipped up.", "Mix it up a little bit then put it on heat", "and don't forget that splash of vanilla.", "It's one teaspoon.", "That's a teaspoon.", "All right, onto the heat.", "I have set this clumpy, lumpy\nmixture over medium heat.", "Go ahead and just start stirring it", "that butter will melt up,", "everything's gonna be okay", "and this is gonna smell so amazing,", "it's gonna be like a candy facial.", "Okay, by the by you could have\nused melted butter in here", "and it would have been so easy.", "And why didn't I think of this?", "I'm changing on the recipe\ncard, use melted butter.", "There we go.", "It's melting up, just\nstir it continuously.", "In about five minutes", "you're gonna have a very thick\nmixture coming to a boil.", "Give those pecans a rough chop,", "they don't need to be fine,\nyou can have big pieces.", "It's all about that texture.", "All right, I think we're done", "so I'm gonna take it off the heat", "and add this other ingredients in.", "Transfer this into a bowl so\nit cools down a bit faster,", "this copper pot is very hot.", "Right now I'm gonna add my\ntoasted pecans in there.", "What, so fragrant and last but not least", "this sweetened shredded coconut,\nit's Angel Flake coconut,", "and my mum used to keep\nthis in the freezer", "and my brother and I", "would sneak a handful\nevery day in the afternoon,", "we'd like take a little bit\nuntil there was none left.", "And my mum would be like,", "I'm making a German chocolate\ncake, where's all my coconut?", "It's in our bellies.", "All right, now just mix it\nup to combine everything", "and try not to snack too\nmuch, it's still pretty hot.", "This stuff, this stuff is the business.", "That is so good.", "If you haven't had German chocolate cake,", "where have you been?", "Where have you been?", "Eat this, make it, eat it.", "Set this aside until it is cool enough", "to spread onto your cooled cake layers", "that are still in the oven,", "and you'll have a delicious amazing treat.", "This cake is so tender", "but there's a trade off, it's delicate.", "And as that cake cools down,", "all those air bubbles\nwill shrink a little bit", "as the air condenses, less kinetic energy,", "blah, blah, blah, things\nyou don't care about,", "and you know it's gonna\ncollapse a little bit", "but it is still the most amazing cake.", "It's not all chemicals,", "there's a lot of you know\nfrom sodium bicarbonate,", "there is a lot of those egg\nwhites having fluffed it up", "so a little shrinkage is\nokay, don't worry about it.", "I'm gonna gently invert it\nonto a wire cooling rack.", "All these things I\ndon't normally do, okay.", "And here we go.", "And then just take the\nparchment off immediately", "because it's changing the rate", "at which the bottom shrinks\ndown but that's very nice, look.", "This cake, this cake I tell you.", "(soft music)", "Lift it up,", "get that parchment paper off quickly", "because it's gonna change the rate", "at which the bottom shrinks", "and you don't want your cake layers", "to be all you know,", "trapezoidal with our cross section,", "you want nice cylindrical prisms.", "Let these cool completely\nbefore you assemble,", "trust me the wait will be worth it.", "This cake is gonna be so fun to assemble.", "All I have to do is get\nan ice cream scooper", "and scoop on a thick layer\nof that insane frosting.", "Scoop it on or just like\nplop it on with a spoon", "if you don't have an ice cream scooper", "and then give it a quick smooth,", "don't be too careful about it though.", "Add on the next layer, repeat the process", "and then add a final\ngiant as thick as possible", "layer of the frosting on top.", "You can give it a nice,\nlike a gentle smooth,", "don't try and make it look too perfect", "because this is a rustic\nlooking delicious cake.", "So just smooth it out a little bit", "and then it's ready to eat.", "You can store this at room temperature", "if it's like covered under\na cake dome overnight", "or refrigerate it,", "bring it back to room temperature", "and eat the entire thing.", "I am so ready for this piece.", "I love this cake.", "Just let me get
