use a\nhigher grade of chocolate,", "we certainly do sometimes,", "you just have to temper it", "and tempering just means bringing it up", "to a certain temperature\nletting it cool down,", "and then you get to use it again.", "The main reason why I decided\nto use Almond Bark today", "is just because you don't\nhave to go through all that.", "It still tastes really nice.", "You can get it in white chocolate.", "You can get it in regular chocolate.", "Today, we're going to be\nusing regular chocolate", "and I've just cut it up into chunks.", "I put it in this Pyrex glass\nbowl, put it in

or three minutes.", "And then you end up with this lovely", "just fabulous bowl of melted chocolate.", "So let's go ahead and get started.", "I have got my melted chocolate\nand I've got a tablespoon.", "So as hot cocoa bombs\nhave become more popular,", "lots more ways to do this.", "And you certainly may have, you know,", "your own way of what you're\nmore comfortable with.", "That is perfectly fine.", "What I have found, however,\nis that here in the bakery,", "we have several sets of measuring spoons", "and I use some for some\nthings and some for others,", "but this measuring spoon,", "we're going to be using\na tablespoon today,", "and this one is a cup.", "I mean, it really is, it's not\na flat, it's more of a cup.", "And what I've found is\nthat it's more similar", "to the actual cup,", "I don't know if you can\nsee that, of the mold.", "So it works really well.", "And so with our melted chocolate", "I'm gonna move this over a little bit.", "The first thing we're going to do", "is we're going to go through", "and we're going to add one\ntablespoon of melted chocolate", "to each one of these molds.", "You don't have to worry about\ndoing anything with it yet.",

know if you guys are.", "I try to be neat in the\nkitchen, but oh my goodness,", "I'm dragging chocolate everywhere.", "So don't feel bad if you do\nthat, it's perfectly fine.", "Maybe y'all have somebody nice enough", "to clean up after you,\nwouldn't that be fabulous?", "Okay, so I've got chocolate\nin all six of my molds", "and here's what you're going to do.", "You're going to take the\nbowl part of the tablespoon,", "and you're just going to\nkind of press down in here", "and you're going to just\nsmooth that chocolate", "up on the sides.", "I don't know if you guys can see that.", "And so you're just going to go through.", "This is just the first coat.", "So we're going to do\ntwo coats of chocolate.", "I've learned the hard way.", "If you don't do two coats,", "you go to try to pop that\nthing out of the mold", "and guess what, jokes on you,", "it's not going to work out very well.", "So we're just kind of\ngently moving the chocolate", "up the side.", "And you want to make sure guys", "that you are bringing your chocolate", "all the way up to this lip.", "That's going to be the weak\nspot in your hot cocoa bomb", "so you want to make\nsure that you're

little bit differently,", "because now there is a cold surface", "that we're applying chocolate to,", "which means that you can't do six", "and then try to go back to it.", "So these, I just do one at a time.", "And so that's what we're going to do.", "So we're going to start\nwith kind of a flat scoop", "of our tablespoon.", "We're going to pour it right in the center", "and then quickly we're

even,", "then you might just put\nyour finger through it.", "And we don't want you to do that.", "We are setting you up for success.", "Perfect.", "Okay, I'm going to pop\nthis in the freezer again,",

part.", "My staff will tell you", "that this is a very satisfying process", "and they love when we're\nmaking hot cocoa bombs", "and they get to help me unmold them.", "It seems kind of nerve wracking,", "but I promise you if you do\nthe two coats of chocolate,", "if you make sure that you've got it going", "up the sides evenly", "it's going to be just\nfine, I promise you it is.", "So what you're going to do", "is you're going to take your mold.", "You're going to start at the edge", "and you're just going to kind\nof pull the silicone away.", "And as you do that, you're\ngoing to have your fingers", "underneath the cup right here.", "And you're just going\nto pop it out like that.", "It's so simple.", "I have got a few different things here", "that I'm going to move over.",

be\nintimidated by this process.", "But there's a couple of things you want", "to make sure that you have.", "One of them is, I have a ceramic plate", "and that plate has actually\nbeen heated in the microwave,", "just like this.", "So put it in the microwave,", "you're not trying to burn yourself.", "You just want this to be warm", "because this is what's going to help you", "create the seal that will hold\nyour hot cocoa bomb together.", "So I've put it in our\nmicrowave for about 45 seconds.", "Our microwave is kind of\nnuclear powered, it's crazy.", "So you might need a little bit longer.",

we're going to take one of our spheres.", "And as you can probably tell", "there's just a little rough\nedge or anything on here.", "They're not perfect yet,\nbut they're going to be,", "and we're going to take\nit and turn it upside down", "on our warm plate.", "And we're just going to start turning.", "And as we turn, the warmth of the plate", "is actually melting\nthat edge of chocolate,",

quickly.", "The biggest thing to remember", "is that you have to melt every edge, okay?", "So you can't just do the top\nand then not do the bottom.", "You have to do all of them.", "We're using a heaping\ntablespoon of ridiculously good", "hot cocoa.", "And I'm going to add that\ndirectly into the shell", "that I just made.", "I'm going to add some\nregular marshmallows.", "I'm going to add

my bottom.", "That's the last thing\nI'm going to put in here.", "Then I'm going to take my top,\nand again, I'm just turning,", "you don't have to go all\nHe-Man on it, just be gentle.", "And now we have our second edge.", "So super important, here's\nwhat we're going to do.", "We're taking that top edge\nand we're lining it up", "with our bottom edge.", "And then we're just kind\nof taking our finger", "and gently going around.", "Now, look, you've got a\nlittle bit of melted chocolate", "on your plate.", "Just use that if you need\nto, it's perfectly fine.", "And this is our sealed hot

have\nto use flaked sea salt.", "If you've never used it,", "it is a mild salt, it has\nwonderful flavor to it,", "it has a beautiful presentation,", "which is why I like to use it.", "And it's great to finish things with.", "So just gonna go back and forth.", "You can actually see the\nlittle flakes of salt", "in this caramel.", "And then I reach into my little box here,", "and we're just going to\nput a sprinkling on top.", "Isn't that pretty?", "So now we're going to move on into some", "heart-shaped hot cocoa bombs,", "and these are a little trickier,\nit's okay, you got this,", "I believe in you.", "But we're going to do the technique", "a little bit differently.", "So we've got some heart shaped molds.", "These have a little geometric\npattern on the top of them,", "which really is cool\nonce they get unmolded.", "And the first thing I'm going to do", "is I have got some luster dust.", "So because they're Valentine's Day,", "we want them to be even more special", "than

little\nextra something right now.", "So for those of you who do,\nthose are going to be for you.", "So this is just edible\nglitter, edible luster dust,", "whatever you want to call it.", "So we're going to do\nthese a little different", "and we're just going to start\nand you can see the glitter", "is coming out.", "This is going to look so cool", "once our chocolate gets on there.", "Sometimes

glitter,", "because that's what we got going on.", "All right, so for our other ones,", "we are actually going to do gold", "because I thought those\nwould be super pretty.", "So we are going to start\nwith our pastry brush.", "We are still going to be\ndoing two layers of chocolate", "in each of these shells.", "It's just, we're going to\ndo it like we're painting.", "So how fun is that?",

chocolate.", "And I'm literally just\ngoing to start painting", "and you can add, you know,", "you can be generous with\nthe amount of chocolate", "that you're putting in there.", "And when you're using this brush,", "the great thing about it is that", "you're going to be able\nto get in all these", "nooks and crannies.", "These particular heart shaped molds", "have kind of a geometric face to them,", "a geometric pattern to them.", "And because of that", "they have just all kinds of little angles.", "So you don't even have to worry so much", "about painting per se, you\nknow, with exact paint strokes,", "you literally can just dab\nthe chocolate with your brush.", "And you just want to make\nsure that you bring those up", "the sides just like you did before.", "Try not to have any bare spots.", "If you do, if you realize\nafter you've done this", "that you got some bare spots, it's fine.", "Just go back through with your brush", "and your melted chocolate\nand cover them up.",

chocolate shell", "for all the goodies that\nwe're going to put in there.", "So we are going to take these,", "we're going to pop them in the freezer,", "maybe five minutes or so,", "and then we're going to get them back.", "So I am almost done with\nthis second coat of chocolate", "and I know the edges are a\nlittle messy that's fine.", "Once we pop these out and\nwe heat those edges up", "to attach our top and\nbottom halves to each other,", "those messy edges will be all cleaned up.", "And they're ready for the freezer.", "So I have unmolded our\nhearts and they're beautiful.", "So we're going to go\nahead and start assembling", "these heart shaped\nchocolate dipped strawberry", "hot cocoa bombs for Valentine's day.", "So I've got our bottom right here.", "I've got my warm plate,

go ahead and do the next one.", "All right, so we're going\nto do the grownup version.", "So we have our bottom that\nhas our beautiful gold shimmer", "on it.", "Also going to do teaspoon of

marshmallows", "and we're going to put some sprinkles", "'cause grownups need sprinkles too.", "We're gonna do our lid", "Take our finger, go around that edge.", "And so for this ganache,\nthe recipe for that", "is you can literally just\ntake one cup of heavy cream,", "keep that in the microwave\nuntil it just starts to simmer.", "You can take about one\ncup or so of chocolate.", "And you're going to whisk\nthat into the heavy cream", "until it melts and then\nyou will add one cap", "of each of the liqueurs.", "So whatever liqueur you love,", "that's the liqueur you add.", "It doesn't have to be the ones that I did.", "I just wanted to do a chocolate\ndipped strawberry theme.", "So with these heart shapes,", "they're a little more persnickety.", "So you may have to go along your edge", "just like I'm doing, to make\nsure that they're sealed.", "Now we get to decorate them.", "All right, so this is our\nfamily-friendly hot cocoa bombs.", "You guys can see, I've got\nseveral different things,", "again, we're going to have everything", "that we want to decorate with.", "So I've got some very bright\npink melted chocolate.", "I've got conversation hearts.", "I've got more sprinkles than\nanyone on one planet needs.", "That's okay.", "So we're going to go\nahead and decorate these.", "We're going to have a\nlittle bit of fun with this.", "So you can go all the way back and forth", "like we did for the\nsphere hot cocoa bombs.", "I'm just going to do them\na little bit differently.", "So I'm going to just do one side.", "So I'm going to kind\nof start at the middle,", "isn't that pretty?", "Okay, so we've got our chocolate.", "Now we're going to take some\nof our conversation hearts,", "put those on there.", "We're going to take some of our sprinkles,",

cake.\n- Well it's heavy,", "so I'm gonna get it for you.", "(laughs)", "Okay.", "So we'll come looking at\nyou in like 40 minutes,", "35 or 40 minutes.", "We're getting closer, y'all", "but because of the extra liquid in it", "it's a little thinner, you can see that,", "that's still, I'm gonna run\nthat for about 10 more minutes", "and then we'll take another peak at it.", "But we're sure gonna\ntry not to overcook it.", "You twisting your butt, not the pan.", "- [Teresa] I know, but\nyou're supposed to talk.", "(laughs)", "There it is.\n- You're shaking", "your little hiney.", "Yeah,

what it\nshould look like, y'all", "And when it cools it'll\nstay together, I promise.", "Now how long did we wind up cooking that?", "- This was actually for 45 minutes.", "- It was.", "Because, here I'll get\nthe oven door for you.", "- Thank you.", "- Because we put it back on,", "what'd you start it at, Teresa?", "- I started it at 35.\n- 35,", "- And then we checked it.\n- then we added", "10 more minutes, so 45 minutes.", "- Which is what the recipe says.", "- Yes.", "Our lavender lemon gooey\nbutter cakes are ready", "and 45 minutes was the\nmagic number for this one.", "Now that's without knowing\nhow your oven runs,", "that would be up to you.", "But 45 minutes was perfect in mine.", "And you saw the little jiggle", "the little wiggle jiggle it did?", "And the more this

does, doesn't it?", "- [Teresa] So would you add\nmore lavender or cut out?", "- No I would say.\n- Lemon?", "- Omit.\n- Yeah, yeah.", "Or maybe do just.\n- One lemon.", "- Or just the maybe grate

gonna adjust\nthe recipe just as an FYI.", "And put just the zest in there\nand not the lemon, agreement?", "- Yeah.", "Or if you really want\nlavender, just do the lavender.", "- Just do lavender,

go.", "We're gonna get that out to\nthat, that biggest circle.", "All right y'all, I've got\nmy crust to a 10 inch,", "10 inch round circle.", "Now I'm gonna put this in my pie plate.", "And see, this is why I asked", "for you to roll it out", "because that's gonna leave us enough dough", "to turn this over", "and make a nice big crust.", "So when you cut into that pie,", "we'll have something to

indention.", "So,", "we shall see.", "It can't hurt the taste of them at all.", "They smell so good.", "So, if you wanna make these,", "and you don't have any corn starch,", "and it calls for a third
