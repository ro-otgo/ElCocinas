[Music] hi welcome to Chris cook for you too today we're going to be baking chicken now a lot of people that came to me and asked me how do you bake chicken in the oven it's really really simple and baking I'm going to be making chicken legs but baking chicken legs or chicken quarters if you use the same procedures as if people baking a whole chicken so you can take what I'm doing today and you can apply it to baking a whole chicken the only difference is I'm going to show you how to clean these chicken legs as well so let's get started with the ingredients that you're going to need in order to bake chicken you're going to need of course two chicken legs and I'm using these chicken quarters and if you're doing a whole chicken then you just need your whole chicken or whatever pieces it is that you're going to use now your seasonings can vary and you wouldn't use the same ones that I'm using or you can use the same ones that I'm using a lot of times you can get away with just using this to bake and this will make your chicken real good if you want chicken that has more flavor to it then you can get off into more seasonings here is the basic chicken seasoning that you would need when baking your chicken you would need pepper salt onion powder garlic powder and paprika now if you want to branch out into more seasonings you can and use whichever ones that you would like but to this I'm going to add poultry seasoning and I want to add adobo seasoning now this will make your baked chicken taste very very good but if you want to get off into using other seasonings if you want to use rosemary if you want to use some anything that you want to use them may be different you can use rosemary you can use a hint of sage you can use some parsley you can use anything that you like but these are just basics that I use for baking chicken so I'm going to go way meet you at the sink for showing you how to clean your chicken quarter be ready anywhere okay now I'm at the sink and there's several things really that you need to know about cleaning our chicken legs I should have just done a whole segment on just getting them clean but let me just go ahead and do just I guess a mini version of what I'm going to do first of all you have to get all this fat you see the fat that's going along the side of the chicken then you have to get that off because that's too much excess fat on the side of the chicken now there's a part here you only see a little part of it with this particular piece of chicken but that's the butt end of the chicken if you don't eat it then you can just go ahead and cut it also if you do eat it then you can leave it there sometimes you will see hairs on the chicken these are just the feathers that came from them when they clean the chicken you want to get all of those feathers off of the chicken any excess skin like this there's a lot of chicken feathers right there but any excess skin you don't really need it now if you want to eat as you can but I always take it off and then there's a part in the back and this is crucial you see that part there's a little bitty break in where that that backbone is right there so you want to clean that out just take your thumb and your thumb will slide all the way through there and you want to clean out all of that little extra book and sometimes there's extra slime on the chicken so you want to get that chicken you know all of that slime out of there as well now once you do that if this chicken is too large for your family all that excess fat that excess fat you want to get out okay and you want to throw it out now if this chicken is too big of a piece then you got children and it's too big of a piece for your children there's a way to know how to cut the you see where that fat runs dead down there that's where you cut it there's a little piece of fat try to show you on another you will always see it see that little line of fat that runs down there and this is the slam I was talking about see that's just lining you want to get it off but you see that little piece of fat that's how you know where to cut this chicken quarter if you want to make two pieces out of it now I'll show it to you I'm going to come straight down that okay now I got two pieces okay you come straight down that that part and you'll always go through that bone I'm going to do it again let's take this one see it there it is right there and I saw all of your chicken quarters come straight down see and you'll hit it every time okay try it one more time then I'm gonna leave it alone see it there it is right there come straight down because that's exactly where your bone is so you want to come straight through it now on here you see that I deviated just a little bit when I see it go in but that's exactly where you want to be cutting at now I still have to clean all of that but I just wanted to show you that now here see the back of that you don't want to eat that so you take it out all of that you don't want to eat that so you take it out now the best type of chicken broth is when you're baking your chicken why is this the best chicken broth because when you bake chicken you don't add water to it you just put it in the pan with your seasoning and it's going to create its own juices and the juices that you're going to get from this that chicken broth that you're going to get it's going to be straight chicken broth with nothing added no water or anything sometimes when you ball where every time you boil your chicken you're adding water to it in order to boil it so you're diluting what would be your chicken broth this way you get the straight chicken broth look at all that fat you don't want it so any place that you see excess fat just go ahead and take it off now look at the fat is a good thing because that's going to help to create your chicken broth so a little bit of fat you don't worry about it but an enormous amount of fat take it up and see that's the lamb that was what I was telling you about that you don't want to eat excess skin it don't want it take off we cleaned out that back any more fat left take my thumb just going and give it that little piece if it's the last part over the fence which is the piece that I showed you don't see it see if I can find one here's one right here see if you don't eat that and just cut it off you can save it and make some chicken broth with it if you want to or you can just go ahead and use the chicken ball but this is the best chicken broth so don't throw away this it's going to be a lot halfway through the cooking process and I'll show it to you but don't throw it away freeze it excess fat just take it off that that you can't get off with your hand just get your knife go ahead and take it off okay and it's lamb but anything that you see that you don't want look at that yeah I went right and then got it put your thumb right in there the tick all of it out let me take all of that and you toss it now a lot of people don't clean their chicken because they don't know how to do it or whatever reasons they don't clean it but I do so if you want to start cleaning your chicken this is the way to do it I'm going to cut one more piece if you like skin leave it on I don't need it so I'm taking it off invest in you a good pair of these cutting shears they only like three ninety-nine and that's a great thing to have in your kitchen when you're going to be cutting stuff now this one is clear it is very clear see that that is very clear you can see it so all your chicken legs before I do it though take some of this oh okay now I'm going to go straight down there watch it then when I go straight down don't cut it you know this chicken is slamming because I got my hands out here see that got me to pieces out of that I see a little bit more slime get it off and then I will get this little bit of fat okay a lot of people ask me about how you clean it and I just want to show you how you would go ahead and clean it then once you get through taking all of this stuff off of it then you can go ahead and wash your piece of chicken now I had the rest of this to do down in here so I'm going to go ahead and do it and then I'm going to season this I'm going to bake it off uncovered in my oven 350 degrees what I will do first is I will cover this chicken for the first probably 45 minutes of cooking what it does is if I have it covered it's going to go ahead and produce the chicken broth that it means too because it's actually steaming down the chicken there's going to be no water in this at all the only thing I'm going to have is just my chicken pieces with the seasonings on top so that means I'm going to get some good broth that I can use at a later date so I'm going to put this in my 350 degree oven allow it to cook covered for that first what 45 minutes maybe of cooking and then I'm going to take that cover off and let this chicken finish cooking why am i doing it that way because at that time I want my chicken to brown on the top and I want my chicken to have a crispy tight topping on it I don't want it to be very very crispy like just something like bacon I don't want it like that but I want it to brown and I'm the the top of it to be more crisper than the inside and I want the inside to be tender so I'm going to go away finish cutting up this chicken and finish going ahead and clean in my chicken and then I'll bring your back midway through the process of me cooking the chicken just to show you the broth and to remove the broth wait until it cooled and in freezer for a later date and continue to cook the chicken so I'll be back just went to show you that okay now I'm at the stove and I'm getting ready to put my chicken in the oven my oven is go on 350 degrees and like I told you I'm going to put this in the oven let it cook for the first 45 minutes on top of it I want to show you there's absolutely no water in this pan a little bit of drainage you see which is a very small amount it's coming from you know just a chicken having being put in there just already seasoned so I'm going to cover this with a piece of aluminum for now when it seemed the theme is going to arrive the min is going to go back down but that's going to cause the moisture to come from the chicken and that's how you get your chicken broth so that's why I'm allowing this to cook first and cover it up for the first 45 minutes then I'm going to remove it and cook it the rest of the right but when you have it like this your thing will go back down producing moisture and that's what's going to happen give you your your chicken broth and this is the best chicken broth as I told you to use so make certain that you save that put it up you can freeze it for up to six months so you don't have to worry about it freeze it and use it if you freeze it in your ice cube tray then you can just use one or two kings of chicken broth at a time you don't have to use it all so I'm going to put it in the oven and I'm going to allow it to cook now after 45 minutes I'll bring you back and I'll show you what it looks like when we get ready to drain the juice off or the chicken broth all of the chicken be right back and actually my chicken has been any of for about an hour really because I started to do something else so I just want to take it I'll show you the release of stage getting ready to take this off now I want to show you you see all those liquids down in there remember I told you that these liquids came from the chicken itself okay and these are the best this is the best chicken stock that you're going to get because you remember I added no water to this at all so now I'm going to take the total liquid from the chicken take off the cover which was not in the foil and I'm going to put this back in my oven and let it brown up [Music] okay now port you got just a minimal amount of liquids down in the bottom I poured it off now I'm going to put it back in my oven and I'm going to allow it to brown on top now so what you look at this see how rich that chicken stock is model take this chicken stock and let it cool and then I'm going to put this in my refrigerator and freezer and this is what I'll use for meals to come okay you just want to show you that be right back and show you what the chicken looks like once it Brown maybe about another 30 minutes be right back okay take my chicken out the oven now chicken is ready see my chicken that's why your chicken is supposed to look when you're baking it off my chicken is ready now I can just do my dinner my cabbage is ready back in the back pot heaven cabbage that's ready my dirty rice is ready and my chicken is ready okay just want to show you what I was having for them today I'm not going to dish it up I think that if you try this chicken you're truly going to enjoy it this is my version of bacon chickens you can use whatever seasonings it is that you want to use but as always thank you for watching
