right this week my mates in ginger peak have sought me out some top-quality lamb for a lamb burger oh the thing-thing it was called a Larry it's very juicy like myself moans of happiness you might say might say mountain of mind your trousers right guys welcome back to the street kitchen now this week I wanted to cook something for my neighbors so I'm gonna make a beautiful lamb burger but I'm gonna make the ultimate lamb burger by getting all the best mates to get on with lamb together so anchovy in the burger salty and sweet I've got pea shoots going on the top it's so good with lamb almonds in an almond pesto off and then to finish it off I've got some goat cheese it's gonna be delicious first up I'm gonna use shallots you could use onions for this but she lots of sweet and it's gonna really help so we're just gonna dice it down just take the skin off and then you've seen me do it a thousand times I want nice small dice okay then get that into your bowl now I want two teaspoons of garlic powder just drop that in and then you've got your beautiful anchovies now you put how many you want in I'm gonna put quite a lot in because I want that salty sweet flavor but I'm gonna hold back on the sea salt when I put that in so four or five nice big Phillips and then we're just going to cook through those and you're kind of getting it down I'm working it till it's obliterate it into a paste right into the bowl and then we want 500 grams of lamb mince drop that in salt and pepper and then hands in bring it all together so just get it there and that's that and now it's time to make into patties we're looking to make sort of 200 gram burgers and you can use your scales I'm pretty good at getting them right this has got a fair bit of air in it because I've had it all mixed in together so slap it in your hand and what that does is is it's forcing the air out and compounding all the meat so it will cook more evenly and then another little tip that you can do is then start forming it into your pate [Music] then stop forming it into your patty and then you can take a ring put that down put the patty into it and just push it in to the sides all round the ring and that way you're going to get a nice shaped burger that looks quite professional in its presentation that's gonna be beautiful right let's crack on and make a load more [Music] okay I'm gonna drop these lamb burgers in the fridge for about an hour just so they set so they don't fall apart when I cook them then I'll get them out 20 minutes before and then we'll cook okay so I'm gonna make a parsley and almond pesto no it's not a traditional pesto but the almonds in the pasta will work so well with the lamb and you may notice new era new cane he's back said an upgrade now he's gonna make a big difference to this pesto now this my friends is the blade to the Blitzer it's been in the freezer and it's super cold and it's going to make such a difference to the pesto the reason why I've put that blade in the freezer is because when you normally blitz something in a food processor the blade heats up with all the friction because that's freezing cold it's going to keep it cold which means it's going to keep the beautiful green color and it will make all the difference to the presentation and some of the flavor so let's load it up and make a pesto first up I'm just gonna tell this garlic drop that in now I'm gonna get just a few our moons because what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make the base I'm gonna blitz it all down finely and then I'm going to add other ingredients to make it a bit chunky about 10 almonds drop those in just a little bit of parmesan a little bit of parsley and then just get some good quality extra virgin olive oil pour that in so we can just make a initial base so and then just now you can see that the garlic's been completely blitzed down you don't want big chunks of garlic that's why I'm doing it in two slots okay rest of ingredients in a good chunk of almonds go in there we want a good scrunch of parsley the rest of the parmesan in I'm just worried chopping that up because it's gonna get cut in there and then get the lid back on and blitz it down now we don't I don't want to do it loads because I don't want it super thin I want it quite chunky so it sits on the burger now look how beautiful green that is it gives you an idea of how much flavor is in there and if you just look at this it just looks beautiful so well with the burger okay that's the pesto done now we've got a food bus key in the house Perez he's just having a coffee watching while we're doing next up I want to show you it's really simple but it's just a little bit of a goat's cheese Mayo sort of vibe so first stop we're gonna combine these two ingredients at 150 grams of goat's cheese to about 60 mils of creme fraiche nice good pinch of salt and whip it together then what this is gonna add it's gonna add an indulgent cheesy creaminess with the perfect cheese that goes with lamb go she's gonna be so indulgent okay so these lamb burgers have been out the fridge for a good 20 minutes they hold together really well time to cook so just gonna get a little bit of salt on there and then I'm gonna get them in to my griddle pan [Music] they're juicy as hell let's build this baby so goat cheese cream let's just get that on to the burger then grab your first burger scoop him up and drop him on oh haha that looks good okay next up we've got our beautiful pesto let's get a nice generous slather from that onto the burger then your next burger drop him on more naughtiness on the top then get a little bit of pee shoot now the piece chute peas and lamb are just best mates work so well it's got a sweetness to it and then the rocket has got a pepperiness to it it's going to just be your beautiful salad relief to all the naughtiness that's going on we're gonna drop it on the top then you just want a little dollop on the top put your top on and that my brothers and
