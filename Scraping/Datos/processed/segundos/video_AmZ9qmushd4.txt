[Music] this is the easiest most delicious roasted beef tenderloin that you will ever make it's guaranteed to be flavorful super bouncy super juicy and so easy you will not believe it i'm laura vitale and on this episode of blaring in kitchen i'm going to show you how i make my roasted beef tenderloin now there are many ways that you can make a beef tenderloin in terms of flavor i like to keep mine very simple especially when it comes to making it for a holiday meal because i want the flavors to sort of complement everything else so i always just use rosemary and garlic and i do a little bit of red wine and it's delicious and i serve it with a horseradish sour cream sauce and it's just loved by all you can do different rubs on it if you want to like i said for a holiday because it is a pricey cut of me i like to keep it basic so that it goes with my roast potatoes and my broccolini and my salads just perfectly so let's get into it this is very easy you're going to love it the first thing i've done is preheat my oven to 425 i want it really hot this is a beef tenderloin um some parts of it will be a little bit fatty but it's been well trimmed i trimmed this myself but i would suggest you get you butchered to do that if you are not so familiar with cleaning a tenderloin because you really don't want to waste it you don't want to mess with it if you don't know what you're doing because it is pretty expensive right so the method does not change on based on the size of your beef tenderloin this isn't that big it's about three pounds uh which is sort of perfect for i would say six people because i mean it's my time it shrinks it'll be a little under three pounds and that's feeding six people very well so we're gonna go ahead and get started the first thing i'm gonna do so i told you i have the oven preheated the next thing i'm going to do is cut a bunch of kitchen twine because i and you we have to tie this beef tenderloin you don't want to miss or skip this part because otherwise everything would just kind of be uneven and trust me it's a necessary part of this whole shebang i also have a large skillet preheating over medium high heat and it is an ovenproof skillet because i'm going to take the skillet and throw it right into the oven once i get all these cut and i start tying my tenderloin then we can talk about thermometers that i think is really important when you're cooking ketamine like this especially an expensive kadami because you don't want to risk overcooking it so let me get all these cut and then we move forward okay so i'm going to season my board and the reason i do that is because i find it just a little bit easier to do this to season the underside of my roast that makes any sense it works just trust me i got this tip from jamie oliver years ago and watch see perfectly seasoned on the bottom beautiful and now i take a little bit of salt and we do this on the top and on the sides unseasoned meat is probably like one of the worst things on the planet so season and season it well now you're wondering hey oh you forgot to put the garlic in the rosemary well here's the thing we're going to roast this into the oven at a really high temperature what i do not want is for that rosemary and garlic to burn if i were to sear it in a really hot pan now and then throw it into the oven so what i do is i sear this as is right and then i combine garlic rosemary a little bit of salt and pepper and some olive oil and then i smear all over the whole thing before it goes into the oven and you just wait it's phenomenal okay my pan is hot and it's ready and i want to sear this on all sides take some oil um i want to sear this on all sides so i'm just going to be very patient about it i'm not going to rush the process oh let's talk thermometers okay um i know that you're not going to want to hear this from me but you need to invest in an oven safe thermometer for your meats okay this is a therm pro i have two of these because i love these so much what this does is it allows you to set the temperature of the meat that you want like the temperature that you want to cook that right so i like my meat on my tenderloin i like to pull it out of the oven in 125 and it will carry over cook a little like five to seven more degrees so i set it at 125 and then before it goes into the oven i will stick the probe in there and this sits on the counter and this sits into the oven right and when it reaches 125 it will beep and then i know my meat is perfectly cooked it doesn't have to i don't have to worry obviously if you don't have one of those and you have a regular meat thermometer you're gonna have to check it um i don't like to pull it out any earlier any later than 125 because i like mine quite pink but hey it's totally up to you you can change that number however your heart desires but it's a tenderloin so please don't take it out at medium well or well done or i will cry because that is expensive and it needs to be buttery so i'm gonna clear i'm gonna wash my hands and then we get going on chopping up with the garlic and the rosemary [Music] so i went ahead and chopped up the rosemary and the garlic and i'm gonna go ahead and add a touch of salt to it because when i do this to the garlic and the rosemary with the the salt it kind of starts to create a more of a paste um which i really like but you don't really i mean it's necessary no but i really like it the beef is looking i mean really gorgeous look at that don't forget the ends it takes literally a second but it is important look at that oh my word i mean you just know it's going to be fantastic right look at that beauty okay turning this down now because it's done its thing go ahead and turning it down it just smells so good it smells so good i also feel like when it comes to tenderloin i you know it's such a prime cut of meat and you're spending a pretty penny on it so i don't want to muck about with flavors too much because i don't want to lose the buttery flavor of the tenderloin so that's why i like to keep it like that okay so to that i'm just going to add a little bit of olive oil i'm also going to go ahead and take a pretty big size onion so i may just do half i put it around because when i add a bit of wine and a bit of water to the pan it does create really delicious flavor for a sauce it's fantastic i'm gonna go ahead just do this with my hands don't recommend use a spoon but you know me i like living on the edge and now that will be amazing as it roasts into the oven that flavor will be in the sauce that will then end up being drizzled on the sliced beef just gonna let that sit there for a second so i can wash my hands and then we're gonna add a little bit of wine and our thermometer and we throw it into the oven stick the probe in beautiful okay time has started we're going to go ahead and add a bit of wood half and a bit of red wine and now i'm going to go ahead and throw this in my really hot oven to roast until the internal temperature hits 125 a size like this it's going to take 20 minutes no longer you'll see so wish me luck a big pan but you know i don't work out for nothing you know what i'm saying i mean i'm not that buff but i try yeah get that in the thermometer will live up here as my friend tony soprano used to say boom i'm gonna clean and i'll see you soon a rhyme again i mean i'm on this on the ball okay so i roasted it until the thickest part reached 125 now i cover it with some aluminum foil when it comes out so that it does carry overcook and i carried it over to about 135. you can see i hope you can see anyway you can just tell by how bouncy it is that it's going to be pretty rare which is kind of how i like it but the the frontier will be a little bit more cooked so if that kind of freaks you out to see you know red meat then you you know cook it a little bit longer it's totally up to you i just would not cook a piece of meat this pricey like i said well done because it has no fat so it's very lean you've got very little fat running through it so it's just going to dry it out and be shoe leather and nobody wants that before you slice it make sure you get rid of your strings you don't want to eat that and now look in the pan it created a gorgeous sauce to spoon over the sliced beef i'm also going to serve it with a horseradish cream sauce which i will actually have the recipe for you in the same recipe that this would be on and this is going to be on my website i'm going to have that recipe there for you as well with this one because the two together are pretty phenomenal and i just love it so strings are almost all gone and then we get to slicing make sure that you please let your meat rest for at least 10 minutes because otherwise you're going to be washing off you're going to basically all the goodness from the inside is going to wash out so string is out let's give this a little cut so these would be a little bit more cooked and then as you get to the thicker part they will be a bit more rare which is exactly how i like it like i said this is a prime piece of meat so i don't want to cook this until it's well done or even close but to me this right here is perfection see that beautiful and that was taken out at 125 so if you take it out any you know more then as it sits it will carry over cook so you're just gonna have to be careful and i am slicing very thick slices and that's very generous but hey if you're not going to feed your people generously then what's the point at least that's my opinion right and like i said you can certainly cook this to whatever temperature you like some people will say that even this is a little bit too well done i think it's pretty perfect it tends to please everyone even those that don't like their meat really underdone so i'm gonna reserve that for me i'm gonna pour the juices in there and then what i do is i kind of mix those around like that which is what my nana would do i'm going to move this closer to me and that's my piece right there this is my piece right here which i mean really it slices like butter right delicious i already know oh my word then you take this beautiful sauce that i just literally pour it all over the place move this pan closer right that would make so much more sense it's just so phenomenal such a crowd pleaser everyone loves it the meat really shines through the rosemary and garlic will go so well with the rest of my menu nothing is going to compete i do a little bit of fresh rosemary around and some fresh parsley to really make it shine and that is a gorgeous feast that is so perfect i like to hit it with just a touch of salt because the inside of the meat you know makes really everything stand out and that is it's perfect it's simple the technique is very easy the technique works with every size of tenderloin that you have so it doesn't really matter just do it this way you cook it this way and it will be perfect every single time go to laura in the kitchen.com for the written recipe i'm staring at it like it's going to walk away from me alrightykitchen.com has a great recipe for you hope you've enjoyed spending time with me i hope that you make this for your holiday table or just any special occasion um it's butter i mean it is literally butter and this pan sauce it cooks itself recipes there i'll see you next time bye [Music]
