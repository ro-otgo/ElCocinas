hello everybody it is Michael Brownstein here from the food and wine Life channel and I'm here with the beautiful ever play and today Eva is going to make beef bourguignon beef bourguignon is everybody's favorite in my household uh it's a great holiday dish it doesn't take long to make and it's a traditional French dish today I made the bourguignon that is very simple easy to follow directions and it's not that complicated like everybody is trying to make it out to be so I hope you've enjoyed this recipe it comes out every time it comes out delicious smooth the the flavors the texture and it's a real crowd pleaser [Music] okay so first step in our beef bourguignon will be we'll add a little bit of butter just for flavor and a little bit um olive olive oil in our pan just to coat it slightly okay and since our pan is pretty hot I'll just melt it melt the powder pretty quick and then we'll add some bacon roughly chopped bacon that's about six ounces and 12 Brown it we'll cook it till it's brown and starting to crisp up so now since uh our bacon browned a little bit um well take it out of the pot drain it a little bit and put it in the another container because we'll use it later do that okay let me do this yeah that um if you're cooking on this uh gas stove make sure you don't burn yourself so okay so now we're gonna add a little bit of beef at the time so it Browns nicely and easily on each side we don't want to overdo it so a few pieces at the time [Music] and it's called Browner and we'll repeat the steps like we did with the bacon foreign the beef right now to a nice caramelized edges so when the beef Browns then we'll add it to the pot where the bacon is so right here I made some homemade crushed pepper from all peppercorns like this and um this is just way better you can use a small food processor to um to grind your peppercorns and to add extra flavor to the whole dish okay after we Brown all the beef and we place that to another pot [Music] well add a little bit more butter to this okay so let's cut this a little bit maybe a tablespoon of butter whatever you need and melt it and we'll put our carrots in it and we'll cook them a little bit to Brown them so after a little while uh we'll add our onions I have two chopped onions in here and again we'll spread the onions a little bit okay so now we'll add our garlic to the mixture and we'll cook that for a minute but while we're doing that we also can add um our bay leaves I put four bay leaves they're pretty good but um I use them for aromatics and I love aromatics in my dishes plus the fresh ground pepper [Music] and a few pinches of salt but be careful with salt because we'll add stock to it and salty already so now we'll add our flour okay and we'll coat all the veggies with the flour so we don't get lumps and next we add our stock and two cups of beef stock okay we'll mix it a little bit and then we have two cups of wine red wine I have Cabernet Sauvignon you can use any wine that you drank I would suggest do not use cooking wine or anything that you wouldn't drink so my my base my sauce was getting a little thick so I added a cup of water to it you can add more water because um it depends on the moisture of the flour sunflower has a little bit more water depends on your pantry and where you live Etc so I guess the flowering in This was um need it a little bit it was dry so I needed more moisture so then I'll add about a tablespoon or two some let me stir around and a little bit of uh thyme and I love thyme so I'll put a little bit more than you might like but thyme is really good in it and we'll cook it down and then we can take out the I sprayed at the end and right now after we have all that done we'll add the meat and the bacon that we cooked previously okay so now we have our bacon and our beef all together with the sauce we'll stir around so it coats easily but all our aromatics salt and pepper and we're getting ready to put it um in the oven for about three to four hours okay so it's ready to go into the oven so we're cooking it for about three to four hours in the oven part of beef bourguignon that when you're at this stage you just put in the oven for about three at 300 degrees and leave it in the oven for about two and a half to three hours I'll check after that time see where you're at with your dish and in the meantime you can work on your side dishes so we're going to check on our progress looks really good uh let me get a little fork in here and see if it's fork tender oh no it's it's about a couple more hours that's for sure we're at Mark of hour and a half so it's starting to look great and smells great wait okay so we had some olive oil and now we're adding a little butter we're gonna melt the batter and we'll saute the mushrooms to finish up our beef bourguignon Dish as you can see on the back we have we started some potato for mashed potatoes I'm gonna serve them with potatoes today so as we melted our butter we'll add our mushroom and we'll satayam until they get the brown and then we'll finish them up with salt pepper and a little bit of garlic so we just took out our beef bourguignon from the oven oh oh it's fork tender definitely so it's ready for us to add our mushrooms so right now we have those cooked mushrooms beautifully browned I'm gonna add them to the dish it's heavy okay and then we're gonna stir it together and we'll wait for the potatoes to cook and we'll be ready to serve our dinner this is the finished product over the mashed potatoes with little green chives well we're back and we're fixing to do a taste test let's see so as you can tell the beef is fork tender let's see and uh the sauce looks very smooth silky oh yeah maybe yeah I did yourself on this one you like it yeah you did a great job well it was simple just few hours in the oven the rest easy peasy so um we'll see you next time cheers cheers
