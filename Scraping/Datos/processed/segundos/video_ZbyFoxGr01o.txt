[Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel so today's recipe is this beautiful and perfect roast chicken if you like to know how i made this then please give orchard so the first thing i will be doing is to mix my dry rub for the chicken and for this i will be using some black pepper garlic powder raspberry smoked paprika ginger powder bouillon cubes onion powder salt and some thyme [Music] and i'm just going to mix this thoroughly and then i will set aside for years later you don't have to use every single spice that i use here you can use pretty much anything that you want this is just what works for me so i've got my chicken here and it is approximately 2.5 kg and i'm just going to get rid of the extra moisture using some kitchen towel [Music] and at this time i'm just going to spray some cooking oil on the chicken and massaging dip into it you can use pretty much any kind of oil that you prefer you can also use butter [Music] and once the chicken is well oiled i will begin to coat it with the dry rub again i will make sure that the chicken is well coated and at this time i'm going to lift the skin around the chicken breast separating the skin from the meat and then i'm going to apply some of the spice rub into it and make sure that it penetrates deep into it and that is for absolute flavor [Music] and once the chicken is well coated i will be covering it with some cling film and i will leave this to marinade for about four hours you can do anything between one to 24 hours but i'm pressed for time so i will just be doing about four hours and after marination this is what the chicken looks like and at this time i will begin to add a bit more of the spice rub onto it [Music] and after that i will begin to stuff the cavity and to do this i will be using some garlic a little bit of lemon and some thyme [Music] so [Music] and after stuffing the cavity i will be tying the chicken legs together with a twine if you haven't got a twine you can use some dental floss or some foil [Music] and at this time i'm going to transfer my chicken onto my baking tray and then i'm going to cover it with a bit more oil now you can also use butter for this if you prefer now i elevated my tray using a rack you don't have to use this you can use some onions or pretty much any kind of vegetables that you prefer i just prefer to use a rack instead and after doing this i will be transferring the chicken into my preheated oven my oven is preheated to 190 degrees celsius and i will be baking this for 30 minutes so this is just a bonus it's not part of the recipe at all but because i'm aware that some people would want to know how i made my super gorgeous vegetables as well i'm just going to quickly show you so in here i've got some red potatoes as well as carrots and to this i will be adding some oil and also about two tablespoons of the dry rub and just in case you're wondering why i didn't just do a one pan dish that's roasting the chicken and the potatoes in the same pan well when i'm working with whole chicken i really don't like to do that and that's because of the long cooking time and also sometimes you end up with soggy vegetables and i really don't want that i prefer my vegetables to be a bit dry and i know some people do that because of the chicken drapings you know because because it tastes really nice for the vegetables but trust me if you season your vegetables right if you do it properly you won't miss the chicken drippings at all so after that i'm going to place this in my oven for about 45 minutes at 190 degrees celsius and after 45 minutes this is what it looks like absolutely beautiful this potatoes honestly they taste absolutely gorgeous and i'm just going to set this aside for when the chicken is ready and we're back to the chicken so this is what it looks like after 30 minutes of roasting absolutely beautiful at this time i'm just going to test it with some of the oil in the pan just so it doesn't end up being too dry and then place it back in the oven so the total cooking time is 90 minutes so you will need to do this twice during that time so like i said i'm going to put this back in the oven and after an hour and a half this is what it looks like absolutely beautiful isn't it and the best way to check for donuts is to stick a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh if it comes up reading anything between 165 and 175 degrees celsius then you know that it is ready and just look at that isn't this the most beautiful roast you've ever seen be honest and here it is served with the potatoes and carrots all you need now is some really good homemade gravy and you're good to go [Music] how gorgeous is this chicken just see how beautiful succulent and juicy it is falling off the bone i mean it should be on your christmas menu there is no reason at all why it shouldn't be and please if you try this recipe do let me know how you get them by leaving me a comment and do not forget to
