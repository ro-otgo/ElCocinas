hey guys it's matt with meat church well today i'm crazy excited to be bringing you a texas size colossal surf and turf on what ought to be the first ever cooking video on youtube on the brand new traeger timberline xl [Music] well this is going to be an awesome meal and i couldn't be more excited i've been cooking on this trigger timberline xl for about six months i was in the beta program this one's actually brand new and what i'm going to show you today could apply to any cooker but i've you know got to feature this super sexy new grill never even been cooked on so this meat is going to be the first thing that i put in this grill and look at all this room tons of great new features which i'll talk about as we cook but the number one feature to me it's got an induction burner over here which everybody's been waiting on so we're going to reverse sear this steak today you all know i cook steaks a lot of different ways but why would you not smoke one and sear it here on this induction burner and we're not just talking steak today i mean take a look over here at the size of this lobster tail so for comparison this is a 32 ounce bone-in tomahawk rib eye and it is dwarfed by this lobster that i got from my friends at lobster anywhere i actually paid for this because i wanted to use their stuff it's so good they ship it overnight and i bought a size smaller than this and they sent me this ginormous one knowing what we were doing this is uh this is the biggest lobster tail i've ever seen in my life but this steak shout out to my man jared the market manager at heb in waxahachie he cut this for me this morning this is a prime tomahawk rib eye that looks really good so i'm going to grab some of my holy cow by the way first new feature here or second this pop and lock system rail system on the traeger timberline xl i can put a little caddy here to put my seasonings in i've also got a shelf on that caddy and over here i've got my butcher paper holder totally customizable you can move things around but this is the setup that i dig so i can easily grab my holy cow so we're going to do reverse here today two-step process we're gonna smoke this steak at 250 degrees until it's like 115 120 internal i'm gonna pull it off and with this cast iron i have on top of the induction burner i'm going to sear it get a nice hard crust on the steak by the way love induction because that surface won't get hot when there's not a pan on it so my kids aren't going to burn themselves and it's cast iron which is my favorite way to sear a steak so let me get this holy cow going here get my seal off here and we're going to season nice and simple holy cow is salt pepper and garlic it's a very texas rub it's mostly salt and pepper a little bit of garlic season how you want season with what you want maybe you just want salt and pepper this thing doesn't need a lot of trim because jared hooked it up for us so nice kind of moderate application holy cow is by far and away my family's favorite steak seasoning got that nice big 16 mesh coarse cracked pepper in there i love to leave seasoning on for about an hour uh sitting out at ambient temperature but i'm not gonna wait that long we're gonna wait like 15 minutes today so i'm gonna let this adhere and i'm going to come back and we're going to get to cooking all right guys our seasoning is nice and adhered so let's get in here on the cook so i'm going to put it right here on this middle grate while this seasoning was adhering i went ahead and took the top grate out just so you could see a little better let's talk thermometers you guys are used to these leave-in thermometers this new grill comes with two of these but traeger is sending you two of these wireless meter probes with this grille and actually will support four so this grille can support six thermometers through the app so i love these wireless meter probes i've been using these since uh these guys were a kickstarter way before traeger acquired them and i love this because i can just insert it right here into the middle i'm going to go right in the heart i want that tip right in the heart of the stake i can monitor this temperature through my app so i'll know exactly when it hits 115. all right i'm gonna close this up um we're rocking here 250 degrees let's talk about the cook for just a second you could smoke lower like 225 with super smoke if you want to impart more smoke into your steak you could cook a little hotter if you don't have as much time you go 275 it really doesn't matter it's your preference i'm going good middle of the road smoking temperature 250 degrees with meat church pellets by the way when we fire this thing up you can't help but notice the full color display amazing user experience a ton of fun but we're going to cook this thing probably about 45 minutes we're going to 115 internal like i said and i'll talk to you about that when we come back from that if you want to go higher lower kind of where you want to be so i'm thinking it's going to take about 45 minutes i'll allow yourself an hour so i'm going to go get that lobster ready now all right steaks cooking so let's go ahead and jump into this monster lobster tail i'm just going to tell you right now i've actually never cooked one this big and you know may not be all that practical for you all to cook one this big at home but hey everything is bigger in texas i like to cut the shell open pull the meat out on top and season it this one might take a surgical team to get right so scalpel let's go actually mr meister poultry shears i'm gonna get in here and just cut this taking these shears and just cutting right under the skin right across here under the shell i should say [Music] so i'd like to bring my hands in here under the shell and just kind of release the meat from the shell just kind of all down the sides here so i'm gonna do that real quick and then we're going to pull it out [Music] just kind of release it from the bottom here all right so i've got most of that out [Music] there we go look at that beauty right there man i got to tell you lobster is probably my most favorite food uh this and a gallon of butter and i'm gonna be set for the day look at that all right y'all i'm gonna go get my seafood seasoning we're gonna season her up and then when the steak is done we're gonna put this on all right let's get this uh lobster seasoned up i mean look how beautiful this thing looks we've got our beautiful little lobster curtains like we're about to be live on a broadway show here the show is about to begin all right so we've got our seafood seasoning and our voodoo use what you like um i love voodoo on seafood so i'm gonna do a little light application of this and mostly go with our seafood seasoning our seafood seasoning something we don't talk about nearly enough but it's great on lobster it's got a little bit of a bite to it so i love it okay i'm gonna get here on the sides and then our steak is about ready to come off at which point we're going to crank the traeger up because we want to cook this lobster at a much higher temperature and then it's going to be time to sear that steak and get to eating the best lunch i've had in quite some time all right guys i see the steaks at 115 degrees internal through the app uh and the wireless meter probe so i'm going to pull that steak off and then i'm going to increase the temperature of this grill because i want to cook this lobster around 400 degrees so that it doesn't get rubbery so let's pull the stake out and it looks awesome great color already i'm going to go ahead and crank the temp up i'm going to go 400. people do lobster 350 to 500 higher temperature uh so that the meat doesn't get too rubbery so i'm going to go 400 which is kind of like right in the middle of kind of where i like to cook it and it'll just take about two minutes to get up to temp so i'm going to go ahead and put this in this is going to take a little bit to cook [Music] let's go pretty side out [Music] there we go we're looking for the seafood's 145 degrees so i'm probably gonna pull it by 140 uh you know i never like to overcook my stuff and it'll continue to carry over cook a little bit so here's the timing deal with this cook i'm going to lightly tint this steak with some foil which i have here let it hang out and rest now the tail is pretty big and it's going to take a little bit to cook most of you will probably be cooking a little smaller tail so i'm going to go over to my induction burner i'm going to turn it on i want this cast iron here over 500 degrees to sear this i'm going to give it a few minutes i'm going to turn it on we'll do that together and we're going to sear uh one minute aside and then let this continue to hook we're going to kind of time it to get them both out at the same time so i'm going to let this sit here about 10 minutes before i turn that on i'm going to check this cast iron see where we're at on that and then we'll sear this steak off all right guys before we sear the steak i'm going to baste this lobster often now i've melted down some butter uh with the juice of a lemon some garlic some parsley and a little bit of our holy voodoo and i just i'm gonna keep this nice and moist so i'm gonna baste a lot plus i love butter like i always say here to help you lose weight i'm here to help you enjoy life i'm gonna do this at least two or three times now it's time to get that induction burner and go in here in a second so we can sear all right let's get to this sear so i've turned the induction burner on and i turned it all the way up to 10 which is sear i want to get this cast iron over 500 degrees which it got up to that temp super quick with my thermoworks ir gun we're at 525 that's after i put some oil on it got a little peanut oil on there and here we go yeah if there's ever any questions about if it could sear we've just answered that so let's talk about this cook process on the reverse here i'm a medium rare guy actually a little under medium rare so medium rare is 130 135 internal so we smoked this to 115. i'm gonna sear about 90 seconds aside look at it if i want to go more because i like a lot of crush we might go two minutes you can adjust all this to your liking um if you like a medium steak then i would have smoked that to like 125 maybe even 130 and you know sear for as long as you want to get a really good crust it's going to take a good 90 seconds like i said maybe two minutes but we'll check in with this in just a second and see how we're doing all right we've been 90 seconds let's see how we're doing oh that crust looks awesome that's good with me so back on the other side all right this has been going 90 seconds that looks awesome all right i'm gonna take this over to the butcher block put a compound butter on it and rest it and check on that lobster all right the steak is done so let's check the lobster man that looks awesome oh yeah we're not high 130s one part 140 on another part all right man this uh smells even more amazing than it looks we've thrown a little parsley on the lobster to make it pretty but you know never going to be too mad about a little more butter on there squeeze a little one more lemon man that looks good but we're going to scooch that out of the way let's uh slice this steak and we've let this rest it's been sitting here for probably 15 minutes we put a compound butter with a bunch of herbs in it right here on the top of the you know on the steak that melted over it while it rested well i'll just go this way foreign getting the spineless man that looks so so good i don't know where to go first to be honest with you but i've been dreaming about this uh since we ordered it so probably going right here this makes it nice and easy sitting right up here on top we could just cut the whole thing away but you know i might just give me a little piece right here i don't know about a little piece maybe a maybe a humongous piece look at that man it smells so so good ah that's gigantic maybe a little little butter dip that's amazing going for the forbidden second bite man i love lobster that i really like the seafood combination of the seafood seasoning combination of the seafood uh in the voodoo on it but basted in that butter it's just like super rich and decadent and that's probably the last meal on earth candidate for me um let's just jump right in here to the stake so good system well heck i don't need a dang knife what am i doing super simple and super delicious ah that's good that was too easy on that brand new sexy grill but dude you can't be this colossal texas surfing turf with the biggest lobster i've ever seen in my life uh and this this prime bone-in cowboy rib eye that we got just right down the street here this has been super good the new grill ton of fun uh we got a lot of videos coming out on it naturally
