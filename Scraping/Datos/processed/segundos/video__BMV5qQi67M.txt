have one red onion and some green onions over here and these are two tomatoes that have just diced they were large and here we have some salt to taste some chili over here just to make things spicy not too much because i'm with a chili head here have some curry powder but i'm just going to scrape a little bit some freshly grounded black pepper here are some his smoked paprika that i'm going to use for some color for that i'm choosy and obviously we can't forget this bad boy over here this is garlic powder garlic just makes things so flavorful so please if you don't have this try and get one and you can also if you don't have garlic powder you can use garlic fresh garlic and i also have with me here one like four cloves of garlic more garlic as you had a finger of ginger and one tablespoon of tomato paste and some lime because you know fish loves like fish and some touch filling is just on another level and for the coating of the fish this is a fillet and here with me is two tablespoons of all-purpose flour and we're just going to add some spices from here and coat the fish fillet and just fry them on the pan that's it so it can be crunchy and then cut your corner flavor to come choose a sour so let's begin with a cooking action i'll start by patch drying this fish fillet that's why i have my paper towel here i'm just going to cut it dry with the paper towel and now i want to just slice it into four pieces [Music] and there i have it so i'm just going to flavor up my flour and coat them to my all-purpose flour i'm going to add some paprika some garlic powder i'm just using the spices that i'm going to use in the choozy because i don't want to to bite into a very all-purpose flour without flavor that is some curry powder and here i have some freshly grounded black pepper some salt to taste casey two then we're going to mix this i know i'm using a joke but it's cute it's cute there goes my flour and even before i pat my i dip my face and patch it right again i want to make sure it's dry you can see by the imagination [Music] foreign [Music] oh my god i thought they were boneless this person should be checked then i have my second piece i'm just going to cut this [Music] they don't want broken pieces shake off the excess put it aside that the other one shake off the excess put it aside shake off the excess put it aside dab the other one make

my fish and place so guys my fish is cooking and i just let it cook on each side for about two to three minutes and i want to exchange like here at the bathroom here i can show you how we're going to make that intrusion here so i want to extend it and start cooking so let's not turn on our feet let's can cook on the other side be careful that there's no bliss oh my god they look let me not even talk too much [Music] on the other side let's make very choosy then i'm going to add my onions [Music] we're just going to let it cook and you can also see the fish is also cooking i've set it to low heat over there oh my god let's let this the onions to cook until they are golden brown or something then you can add the rest of the ingredients our onions are brown they look so nice and now i'm
