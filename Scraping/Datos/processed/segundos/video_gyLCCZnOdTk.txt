this is the beef stew you gotta try friends super easy to do remember if you like the channel subscribe gives us a thumbs up and don't forget to ring the bells gotta try the recipe it's fabulous okay friends this is a fabulous beef stew you're gonna love it all right first thing we're gonna do is uh we're gonna get our pot ready and um i got some uh ground chuck i mean some ground trucks i got some chuck roast right there that i just cut up in uh in in uh in little pieces i mean little pieces they're kind of like a big big bite right you can cut them in half with a fork when you cook and uh and we caramelize them so i have a few of them i want to show you how to do that i got some onion and i'm gonna saute some pearl onion i like a pearl onion so it's nice and uh and and good looking i was looking for chipolini onion today i couldn't get them chipollini chipolini is a it's a little flat onion but that big right there it's a little flatter and uh it's really really delicious but i couldn't i couldn't find any so i got the um the the onion right there the pearl onion i'm gonna put them in my oil let me double check to make sure my pan is hot uh i want it to be about 365 and uh and then i'm going to saute my beef i wanted to show you by the way you see i got everything ready yeah i got everything ready uh meaning that my mison plus is ready everything is chopped and ready to go i just have a few more things and the things that i i haven't done is because i want to show you how to do it all right so first we're gonna saute the onion we're gonna caramelize them the onion is always number one always the onion is always number one that means it's always the first ingredient you put in okay i don't care if you got a pearl on you if you got chipolini onion if you got a right over on your guy you want to caramelize them right so now this is the the beef then we're going to use this is a chuck roast uh i i i find that chuck roast makes the bees do the best stew we're going to really really really caramelize them so they look real pretty okay not only they look pretty but we're creating this mala reaction where we have some caramelization on the protein it's very important friends really really important so salt and pepper don't be afraid to put salt and pepper right and um and we're gonna put them in there and don't touch them leave them alone let them get golden brown okay same deal with the onion leave them alone let them do their thing right i got everything ready you're going to love this recipe it's um i got port wine in the in this recipe i'm going to apply the wine in this recipe then i got mushrooms and i got a bunch of vegetables also but i'm going to put the vegetables toward the end remember when you do this you heard the expression it says put the beef in the pan without crowding right without clouding that means don't don't do this don't put them on top of each other otherwise the moisture of this guy is going to go to this one is going to go to this one and we're going to stew and if we stew we don't get this caramelization right there you see it see what i'm talking about right there that's what i want right there that carmelization okay so look that's why you don't touch it you put them in leave them alone no no no different than if i took a new york strip or a filet mignon and i'm cooking it in the pan i put in the pan i live alone all right leave it alone so it has an opportunity to caramelize right the onion are going to start caramelizing your beef is right here i got some mushrooms in here friends then we're going to use and uh and and you know what i like to do is when i eat a mushroom and i do not slice them i cut them in quarters if they're too big i cut them in eight or six so they stay nice you see what i mean you don't slice them like i said if they're very big cut them in six okay if they're small just cover them in quarters it doesn't really matter but you want you don't want to slice them okay see look cut them in sixes all right so we got a mushroom ready to go and now let me see let me see how we're doing here okay one more thing mushrooms what a mushroom made out of if you took my class in my school you know what i'm where i'm going right mushrooms are made out of what water 90 water what does water taste like nothing so you want to keep your water in there that's up to you i'm not interested i don't want an ingredient and there's like nothing in my food okay look can you get that you see how nice that is folks all right so the beef is down okay all we did let me just push this spot over there i like this burner better all right so now now friends now friends we're gonna get rid of the water in the mushroom okay anything with water i don't understand people adding water to their food okay if i'm gonna add a liquid to my food or see like this pan though by the way look look look look at this man right there folks see why that that pan right there i got a little camera in here it's it's full of grease from the meat that pan right there has got some beautiful uh burnt bits right there so you know what i do after i'm done with it i take my port wine and i deglaze the pan yeah yes siree take that pan right there and you can deglaze it you see and then we'll take this and we'll pour it in there all right so yeah we don't want to lose an opportunity for flavor you know to me cooking is like building a building a first story you don't put a second story until the first one is ready right and you don't put the third one until the second one is ready right okay same deal so now look look look i got the mushroom in there cooking and the mushrooms are going to be releasing their water what would help them get rid of the water put it down there let's see how many of you know that what would have me get rid of the water on the mushroom anybody know salt yessiree salt right there right here i got this beautiful mediterranean sea salt that i'm going to put on there that's going to help me draw the water out of the mushroom that water the enemy the water is uh is not going you know what i find interesting you're probably with me too with this one when somebody uses dry mushroom you know they use this beautiful dry mushroom what's the first thing they do before they use the dry mushroom then put them back in the water what is wrong with you people okay if you have a dry mushroom you don't want to rehydrate it in water water tastes like nothing put it in wine put it in broth put it in stock put it in something else then water how great is that if you picked wine and let's say you pick the mushroom and inside the mushroom there's madeira wine oh you can't buy those but if you buy a dry mushroom and you rehydrate them in madeira you got a madeira mushroom well that'll be it something i should do what do you think of that idea let me know in your comment okay now if you could be here right now you would smell who's hot you would smell onion and mushrooms that are releasing their water now what's gonna happen when they release their water friends they become nice and small and that's okay i don't need the water have you ever chew on a canned mushroom don't do it don't ever chew on a canned mushroom that'll give you a nightmare okay you think i'm kidding no i'm not kidding i'm gonna put the garlic and as soon as you smell the garlic friends the second you smell the garlic which should be about right now we're gonna put our tomatoes oh anything liquid okay our tomatoes i got beautiful tomatoes and then you know i'm gonna put the pork wine that i got right there that i got from the pan and earlier at the beef in it right i'm putting it in there and i'm using the whole thing right there right all right so so far i got tomatoes port wine mushrooms fresh thyme fresh rosemary a little bit of tomato uh puree let me get a spoon a little bit of tomato puree all right we're gonna we're gonna bring up the heat this looks like it's slow down all of a sudden okay um oh oh oh i got tomato puree and you know what i got also is cherry tomatoes have you ever used cherry tomatoes or they're the fabulous cherry tomatoes are fabulous they give you a really really nice texture to begin with right nice texture cherry tomatoes look look but the problem is with the cherry tomato can they got a lot of water in there okay i don't know if you guys can see that but look at that they got a lot of water see look at this so i do it taking the water out of there look all right if i want to water i'll add some we're going to put a little more port wine you notice everything is carefully measured be careful then we're going to put the beef then we sauteed earlier all right so to save some time we're gonna mix all this up and then we're gonna put beef stock all right now i'll talk about beef stock in a second you want to put a beef stock okay all right now beef stock friends may be one of the ingredients that you don't necessarily have access to it you see not everybody's got access to a beef stock so what i do is we make our own beef stock of course because we have a commercial kitchen not exactly easy for people to make a beef look how beautiful that is look at this look how nice and thick that is folks look at this see how beautiful that is and the reason why it's beautiful like that is because when we make it we put tomato paste in it and we cook it for 24 hours so not exactly easy to do at home right oh my god are you going to make a beef stock you're going to cook 24 hours so see if you can find a shop then as a beautiful beef stock if not what do you do i'll tell you what you do oh you're starting to look good friends i'm telling you i'm coming back here more often the food is delicious uh let me tell you what you do friends you get yourself a um a um and you know we're gonna add to this we're gonna add some uh i got those baby potatoes look look look i got them cooked already i'm gonna finish them up look how cool they are little baby potatoes right little baby potatoes and and i got those uh baby brussels sprouts i already poached them and then i got those little baby carrots look at small though so i sauteed them i already poached them so they cook right so i'm going to saute them in butter i'm going to add them at the end because if i add them down they're going to fall apart this guy's going to cook this is going to cook for two and a half hours this is ground chuck you want it to really really really be uh tender you got to cook it for two and a half hours at a very very very low heat okay that's the secret okay so where was i oh oh yeah sometime i lose track of what i'm talking about and there's nobody here to remind me so uh to go back to the thing but i was talking about a beef stock so what do you do well you buy a good beef broth buy a good beef broth and and add some tomato paste to it if you have some extra leeks carrots celery and onion add it to it and cook it for a little while with a tomato paste and look it's going to give you a rich consistency like this and you can keep it in the freezer for 17 years approximately don't quote me now i can see people going 17 years we got that you know what we got with youtube we're good we're lucky we got recipe police i love it i got this thing where i do a recipe on well i'm i'm peeling a tomato tomato con case right i'm showing people how to make it american case i'm putting it on the water and i said it should take about 10 12 seconds you know how many of them i said oh it took 23 seconds it took 20. i'm glad they got a better clock than me now they got better things to do than oh my goodness he said 12 seconds 23 seconds what's wrong with him don't you have many things to do jesus christ anyway so look now let's talk about thickener a little bit you know i i like my beef to be able to i'm going to put it on more beef stock okay well why am i putting more you're wondering why what's the matter with them well because i like it to be some egg i like my beef to be also milk you see i submerge that's you know what i mean right some males like you submerged in it all right so now flour i could have put flour it was dry right dry beef and you put it on there a lot of people do that i think it's okay i got a much better trick though pay attention i'm going to teach you something you want to thicken something by the way when do you put the flower at the beginning or the end beginning or the end beginning at the end nobody knows yeah unless they've been to my class if you've been in my class you know beginning the flower goes in at the beginning of the dish not at the end of a dish if you put at the end of the dish it tastes like glue yeah glue you know when i was a kid we used to make stuff uh with flour and water glue them together we used to there was a glue for the stuff i glued 50 years ago is still glued up okay so when you eat raw flour it's in there and it takes a while to to get rid of it you know i always explain people thanksgiving dinner most people they take the dripping of the turkey right like that turkey fat crap and they add flour to it and they give it to their guests and what do they do after they eat the thanksgiving dinner they sit on a couch and they go i can't move i can't move i ate too much turkey there's not enough tryptophan in five turkey to put you to sleep it's the glue you just consumed okay you consume turkey fat and raw flour yeah good luck getting up the couch anyway so look i was going to show you a trick the flower okay look look look look look if you've been in my class before you're probably laughing right now because you know where i'm going but if you've never been to my class before you're going to wonder so i'm going to put the flower in here see how many of you reacted already you don't put it in here if you put it here well i have a huge mess right so pay attention look look you think of the strainer all right deck of the strainer put the flour in there taking the whisk right there right there ready ready look look look at this see you make a pace right there right and you bring it in you bring the stalk in okay bring the stalking don't be afraid to bring the stock in and look look look look look look look look you see what happened now now you got beef stock that is lightly thickened with this flour then we're gonna bring in because you don't remember let me just use the spatula right here we're going to put it in we're going to put it in you see see now let me tell you something friends when you have a soup a gravy a sauce then you want to thicken now remember you can't do that at the end now don't be doing that thanksgiving deal i was just telling you about don't be doing that not working so now look we'll go back and put a little bit more maybe i put just a little bit more stock on top of it i want to get rid of it all you see look and then we're going to mix it up now if at the end all right look see look no lumps none whatsoever it's an easy way to do it but you have to use the double mesh strainer very fine strainer right when you do this and you mix it up you see look now if at the end because the tomatoes are going to release more water you know we're not at the end right there you know so it's very possible then we need more flour because i didn't put that much flour at all okay it's very possible that we did more at the end we won't be able to add any more flour because it has to have time to cook so i could use i could fix the consistency with a little bit of cornstarch at the end but flour of course look if you're a professional cook you have a roux you have a cooked roux you can put that in there but most people don't have a cucu trust me i know that's what i do for a living i teach people okay this is my thing okay and i know i know that most of you don't have a cook roof at home so you need to thicken and and and and this is a perfect way to do it so we're going to let that cook very slowly bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop very slowly yeah not boo boo boo boo boop that's no good bloop bloop bloop very slowly right let it cook we don't cover it we just bring it to a boil the minute it's boiling you'll reduce you let it cook two two and a half three hours depends depends you meat you'll know when you take a you know how i do it i take a wooden spoon right there right and i go in and i take a piece of beef and i put on the side and if it if it start to fall apart then i'm gonna test it i know it's gonna be almost ready to go with seasoned salt and pepper toward the end and we're done and where'd it go let me tell you something this with the mashed potatoes oh all the vegetables are amazing mac extract because the frizz is beautiful i'll be back when it's cooked and we're going to serve it all right friends with two and a half hours went by it went so fast especially for you guys and uh and this is cooked and i want you to see the uh the thickness of the sauce you see it has to be covering the beef right so you you see look there's sauce on the beef it was too liquid it wouldn't be on the beef it's kind of like when i make a gravy for thanksgiving i want it to stick on top of the turkey same deer here you see the sauce is on top of it so what we're going to do we're going to plate it and um and all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take my my serving spoon and and i got myself a i love those big big plate big serving plate like this i mean we can certainly use the mashed potatoes and we're going to do a lot but i got those cool little vegetables then i did you know i did some baby brussels sprouts and and carrots and um so i'm gonna do this right there right and i got i sauteed um i sauteed some some baby carrots and and a brussels sprout and i sauteed them at the last minute they cooked right so we poached them already lay down and i just finished saute them in butter really quick you see just like that just it's really really simple just let's not go crazy here right just like that right and we got a couple of cuts in there nice right and then i got those uh baby potatoes i was telling you about so i cooked those separately i mean you can cook them inside if you want but there but you know what i find i i find that if you cook them inside they lose their colors and everything and they're not that attractive anymore but but they're delicious i mean it'd be the same right it'll be almost the same so just make sure your product is nice it's looking pretty we got we got mushrooms we got potatoes we got all that stuff right there you know the caramelized onion right there look at that oh yeah baby this is it oh yeah oh yeah here we go now look look look i put a little bit of uh uh chopped parsley in here oh yeah baby now that's friends that is a beef stew [Music] that would be very french for that that's for all of you and uh thinks i'm faking the french accent you have to be french to say that okay so god bless america i love it this is beautiful you guys got to make that beef stew that's an amazing dish and so simple to make remember you're gonna need a two and a half three hours to cook it very very slowly i use chuck roast use whatever makes you happy as long as it's nice and tender and this is beautiful now remember folks if you like this
