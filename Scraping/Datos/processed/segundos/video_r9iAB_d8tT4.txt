well hello there friends a special dish one of my favorite shepherd spy we made two servings we made an individual serving and we made this beautiful lasagna pan stay tuned i'm going to show you how to make it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell let's get cooking well let me show you how easy it is to make this recipe friends i have some beautiful short ribs so i gotta cut them up i'm gonna cut them up in little pieces and i'm gonna grind them myself i like them much better than buying meat already grounded so what i got to do is just turn my guy on and voila [Applause] this is dead my friend i'm going to do all this i'll be back when it's all grinded up and we're going to start the recipes i'll be back in a few minutes after i'm done because we don't want to hear that machine for the next few minutes i'll see you in a minute all right friends now that everything is ready let's get going i love making this i grew up on it my mom used to make it in french we call it so uh and i don't know where the shepherd's pies come from and i'm not gonna worry about telling you because i don't know hey you go online and you read it's like 17 different opinion away comes from so we don't care we just want to eat some good mashed potato and ground beef or ground pork or ground lamb however you want to make it it's good with me as long as you're happy i'm happy hey guys i got clarified butter you don't have to use clarified butter you can use a good cooking oil but clarify butter i don't have to worry about burning it and i love the flavor of butter so if you don't know how to make clarified butter friends there's a link down there in the video it says show more click on it and we'll have a link about how to make clarified butter okay and it's better than the milk protein has been removed like i said i got two two and a quarter pound of short ribs you can do ground beef you can do ground lamb you can do whatever you want uh the short rib are perfect they got the perfect amount of fat we're going to saute them here and get some malala reaction okay you could do everything in one pot i like to do it in two parts so it goes faster we got some diced onion we got some sliced portobello mushroom we got some diced carrots and and and then we got some tomatoes i got a can of 28 ounce tomato i use lava tomato crunch tomatoes i got about a quarter cup of tomato puree i got some thyme i got some rosemary and i got some garlic and i got some peas for those of you that don't like pea just don't put them in don't worry about it i'm not gonna be there you're gonna be just fine let's check to make sure we have a good 365 degrees we don't so you know what we're going to do we're going to wait for a second until we get there because uh i don't want to bore you to death with too many stories i got a little bit of beef stock here just in case we need it so we're going to wait a few seconds for the heat to be hotter because it's not hot enough so i wait you got to make sure you're hot you got to make sure you're hot for if it's not hot enough of a temperature it's not going to work so we're going to caramelize the onion right here you know the onion always number one huh oh my regular here it goes again no no no i'm just going to say it one time that's it always always number one in the onion and um and then the beef the beef the pork the lamb whatever it is you're using you got to make sure your pan is hot otherwise you're not going to create the mala maya reaction maya maya maya reaction what is my reaction it's a combination of protein right there folks we're going to get some extra flavor we want to get a golden brown okay i see too many recipes friends when people do this even when you both do a bolognese sauce you want to get some caramelization that's flavor it's called maya reaction we're going to use a garlic salt i got an amazing garlic salt this garlic salt is fantastic we're going to put it everywhere because we need a garlic salt we're going to put some coarse black pepper of course black pepper and let's put it here through the cauliflower right we're going to caramelize the onion so yeah i see too many people that do this recipe and and what happened is their meat is stewed stewed the meat it's kind of like you took a new york shrimp and and you're cooking in boiling water yeah yeah it'll cook you know what i mean right so we wanna get some color caramelization so we're gonna get this okay and then the onion same thing so this is going to take a few minutes before it happens so i'm not going to bowl you to death we're going to continue doing this when this is golden brown this guy's going to bump we'll come back and we'll put the whole thing together we're going to wait because we cannot rush this if we rush it we're not going to have any guys call it a nice collar when you make a bolognese sauce you got to do the same thing all right so we'll be back in a few minutes golden caramel and and go on brown meat all right friends it's taking a little long time for the uh for the meat to caramelize but it's okay we got a little time the onion of caramelized i'm not gonna put the mushrooms because i want the mushroom to release their water so we're going to do that we'll put the mushroom in there we're going to put it on salt and we're going to wait for that to happen so it's kind of like a um take your time kind of dish to make we want to make sure everything is cooked want to make sure that mushrooms are cooked takes a little while to cook want to make sure everything is done correctly the meat is not caramelized yet and i want to wait until it caramelizes before i put more ingredient in there i don't want to put more moisture if i put more moisture then i'll do it like everybody else does i'll stew the meat instead of getting the maya reaction which is so important remember it's very important so we're going to wait a few more minutes for this okay and then we'll continue adding more ingredients all right so we'll come back in a minute okay friends check out the meat you see we got some nice color in it and uh the flavor of it is amazing you see we got some nice color not big caramelization but good enough for us to continue cooking the recipe the mushrooms have released all of their water we are now going to put the carrots in here and continue cooking this until the carrots are tender until the cows are tender and right here my friends we're gonna add the tomatoes we're gonna add our tomatoes right here we're gonna add a tomato puree in here and we're gonna cook all this down we're gonna put some rosemary and thyme cook all this up let's check this it's a constant i mean to mix everything friends we want to constantly mix everything so you got to be there and doing it you got to really mix it this is like a a really important thing to do now is to mix everything we're going to let this cook slowly i'm going to put a little bit of flour just a little bit of flour and a little bit of stock friends so i'll show you i'm gonna put just a little bit of stock this is my beef stock you know big stock you can use beef broth uh i'm gonna put a little flour so i got a little bit of uh and i have a little nest right there we're gonna put it right quick just gently a little bit of flour on top mamma mia mama mia put everything on the side there we go just a little bit of flour we're going to mix all this up let the flour cook it's got to be uh this is going to dry up a little bit you see what a mess i made don't do like me and we're going to cook this up friends and this is going to take a few minutes to cook so the carrots and the mashed potatoes we already made some mashed potatoes and i already made the mashed potato friends well let this cook and we'll put just a little bit more flour very little this time i'll kick it i'll keep it in the on the uh there you go that's what i was trying to do the first time [Music] there you go friends and we're gonna gently cook this we're also going to gently cook this until the cows are tender and when the cows are tender let me tell you with the short ribs this is going to be amazing my friends it's beautiful we want to lose all moisture and that's exactly what we're going to do we're going to cook that slowly we'll be back in a few minutes and then you know we're going to add the peas right here and the peas i use frozen peas makes it easy frozen peas and we're going to cook all this up and we're going to blend all this together for a little more garlic salt because at this point i put so many ingredients there you go so we cook this gently until the cows are tender and then we're going to mix all this and we're going to put it all together so we'll be back when this is dryer and the carrots are tender be back in a few minutes friends i forgot to put the garlic you know i had to forget something it was right there okay we'll continue cooking we'll be back in a minute okay friends the meat has reduced it's very big so it's uh i'm putting it in two pans friends uh no a third pen mamma i'll tell you a dirty a little more panned than

potatoes and i keep it the same thing i keep it in there in a warm oven it's not gonna burn right and then i go right in there and then i put it on there and that what that does friends that makes a cleaner job you see so then you don't mess up the the bottom layer too much you see you don't mess up the meat too much like i did earlier it's a pastry bag it's a redisposable pastry bag it makes it

don't want to burn myself because i do that all the time so we're gonna let it rest then i'm gonna cut it and we're gonna have a piece together all right so let it rest a few minutes you remember if after 45 minutes it doesn't get you that golden brown color you don't turn on the blower and don't forget it how would that happen to me once in a while i will be back in a few minutes okay when it's cooled off so i don't want to burn myself okay friends we're gonna cut a slice because i'm hungry so the first slice never really looks so good i hate to cut a first slice in front of you guys but it
