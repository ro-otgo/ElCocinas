i just took this thing out of the oven look at this meatloaf it's got beef it's got vegan it's got pork it's got uh uh ham it's got the salami it's got a oh this is amazing if you could smell it you got to stay do you got to make this you see you guys are going to love it it's amazing remember if you like the channel we love you to subscribe don't forget to give us a thumbs up and don't forget to ring the bell so you get the new video stay tuned i will show you how to make this amazing okay friends this is my favorite meatloaf and my famous meatloaf i should say when i was in a restaurant business in 1976 yeah that's a long time ago some of you were not even born i had a restaurant in fort lauderdale called the left bank and we were open for lunch and on thursday we had meatloaf i'll never forget we would open up a door at 11 30 11 15 they were outside waiting to get in because by 11 35 the restaurant was full everybody wanted meatloaf that's the meatloaf so i'm going to show you how to make it it's really really simple okay we got veal we got pork and i use a pork loin and i use a v loin and we have chuck roast and um and i grinded myself now you're gonna say ah can i buy buy whatever you want to buy but trust me you want to educate yourself go on the internet and watch how ground meat is produced in uh anywhere in the world it's pretty scary stuff so i'd rather do it myself at least i know what it is you can get a pork shoulder you can get a pork loin whatever it makes you happy my favorite part of the beef is um is chuck roast but get whatever you want and uh and you can control the fat a lot of people like a lot of fat you know i don't really care for a lot of fats matter of fact um if i'm gonna have fat i like that i like it i like it to be olive oil i like it to be a butter i love butter right and uh but but this uh this animal fat things i mean unless i'm buying a new york strip and i got beautiful prime meats you know a meat grinder like this folks it's a hundred bucks some of them are even cheaper than that you can buy a good manual one my grandmother had this beautiful manual one that was fabulous put on a counter it's not like he's gonna use it every day because you're 30 dollars all right so believe me if you have a kitchenaid attachment you can buy kitchenaid attachment for it this is beautiful you can make hamburger you can do so many things with ground beef so do whatever you want it's your stomach and at the end in order to clean up all this because you still got a lot of meat in there i like to put a piece of bread in there and since we're going to put bread in a meatloaf anyway some breading you put a piece of bread in there and watch what you watch which will happen it'll push it right out you see and when you see the bread coming out you just stop that's all i mean you don't put the bread in there not gonna hurt it but you see look look you see right there it's starting to turn white see the bread is coming out all right so now we're good that's it mostly bread right there you see all right so this is bread we're done with this machine you see let me tell you friends try one time to do your own your own ground meat you won't believe it you you won't be buying no ground anything at the store anymore so you can do my mom would do uh a two time beef one time pork one time veal you can do equal amounts you can do whatever you want really okay it's really up to you so i got the beef in there going right i got my veal and they are going and i got my pork in here all right so i got three meat right there okay so everything is ready to go i got some beautiful ham in there i use a black forest ham cut in little cubes i got some salami de genoa a little salami in there i got some carrots cut in nice little dice okay i got some fresh thyme chopped parsley see everything is ready by the way what is that called mison plus when everything is chopped and diced and ready to go okay so we got this we got this we're gonna put some eggs in there i got about three four eggs i mixed them it's easier then we got a little bit of garlic we're gonna put some garlic in there i have my chopped garlic i made a video on how to do this it's just olive oil and garlic puree okay and garlic we're going to put a little bit of uh uh a breadcrumb this is fresh breadcrumb again we have a video for that i'll put a link in there so you see it a little bit of worcestershire sauce worcestershire sauce this is going to give us quite a bit of salt right the worcestershire sauce so before i forget let me put some salt and pepper in there and you notice everything is carefully measured folks as i said all the time it's not rocket science it's cooking okay um you could use some people use milk some people use yogurt i use buttermilk buttermilk gives you a really really really really nice flavor and then i got some onion then i just sauteed okay so sauteed onion you gotta slot it okay you can't just put raw onion in in in in a in the meatloaf okay because raw onion is never gonna cook now it's never gonna be calm if you could be here right now and smell those onions right there they're amazing they smell already fabulous a little bit of hot sauce certainly don't need to do that if you don't want to but i do so a little bit of hot sauce did i put a breadcrumb in there yet i put it over there you go now i hate when my doctor does that but we're gonna we're gonna massage this thing and then we're gonna put it in a beautiful mold wrapped with bacon let me tell you this is delicious and how bad could it be think about this right i got only good stuff in there right i mean i got good meats i got good good everything everything i have in here is is high quality so of course it's going to be good you know the problem is with a lot of meatloaf out there people don't meet love with crap with like crappy food it's just a meatloaf let me tell you something i love a good meal with the mashed potatoes the beautiful mushroom sauce you invite me in any time right as long as you use a good ingredient i don't care what you call it this is this is beautiful you can do so many cool things with this i'll tell you i like it i like it um hot of course but i also don't mind it cold mix it up really good all right you hear those people say don't mix it up you'll make it tough where did they get that information from you know i see so many information on youtube where do they get that information from some of the stuff they talk about i don't know where they get it from i'm telling you some of those ridiculous comments i hear on the internet and you know i've been a chef for 54 years i love it when somebody says to me oh that's not the right way to do it and guess what you do it the way you want to do it i'll do it the way i want to do after 54 years i know my way around the kitchen i love it when somebody says to me that's not the right way to do this yeah okay well you do it do you do it the way you like it here you go so now i think i'm done mixing i'm gonna go for a break no we're gonna do them all now let me put this aside now we're going to prepare the mold friends and this i do you i don't know if you've seen my chicken rotholo recipe but i have a a chicken rothory recipe where i do the same deal okay where i wrap it except it's made with chicken instead of being made with meat like that i make it's made with chicken all right so what we do is we line this whole thing right there friends it's the same deal i don't do it a different way there's no other ways to do it i mean yeah yes plenty of other ways to do it but this is the way i've been doing in my whole career okay i love this i learned to do this from a um shakati in france hey um that's one of the first job i had when i was probably like 12 years old you know in france they make you work a young boy let me tell you something you can play outside instead of that go work go make some money for the family we need the money so i was working at this uh it was a um so he did a lot of charcuterie and he did a lot of stuff himself a lot of prepared dishes and things and i always tell the story because it's always so funny to me but uh we were we were like five or six apprentices walking downstairs and the ladies of the neighborhood would say mushy are we what's in the sausage i knew we knew where was in the sausage it was anything that was left over at the end of the day that's put in a sausage mix that's why i don't eat sausage unless i make it myself so we should we would always say you should ask what's not in the sausage monsieur aren't we not what's in the sausage because everything in the sausage was crap god thank goodness i was only 12. so here we go friends look i think uh yeah i think i got to put another one right here all right so that's why you got to be careful where you buy your sausage okay so look now what we're going to do friends we're going to cover the ends right here you see on this one side okay you'll see it you see it when you see it you're going to love it this is really really really nice friends you watch let me make sure i got everything i need here got to push it aside right now on the other side i got to put something so i got this bacon right there then it's very a little thinner it's much much thinner so but i'm going to put some on the other side because i still got to do it so you see you buy the same ham and one package is beautiful and the other one is very very thin which really doesn't matter that much but what we're doing right here friends you see look you're going to love this recipe because you know i always say at the end of the day friends is you're only as good as the ingredient you put in the food you put good

i'm going to go here here here just follow how it falls you know so it comes out easy and don't worry if it's small on that side it really doesn't matter you'll see you'll see and i said well that's not going to cover you're right it's not going to cover but i got it covered i got it covered all right so look now check that out you know what sometimes i wonder about me i should have become a plumber maybe i would have been better at that what do you think friends look at this now we're talking ah you see you see what i'm talking about you see what i'm talking about no you haven't seen nothing yet unless you see my chicken rotoro then then you're seeing it make it wish chicken rotolo is fabulous same deal same deal same day acceptance chicken pack it in pack it in i love that stuff okay all right so now now i'm gonna flip it i'm gonna put it on a cookie sheet and we're gonna put it in the oven but first we're gonna make a glaze so let me go get a cookie sheet i gotta do that i know i got one right here i got one right here here you go right there all right so now now friends we're gonna flip it on the cookie sheets you ready all right you take it and boom don't miss like i just did okay try to put it straight if you can help it all right otherwise you're gonna mess it all up all right you ready slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly take it out totally slowly slowly here you go check it out oh yeah baby oh yeah baby check it out howdy i like those turkeys no turkey enough how do you like this huh is that a meatloaf or is that a meatloaf friends i love it so now we're going to put a glaze on it so i tell you what i'll do because i got a mess in here let me clean up and get a little bit uh cleaned up in here and i'm gonna get a little pot because i don't know where my pot is and i'm gonna put it i'm gonna make a nice glaze so let me clean up i'll be right back okay friends we're going to put a glaze now i'm going to put um clean up the whole plate it was a mess a little bit of brown sugar uh that's going to give us a nice little sweetness on the outside i got ketchup in there put a little bit of worcestershire sauce i'm going to use a um a balsamic vinegar i have this apricot balsamic vinegar that is amazing it's a white balsamic vinegar apricot is really really special and a touch of hot sauce so we're going to give a little bit of heat to this glaze then we're going to put on the outside but very very little right then we're going to take a brush and we're going to brush this on the uh on the on the uh the meatloaf we're gonna brush it on you can skip it you know you can just put it in the oven like that it'll be delicious okay with or without the glaze the glaze gives it a well you know you know your glaze gives it a really really special um crust on the outside that it's kind of sweet so what i do is i just brush it on and and you want to be like generous okay when you do this you want to be generous and you may even put some of it toward the end when it comes out of the oven you can do that it's not like you need to cook it you know what i mean i mean i'm cooking it because i really wanted to uh to caramelize you know and we're going to put it on there you just brush it on like you would just brush things like you would just brush things like you're brushing things and say what is he talking about like your brush you know like you do some painting hey by the way the brush i'm using friends is a silicone washer i don't use the brush to get a home depot those are for painting they're not for glazing a meatloaf all right friends see look look don't be afraid to be generous with this okay be generous with this see i like when it goes in the groove you see look at this friends look at this yes i love it when it goes in put a little bit more don't be shy and you put it everywhere it smells delicious it's you know i don't use ketchup often but to make a glaze or to make a cocktail sauce there's certain product you gotta use ketchup it's just not the same without it it just has a little magic to it and uh i really think it's uh it makes this crust on the outside like you really want to eat it you know you really want to eat it make sure it's pretty you know there's no reason to splatter down not carefully you want it to be as pretty as you can i like to be nice and even you see well that reminds me of my restaurant it's like a couple of years ago it was in 1976. imagine that imagine that i had bought a restaurant and it was a fondue restaurant it was called zeni's anybody lived in fort lauderdale that long uh you know your family remember it and then i turned it to open up the left bank restaurant in 1976 wow that's a long time ago all right here you go friends look at this what do you think wow i hope you like it just as much as i do we're going to put it in the oven i'm going to put some cracked black pepper on top of this okay really really really really dark i got some cracked black pepper than a really coarse very very dark he's very black very very black very coarse you see put it on top don't be afraid you see and this is going to be kind of cool when you get a one of those uh peppercorn you can put some fresh thyme in there i do that with a chicken rotolo i put some fresh thyme on it that's it friends we're just going to take this maybe i'll put a black pepper on the side of it what do you think yeah yeah put a little bit on the side right there you see and then we're just going to bake it okay let me tell you this is the meatloaf you want to try to do we're going to pop it in the oven at about four and a quarter and we're gonna cook it until we have an internal temperature about 145. it's a little more cooked but we got pork in there we got it so we got to reach 145 150. 145. i like it to be pink i don't like it to be all well done you know pink and that's what the ham and the salami is going to give us those nice little chunk that i'm going to be nice and pink all right so we'll come back when it's out of the oven and we look at it okay it smells amazing in here folks it's been about an hour and a half i would say uh now 45 minutes and look at this look at this look at this oh baby that's what i'm talking about right there friends check this out oh yeah oh yeah if you could be here and smell this friends this is what i call meatloaf friends
