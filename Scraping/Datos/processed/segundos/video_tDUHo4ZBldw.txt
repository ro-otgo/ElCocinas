well hello there friends stay tuned I'm gonna show you how to roast the perfect leg of lamb amazing it smells amazing in here remember thumbs up if you liked the video subscribe to the channel and ring that Bell stay tuned friends we're doing it right now together [Applause] okay friends let me show you what we're gonna do with this beautiful uh leg of lamb I got it in the fridge I'm going to show you uh what to do in a minute first I'm gonna rub a little rub I'm gonna rub a rubber well I'm starting already I'm gonna rub a little uh parsley and Thyme and um and uh and and rosemary thyme parsley and and nuts I got a bunch of nuts you know I like to deal with no remember keep them in the freezer they're nuts no don't keep your nuts in a freezer they stay fresher otherwise they get all rinse it never happened to you you got to knock your left in in the in the cupboard and and you smell it it doesn't smell fresh anymore keep them in the freezer anyway friends very simple we're going to take a little bit of parsley fresh parsley you know I like the curly parsley use the Italian pasta I mean I use that also sometimes I just think it smells so much better okay it's an I send a old-fashioned thing we love the kerdipar city a little bit of garlic when I want to be too garlicky just a little bit of garlic I'm gonna put a bit of fresh Rosemary I chopped that up it's easier a little Thyme and uh and and then we're gonna put a little bit of pine nuts and a little bit of almonds put whatever nuts you want you don't have any nuts don't worry about it not that big of a deal we're gonna process this and then I'm gonna put some beautiful garlic olive oil that's all you know like I tell everybody relax it's only cooking okay it's not the end of the world you don't have to follow exactly what I did they put salt and pepper here they probably didn't do it because I probably forgot again see put a little bit of salt in there friends a little bit of pepper it'll be a perfect way to season it you see right there and let's process this well you know what's happening right here it's stuck on the side of it so you need to um to stop it put a little more oil I want a little more liquid you see and what happened is my food processor is so big then uh I should have probably grabbed a smaller food processor you see and make a little quicker paste it's fine I want it to be a little more liquid that's all kind of like a flavored olive oil if you will you see all right friends I'm gonna fix this I'm gonna probably put it in a smaller food processor it'll be a little more liquid I don't want to be because what happens is if I leave that whole garlic like that I put on the outside it's gonna burn so I want to get a little more liquid okay so that's probably what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to a um a smaller food processor and make a little more liquid and then I'll come back and we'll we'll show you I'm going to show you how to tie the leg perfectly very simple all right I'll be back in a minute okay friends you see look look look look how much uh liquid how much more liquid it is you see I want it to be a liquid because if it's too chunky it's gonna burn on there okay you'll see it's going to be beautiful so now this is a typical leg of lamb folks then you get at the store um I got it already and it was already all tied up but because uh my butcher shop which actually is Whole Food in on Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale they do an amazing job and uh and they are all beautiful tied up and I took it all out because I wanted to show you how to do it okay it's really not complicated because you your butcher shop may not do it you would think they'd do it but Christians they don't do at least you know how to do it it's no big deal you see right there this is a typical this is a about a five pound one uh bone-in and it's nice because we can Slice It Off the Bone it's kind of dramatic to put on the plate it looks pretty good but you see right there there's flap right there we gotta tie it we got a tie right here that's why they tied so it's it all Cooks in one like this you see and um and so I'm gonna show you how to do it okay it's not complicated you need a butcher twine and usually what I like to do is measure about three times three times and then cut it normally Cuts right there but this this thing doesn't cut it's my new color but color is at the lunch they don't cut all right so all right so here we go friends well first thing we're going to do is we're going to tie a knot right here just a simple little knot right there oh oh another thing that they did which is really cool friends you see they clean the bone right there normally all the meat are there they cleaned it and you don't have to do it and which is very nice they already did it for me but if they didn't do it you want to do that you want to take the meat that is attached to the Bone and you want to take a little knife and scrape it up and then take a towel and clean it up nice all right so you want to keep this nice so you remove this and what you're going to do we're gonna go in the back of it first friends okay so we're starting with the back right there right and we're gonna take a twine which is three three times right we're gonna decorate it and we're gonna go on one side you see on one side a meaning like there's two side right there we're gonna go on one of the side right and then we're gonna go in and then we'll go back on the other side and we go back in you see and now we have the perfect amount of twine then we need it all right so then we tie this guy right there I don't want to be too make it too complicated but that's something like you guys can do it it's not complicated you can take it again tie it right there but you don't really need it it's just like this is solid the idea like I said is to be sure there you go nice and not and let's keep it clean you see right see so we see right there friends not complicated right so now at this point you can also tie uh uh this way um it's not really gonna go anywhere so if you are not comfortable doing this then don't waste that much time doing it I like to do it at least in the middle you see right there in the middle so we're going to go in one time two time oh what do you think of that I ate too much Wheaties today one time two times I've never cracked my butcher twine before it's never happened to me before friends and wow this is the first time in life on television then I crack it so now at this point you go in this way look it's very simple okay you go in this way you go underneath look so far right you're following me right underneath right and then you you keep this straight right there like this straight you see then you grab it look it's not complicated you go underneath and you pull it you see and now all you got to do is make a knot to secure it not to secure that's it and I'm not going to pull too hard because this thing is uh is weak there you go that's it all right so now look now we got ourselves exactly what whole food did except they did it for you but just in case you go to the store doesn't do it you want to be able to do it yourself okay you know what I forgot my garlic cloves over here the small garlic cloves I'm going to put some garlic cloves in here they cut magically they arrived we have some magic assistant here friends what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna rub a little bit because I want some of the flavor to go inside so what I do is I poke a hole with a knife and I bury it in there now it's slivers they're small friends because if they're small they're not going to cook you see see look look I think I took the garlic cloves and I just poke it I just cut it in very small slivers you see put as much or as little as you want here friends it's not going to hurt it now there's a little fat in there we're going to live a little bit of the fat now if you're gonna if people sometimes people don't like lamb is because they think it's gaming if there's one part of the Lamb it's gonna be gave me more than the rest of it is going to be the fat so the only fat really is on the other side it's not that much of a fat so we're not going to worry too much about it all right that's why I didn't clean it up too much they did a very good job this I tell you this butcher shop they do a great great job for whole food has uh has done a great great job at least in our town they do a beautiful job all right so friends right there we're ready to go now we're going to put our olive oil and uh and uh and Herb a little bit we're gonna put it on there you see and uh and this is it friends this this is it they were going to put this in the oven and then I'm going to put a thermometer now you know like for for beef same thing people have different uh temperature they like some like a rare some like a well done I don't really really like my lamb too rare medium medium rare maybe but not rare I don't eat lamb rare but that's a matter of opinion you either however you want yes and don't let somebody tell you it should be one way or should be any other you know what it should be should be your way they don't like it they can go eat somewhere else okay and what I remember when I was in a restaurant business people would say to me you're not gonna like me because someone might make well done I said I love you don't worry who am I the judge how are you like you meet you eat it however you want friends okay there's nobody that should tell you you should eat it one way or you should eat or the other you eat however it makes you happy all right so here we go friends we're gonna roast this guy so and then we're gonna go in the oven I got the oven at 375. so 75 is good we don't want to be too high so 375 is perfect for this and 375 works for so many recipes one day doing a recipe and and you don't know what temperature to put it in chicken Cooks perfect at 375. fish beautiful at 375 most fish 375 it's a great temperature it's not too hot it's hot and a half to cook and it does quite a quite a nice job what a mess I made that's okay you know I'm pretty impressed because I didn't make too much of a mess on my hands yet so here we go let's see I'm good on this side I'm good on the other side it smells amazing all right so now you know I like to put a thermometer on it so then I know what temperature it is on the inside I like to use this feature right here this thermometer yeah I do it for a primary but I do it for that you got this thing here this remote thing you put this on top of the oven right there which oven do I got I got the upper oven okay so we go we go right here or put it we can put it here right and then I'm gonna put this that what what I think is going to be the deepest part of the meat then it's going to be about right here we're gonna go in we don't want to touch a bone if you feel a bone then take it out of there right when I put it in here and we're going to take it out when it's about 125 130. um and that's going to be a right temperature probably 135 up to 135 so it depends how you like it you like it more cooked we're going to leave it in there longer we're going to put it in the oven now I'm gonna clean up all this and then uh I'll let you know the exact time how long it was the exact way I'll put all this on my uh on my recipe below below the the video there's a recipe when you click on show more it's very simple way to prepare it and uh it's going to be amazing so I'll come back when it's ready to go okay friends it took about an hour and a half so um but it's up to you how you want to cook okay some of you may like a more rare some of you may like a more well done so now this is the opposite side right there and all I gotta do is I gotta cut my twine I can't forget to cut the twine because it's not so good so we're gonna cut it right there release it to release it here release it here and now we have to do is release the two then we put in the middle because we just released the top right so now if we release this one we release this one we push it in we push it in we push this one in and we should have all of our twine in Two Shots well maybe three we're probably going to lose a little bit of the uh of the the paste but it's perfectly fine you can't just keep it on top of the twine underneath the twine so at this point friends we took it out of the oven um I took it out of the oven about 20 minutes ago take it out as early or as soon as you want but you got to let it rest a little bit friends just a little bit okay just let it rest this little bit now I don't know about you friends but I like my lamb very very very very very thin I don't like it to be a thick so I cut it very very very thin okay you see right there friends look at this look how beautiful that is hey you come back over here look how beautiful that is friends and it's like absolutely gorgeous look at this you see cut it thin now it's more delicate put it on a sandwich you put it on on a plate with roasted potato roasted vegetables look at this ones look how gorgeous that is it's gonna be so amazing so tender look at that it cuts like butter it cuts like butter to me this is cooked the Perfection here friends cook it however you want about I promise you this right there my friends it's perfect this is absolutely gorgeous dig a little bit in a pesto um it's beautiful absolutely gorgeous keep going until you got that down to the bone and friends this is not difficult to do I hope you make it remember
