well hello there friends fantastic recipe today i'm making a film menu with a fig and marsala sauce delicious i'm gonna show you exactly how to make it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel then ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it together right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] well hello there friends let me show you how easy it is to prepare this wonderful beer this is like a um no reverse here technique this is just a hey i just got it out of the store today you could have a filet mignon or you could have a new york sweep or uh whatever steaks makes you happy my friend okay this is uh two filet mignon that i got at the store and all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna season them pepper them pop them in a pan and pop them in the oven really really simple nothing special now if you have the time friends you can put the salt on it as much as the day ahead put it on a rack and let it um and uh and and soak it with salt i mean soak it season it we sold overnight if you have the time great if you don't have the time then don't worry about it every so often we don't have the time and if we want to do a reverse here we released a video uh the week of valentine chateaubriand tells you exactly how to do it or the prime rib review also tells you exactly how to do it okay so you're more than welcome to watch those we're putting a little clarified butter in the pan so it won't burn if i put regular butter the milk protein will burn in there and uh and obviously that's not what we want so we want to make sure the clarified batter is hot and we're looking for 365 degrees and i got it right there friends so i'm going to go and just give it a nice ear we're going to give it a nice seal on both sides and then i'm going to pop it in the oven okay this is going to have the little gray line on the outside the only way to avoid that is to do the reversing okay so now we're going to make a sauce to go with this friends very simple sauce i'm gonna use some butter that's my favorite part of my job oh hey you come back over here and i'm using my reduction saucepan which really really makes a really oh mama me i haven't drink anything i promise you and um so i got let's lower the heat i'm going to put a little shallots in there and i'm going to make a a very simple sauce my friends and we're saving a little shower because i'm going to put some uh asparagus i'm going to make a uh a really simple uh fig a dry fig you want to use dry pig for this because wet fig will bring him too much water if you get them at the grocery store chop little figs let's see how we're doing here let's do you know look it's not releasing itself so wait just give it a second don't touch it for a few minutes eh um fig and you know i love tarragon you don't have targon you can use thyme you can use rosemary you can use sage use whatever makes you happy right and then we're gonna put some masala wine in there believe it or not friends look okay now releasing yeah mean it's not ready if it's not releasing yet then it's not ready to go all right a little fig shallots you can put garlic if you want but it's too elegant for the sauce i'm gonna see it releases perfectly and we're going to wait just a little small second we're going to put on the other side we're going to give it a quick little seal to get a nice color in there now if you don't have clarified butterflies use a good cooking oil it looks like an avocado oil a high temperature oil vegetable oil use whatever oil makes you happy okay i don't want to be too uh controversial look at it see nice very simple we're gonna do we're gonna turn it around in the meantime you know it's a fig so i'm going to use my fake vinegar you don't have a fake vinegar then don't worry about it don't put it in you don't have it you don't have it if you have if you if you never tried it you should try a 18 year old fig vinegar frank it's amazing okay this one is 18 years old it's already reduced it doesn't have much acidity so i don't need to have to let it reduce so put a little wine in there and i'm using a masala wine you can use a madeira one you can use a port wine you know those are my favorite wine to use all right and then we're going to see how we're doing over there yes now we're going to roll it around give it a nice sear all the way around it now there's no way friends you can cook this in a pan the whole time it's too thick you see you want to cook it in the pan the whole time you have to cook it in medaille so it'll be about half the size of this and that cooks really really really fast if you want to do that there's nothing wrong with that either you know it's a quick uh medallion of filet mignon sauteed it goes really fast okay this is very simple right all right we're not gonna take it and we're gonna pop it in a preheated oven at 425 degrees my friend right there go in the oven goodbye let's not worry about it you know what i'm gonna do friends i am going to move my asparagus right here so i'm going to do the asparagus right here and asparagus all i did friends is uh let me put some butter every time i use butter i love it i love my job period i have a fun job i love to cook i'm retired and now i'm cooking for you guys it's really cool okay so look guys masala wine does not need to be reduced so we're not going to reduce it very much all right we're going to put a little bit of broth for those of you that have been following my recipes my channel you have made a beef broth i know you have made some kind of a beef broth i'm going to be stuck if not friends there's video on our channel i want you to see them 40 asparagus we saute a little bit of shallots and we're going to put our sun dried tomato if you got them you don't have them don't worry about it okay remember this is cooking not rocket science so we're not trying to impress anybody we just want to cook a quick little steak dinner all right so look the asparagus my friends what do you do with asparagus you must rehydrate them in water cook them in water first and then we put them you do that with all the vegetables friends all the vegetables to make sure everything is okay yeah um all the vegetables friends okay uh they they do you poach them in boiling water then you put them in ice water you do that with green beans matter of fact there's a video on how to do the green beans on the website right over there it should be a link and you go and check it out okay you do the same thing with the green beans you do the same thing with asparagus you see i cut them and i cook them really really simple right a little salt and pepper in there let's put some crushed black pepper we like it it looks good right a little salt right and then we're going to saute the asparagus in butter i mean look at this a child could do this now how do we cook the asparagus you know i showed you that in a few videos but if you have never seen it before a lot of people tell you to break the asparagus please don't do that we're going to break it here here here here where don't break it you don't need to break it cut it in a bias because you know it's dry as a bone right here you need to rehydrate it so it's nice when you cook it right you can't just cook it like this you see people putting raw asparagus on the grill don't do that look first you want to peel it how do you peel asparagus hello you take a vegetable peeler you see it's very fancy here you don't need to peel the top the reason why we don't eat the bottom usually friends is because it's too much fiber and we don't like the fibers right so what we do we take it and we cut it in a bias you see look right there and let me tell you something then you poach him start with this for a few minutes before and then you go you put this if you put them at the same time this is going to be overcooked by the way this is a nice and fresh asparagus you see when the buds are really close like that nice and fresh they get old they get all wrinkly and it opens no good all right so we finished cooking that letter friends we're going to finish the um the filet we're going to let it cook a few minutes and then we'll come back we'll plate it very simple the sauce we're going to finish it together we're going to let it cook a little bit get the shallots to get some flavor of it maybe 10 minutes 5 minutes we're going to take the filet we're going to let them rest and we're gonna make a nice presentation i'll be back in a few minutes okay okay friends it's been about almost 10 minutes and we'll take it out of the oven take it out it's hot it's supposed to be hot that's good we like it when it's hot so what i'm gonna do friends i'm gonna take them out they're beautiful see look at that gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so they're not really big you know six and a half ounces eight ounces you know this is uh yeah it's this one is about seven ounces actually they are seven ounces so the clarified butter you have in here friends it's kind of burn at this point you know and i don't really like it but what i like is the font in there that i'm going to use for the sauce you see all of this all of that goodies right there friends i'm going to use all that goodies right there because we all know this is like liquid gold print okay so even if it's a quick unit this is liquid gold okay and we want it we want it we do want a period period page so we're going to take it we're going to deglaze this pan it's going to be a lot better to wash too we got all that stuff and right there now remember if you're using a red wine you gotta let it reduce but a masala wine or a pork wine or a madeira wine you don't need to let it reduce okay so now what do we got well we got a sauce that is looking pretty good and the sauce is looking very good already but it's too thin so you can let her get it reduced to the right consistency but if you let her reduce you lose half of it right so since it is good already since it is good already all right let's check it and see [Music] delicious panini salt and pepper so here we go all right salt and pepper so like i said yeah if you let it reduce now friends yeah it'll reduce but your reduce you'll have nothing less so what i like to do is i like to bring up the consistency with a little bit of cornstarch that's all just a little bit of cornstarch voila very simple and you put just a little bit of cornstarch be careful a little bit of cornstarch my friend you see don't be using a lot now sometime we have tendency of using too much just a little bit goes a long way changes the consistency okay now all the flavor is there oh by the way i i had a dinner party last night and i made some extra potato i saved them those potato right there the foam dump potato i got right here there's a video on that i made a video i already released it somewhere in there okay then a portabella mushroom i love to serve portobello mushroom with a dinner like this and i show you how to prepare the portobello mushroom in a portobello mushroom video that i released a year ago over there you got to check it out friends it's really good and you can serve it with it you don't have to serve it with a portabella bathroom just everybody's whatever you want right but it's really cool okay i have them i want to show you how to do it you should try it this is going to make a really beautiful plate uh where was i going oh i know what i was going i was going to go i wanna strain this i wanna strain this i wanna strain now you know you're gonna say oh mama mia look at how many pot this guy's dirtying he's dirtying too many pots here we go well we got plenty of pots so those are not just garnish okay i use them and i'm going to strain the sauce so it's much more beautiful okay now you know there's a lot of sauce recipes on my channel and this basic technique because it's easy when this is the basic technique okay this basic technique technique right there is uh is a is a classic technique okay it's the way you use it because there's no other way around you want to extract the flavors let me tell you something the fig and all that this is going to be amazing okay look look look at this okay here we go let's put it here i have a mess so how do we serve this first let's look at the sauce let's look at the sauce you see let's look at the sauce look at this folks what it's missing it's a little thin right it's a little thin little thin let's see oh oh my god oh i'm telling you this is the sauce for the god yeah i'm telling you it's amazing we're gonna put a little butter also at the end okay we're gonna wait so the portobello mushroom how do we serve this place let me get a plate here we go i got a plate how do we serve these friends how do we serve this first we're going to let it rest a little bit more so i don't do i don't use any of the juice actually it's the butter that i got in there because i didn't have any juices i didn't cut it on there you see there's a little bit of the butter in here let me dry it up a little bit because i don't want that butter to be in our on our plate you see all right so we got it right there and uh yeah because it's not been cut into it yes so all right potable mushroom you can do the portobello mushroom plain you can put it in the bottom of the plate or i'll show you a little trick okay then we used to do in a restaurant you measure your filament y'all may get a towel to reduce this really quick i don't want to make the video too long but it's pretty cool right so you measure your filament and you figure with a cookie cutter what do you got here that's about the right size that's the better size right so you go like this right that's if you really want to make it fancy okay you certainly don't have to do this but if you want to make it fancy you're taking your your portabella mushroom and you make it the size of your filet mignon you see yeah you i didn't cut it mama there you go come over here yeah i'll show you how to see look look you go like this you take it you fill the menu right there like this you see what i'm talking about now now we thought now we're talking right all right so there's oh the potatoes i got them so we're going to put a potato in there yeah we're going to put it in asparagus now you can skip all this it's just extra stuff that i give you friends because it makes it a complete dinner okay but you certainly can skip a couple of those things right put whatever you want on here on that plate right there it's beautiful right just like this and then let's butter the sauce let's butter the sauce friends that's the best part oh yeah butter the sauce right there don't turn the heat off remember the minute you butter the sauce you want to turn the heat off so then the sauce uh the butter does not separate friends i think we're going to go with two potatoes i got them right there two potatoes and then we're going to put the sauce now you can put the sauce right on top of it or you can leave the sauce on the side it's really up to you my friends it's really really up to you you see put it on the top and i put it on the top it's it's a gorgeous look at this look at these friends look how beautiful that is is that a picture on its own right there friends put as much of the sauce rub some on your body let me tell you just wait until it's not so hot okay look i made i put it the the tower going there right the targo was i keep it in water so it stays nice right put a little sprinkle and look at this my friend bon
