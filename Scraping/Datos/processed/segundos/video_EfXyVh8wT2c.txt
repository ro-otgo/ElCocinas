today we're going to show you a really amazing slow-cooked beef cheeks recipe so soft then it falls apart with just a touch of a fork so this is what you need onion you can use any color you up a carrot you actually do me two celery stalks I don't have but okay I like celery for clip four cloves garlic I'm using three beef cheeks because they're fairly big but you can like use six small ones or big ones I guess kind of depends on how many so they'll probably eat this and all all right so first thing do is this my carrot shave it on down you're just gonna dice it up for me I like to usually cut it in half and then in half again I can do more fine dice I like my great uncle so there is the carrot done next we're going to dice up the onion I have few tricks up now I do this first you gotta peel the skin off so what I do is cut the onion in half like this then you push down on the top like that if you prefer and cut a few just fight those alone like that find one more and then you do wipe away those tears it'll all be worth all be worth it in the end next thing you gotta do is just check your beep cheek like you want to cut off any like really fatty bits I mean leave some of it but um you know what too much fat I like to cut off anything that's going to like feel really top in your mouth so like if anything feels really gritty this is a really hard fit you want to make sure your knife is really sharp when you're cutting into me because you don't want to like chop it up and make it this that I'm using is grab you that's why it's so marbled like that I'm just you know feel around if there's anything that feels extra tough cut it right off a lot of people don't do this and you really should so we have to see your offer meet but I'm going to do that you really want to make sure you're it's nice and dry so get a paper towel and just like dry off each of the needs so that when you stick the salt on it and you sear it off it doesn't have any of that water or liquid on it and you can get really nice sear but this is an important step when you're cooking anything that you're going to sear off in the pan so if you're making a nice steak for dinner make sure you just pat down your meat with paper towel and get off some excess liquid that way that nice crispy outside and really tender meat in the middle now when you're seasoning you want to make sure that you coat each side of your meat with plenty of salt and pepper what I like to do is spread it on like this and then Pat it in to make sure the salt is getting right into the meat away when you sear it doesn't fall off so what you're going to do is just see your bowl slides of the night when you're scaring me want to make sure that your temperature on your burner is up high that way right when you put your meat in the pan it starts to sizzle the other thing to note is to make sure you do not crowd your pan because then your meat is not going to get a nice even sear see that nice bit of crispy Brown sear that is beautiful that's what we want to see also remember when you're searing off any kind of meat they do tend to shrink so whatever you start off with originally it's not going to be what you end up with that's a nice here we'll pull these out get ready to saute our pennies now we're going to come back over to the pan which I've taken off the heat added some olive oil to my pan is really hot so I didn't want to burn my veggies when I was putting it in I'm just going to stir these around make sure we can get to nice and mixed in with the olive oil oops there goes an onion flying up into the great beyond now I'm using a garlic press for my garlic because I don't like to take the time to chop it up so here I go I don't like to put it directly on the pan so sometimes I like to make a little bit of vegetable so that I don't burn small bits of garlic when I'm putting it in and then I'm going to stir it up and it'll all get incorporated you know it's ready when you get that nice smell of garlic and your onions are translucent and soft so we're going to turn our burner down so we're going to add some wine to this but first what we do is we're bringing our maybe mentally over to the slow cooker putting it on there and then we're going to bring our meat over and stick it on top of I'm just going to lay our beef cheese on top look at that knife here the next thing we do is my favorite part the one now this recipe because it's going to be the slow cooker needs kind of a punchy like full big red wine so like caps off we're low would work glue white caps having this also that's what I'm using some yellowtail doesn't need to be that nice of wine like I wouldn't use more than $20 bottle do this anyway so you're going to do two cups of red wine now we're going to bring that delicious red wine over to the pan try not to take a sip when you're walking over I know it's tempting but it is 2:30 in the morning for me make sure you scrape down the bottom of your pan so you're getting all those that's absurd meat and vegetables off the bottom giving it that extra bit of flavor then we're going to bring it up to high heat and make it to simmer get the bubbles so after you let it simmer for about a minute take it off the heat bring it over and give your me a nice line back get in my belly next you're going to add just the remaining ingredients so this is enough of beef stock fish put that right on top does it need to be heated just to add more flavor then you're going to get these you can get fresh thyme so it's like your fresh thyme sprigs you could do like four or five sprigs of it I was not thinking ahead enough so I didn't get any fresh it's always better to use fresh but today we're dry so you're going to add a tablespoon and a half that's over half and then you're gonna if you have fresh bay leaves I would only add three because they're a little more potent but I'm using dried again so I'm going to add four because they're just a little less hope then fresh bay leaf so one two three now what I usually do for the crock pot is you have to tie on high and half the time on low it's really up to you like for this recipe can do 10 hours on low or eight hours on high but I can't do half and half so I'll do about eight hours but they for on high and then for low so then you just say slow cooker then check it in about nine hours I like to cut like I said come back in about four and then turn the temperature on so low and then I'm going to make some really nice creamy mashed potatoes on a stove and roast some asparagus in the oven make a really nice salty crispy asparagus that's about it all right now we're back about eight hours like I said I did at about four hours on high and four hours ago I checked my feet size beef cheek beef cheeks and they're really tender code when I pull them out now it's going to be really soft and then we're going to make gravy mmm see look at that like falling apart barely wants to stay together I'm so slow cookers they have a saute flesh here button find us not everyone does so if yours doesn't you'll just need to do this in a sauce pan on a stove what I'm doing is getting an immersion blender like a stick blender and I'm going to puree the crazy in the drip tonight sides are crispy roasted asparagus in the oven and mashed potatoes but first you want to check your gravy and if it's not at the right consistency and it's not thick enough add a little bit of cornstarch and kind of make it whatever consistency you like your gravy to be as for my mashed potatoes I like to add some sour cream and milk and really blend them well coz I like my potatoes really smooth so I'm just using my immersion blender again to make them the consistency that I like I have made some mashed potatoes and some crispy asparagus in the oven and I'm going to get the plate together and it's gone beautiful thanks guys for watching this video I sure did enjoy eating it with my hubs if you try it yourself I would love to hear how you put in the comments below till next time this is Abbi I can't wait to eat with you again
