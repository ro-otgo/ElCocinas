hey guys welcome back I'm Shane Rene and today we're gonna go a little bit higher end I'm gonna do it I'm gonna be cooking a beef tenderloin I'm not gonna call it a chateau buddy your honor because I'm not really using the center almost but not quite so I'm using more of the butt end of it but you know regardless it is you know the Cadillac of the meat world so of the beef world anyway so what I'm gonna make is a beef tenderloin and I'm also going to accompany that with some with a red wine reduction pan sauce and we'll serve that with some some rosemary potatoes roasted rosemary potatoes so really good this is kind of a dish I would make if I was trying to like impress a lady friend or something like that so anyway let me show you how easy this is to do and let's get started okay so this is what we're gonna be using today over here I have some some some red potatoes that I quartered up and we're gonna be using some fresh rosemary with those I have some shallot here using shallot because you know this dish I think it goes best with this this is kind of a mix between flavor wise is kind of between our onion and garlic also we're gonna use some carrots salt and pepper some good olive oil some Merlot and some beef stock and of course the star of the show beef tenderloin when you're using a meat of you know this cut of meat quality you don't have to you know you don't want to cover it and all the kind of seasonings and stuff like that you all you want to use a salt and pepper and you know a nice sauce because why mask you just don't want to mass such a good flavored tenderloin you know such a good cut of meat so I you know I really dislike what people try to blacken or put a rub on a tenderloin it makes me cringe anyway let's go let's go over to the stove yeah so I got my pan heating up starting to smoke I got it on a little little tiny lower than medium-high not much more than that so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and put some oil in my pan so good olive oil not too much I'm gonna go ahead and season this beef make sure you get all sides this will help you know put a nice little crust on it like I said this is all you need to do with a tender long as far as seasoning so into the pan we go so we try to do is get a good sear on all sides I thought you mean see how quick that did that it started to brown a little bit that's from the salt and pepper I'm not gonna cut away from this only because I want you it doesn't take long and I want you to see the whole process about maybe 20 to 25 seconds maybe 30 seconds on each side you can see that one side is done that's pretty right that color this is what I would also do if I was making a beef wellington which I'll make at some point just a little bit you see that stuff sticking on the bottom at I want that I want all these were the particles in there this is all going to contribute to our flavor and our sauce on the skinny side they might just have to hold it a little bit you can use a probe with this dish I'd know how to touch it I can just squeeze it and sell it tell us how you know what's is where is that medium rare medium you know that kind of thing so this is all we want right here nice sear on this meat okay so now what we're gonna do is let that rest okay I'm just gonna kind of put this on the side let it rest and in the same pan we're gonna add our shallot and our carrot and let me tell you so does that hit that pan that smell was crazy crazy good so we just kind of stopped pissed off they did follow up shallots smells so good when they cook them especially in olive oil this is more like you know like I said before it's more of an up up with puppeteer dish you would take quite a bit of this in a restaurant some restaurants would charge about $30 that is just it's not a little bit more I'd have to say if I'm you know if I had to pick one thing I was the best at it's probably cooking me so now you see if you look you just see like it's starting to caramelize just a little bit you've been cooking for maybe four minutes three and a half minutes and that's what that's what I want to see this this sauce is gonna be dark and I want it kind of sweet so not too much but a little bit that carrots the carrots in here they get kind of sweet when you start caramelizing a little bit not to mention that it's just beautiful color I say it's been cooking for about five minutes no more than that so now we're gonna go in with some wine you can tell if somebody in a restaurant knows how to cook if you never hear that sizzle they're not cooking it you're not doing it right all right now we're gonna add some beef stock and I'm gonna go probably a little bit more than half of Japan cuz I'm gonna reduce this by like 75% okay this is gonna end up being all nice and caramely and all right so I'm gonna bring this up to a simmer and I'm gonna lower the heat once it's simmering till about medium-low and we're just gonna let this go and tell it till it reduces til about this much you know this high in the pan about 75% and then while we're doing that while that's simmering we're gonna go and get our potatoes ready all right so I strip the leaves off of the rosemary and this is about 4 or 5 sprigs I'm not gonna go real you know to too fine with this cuz this is fresh rosemary and it's really nice and fragrant alright ok so now what we do is we want to coat our potatoes with olive water I'm gonna hit it with some salt and pepper okay go in what's up with the rosemary okay now we want to do is toss this up real quick all right now that's done that's it on our potato that's pretty right all right so let me show you how we finish these up okay so I have my oven preheated to 425 you can go for 50 depending on how your oven cooks mine is a little hotter than it actually says I think so all we're gonna do you don't to grease this pan because you know the potatoes are greased already all right so it goes nice and spread out okay and now we're just gonna go into the oven these will take probably half hour they're not really that big so they shouldn't take all that long maybe a little less than a half hour but we'll check on them I like to check on stuff about half way it's a good bit of practice to keep you know about 15 minutes I'll come in on peak in the oven and look at them and see how they're doing all right guys you can see how our our sauce is nice up up to a nice little simmer you can see how our tenderloin is sitting over here looking pretty so now what I'm gonna do is turn down this heat to live off to about medium-low and you know every once in a while I'll just kind of come over and move it around this isn't gonna you know we're not skimming this or anything like that what we had in here is olive oil and tenderloin which is not fatty so I just want to tell you how good it smells a little little tip for the guys if you're making this dish and you're inviting the girl over wait till you get to this point okay because right now my kitchen smells nothing but rosemary red wine and beef beef stuff you know nice beef tenderloin smell it smells delicious put it that way all right so now is when we can kind of relax for a minute the potatoes are in our sauce is reducing our filet is chilling out over there so we got about you know 20 minutes to do whatever you want when this is about halfway and the potatoes are done we'll step back in and I'll show you you know how we continue all right guys so our potatoes are done they look beautiful nice little golden brown color yum yum yum oh lord I dropped one that one looks good too oh that's hot all right so this is our sauce what I'm gonna do now is turn it off it's just about where I want it so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit it with just a little more beef stock just to bring it up just a tad I'm gonna go ahead and add our meat to it and I'm gonna spoon a little bit of sauce on it all right [Music] so now I'm gonna turn to turn the oven down to 350 I'm gonna put this in the oven for I don't know it's really really rare right now obviously because it's just sear so this will take about 10-15 minutes I'm gonna check it like I said before if you're not comfortable with touch of meat you know to see where it's at I think they make those like mcdonald temperature things where you just push it in and it says like beef pork chicken or whatever I don't know I've never used one of those but for a nice medium-rare you wanted that about 135 or so but uh we're gonna put this in and I'll show you how it looks guys I just pulled it out of the oven and I'm gonna say it's ready it's gonna be a nice pink in medium in the middle paint look maybe a little bit on the medium-rare side so I'm gonna put this on my cutting board and I'm gonna let it rest for a minute before I slice it if you slice it right away your juice will be go at you know that your steak will go everywhere if the juice of your steak will go everywhere all right so let's finish up this sauce all right so now I'm gonna bring it back up to a simmer and we're gonna fortify it with some butter fortifying meaning just a fancy word for bring it together pretty much so we're just gonna let that simmer for about one you know two minutes all right looks like we're just about there yeah looks beautiful so I'm gonna turn to turn the heat off we're gonna go over let this relax for a minute and while this calms cools down for just a second and we're gonna go over it slice our beef all right guys with the sharp knife we're gonna just go in at an angle I'm gonna tell you just by touching this is gonna be a beautiful pink inside little probably a little bit more on the rare side on a medium rare side but tsunami a little bit more on the medium rare side I'm just gonna cut three big ones a beautiful huh we'll just turn that one around all right guys so now we're just gonna put a little bit of sauce on our on our plate it's not that nice shallot and carrot on there I'm just gonna kind of lay our fillet on top you go ahead and clean up our edges [Music] kind of put a little bit on our steak and then it is filet mignon with red wine reduction [Music] alright guys
