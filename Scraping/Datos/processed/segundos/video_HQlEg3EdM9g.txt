hello oh it is Michael branstein here with the food and Wildlife Channel and I'm here with the beautiful and today Eva is going to cook my mom's Hungarian chicken even though we're a Polish I grew up with this recipe since I was a little girl and was my favorite dish and when my mom was in the hospital my dad was working and I asked him what to do step by step and he gave me directions and it's the first dish I cooked even though I burned it but for about six seven years old it's not bad but today we'll give you a real version not burn tasty delicious and easy to follow directions and if you all like this Channel or like what you see please like And subscribe let's get into the recipe so the beautiful miss ever is going to tell us what the ingredients are for this recipe uh four chicken thighs and I marinated the chicken thighs overnight with salt pepper Hungarian paprika garlic and a little bit of fresh parsley so for the sauce we'll have onions uh pureed sauce tomato sauce it's about 16 ounces black pepper flour sour cream salt Hungarian paprika butter olive oil and some extra tomato paste as also we'll use some chicken broth and water [Music] so we have heated the pan and we'll add first We'll add our butter and we'll toast the batter a little bit to get a little extra flavor so a coat the pan with the butter and let it caramelize a little bit it will start smelling like low brown butter so I will give it a minute before we put our olive oil in it so we'll just basically we'll layer all the flavors and the of the dish one by one so the butter toasts really quickly so be careful not to burn it so I can already see the difference in the color and I'll give it another couple of seconds to work itself a little bit more check out okay so after the batter starts toasting a little bit then we'll add our olive oil it's about two tablespoons and then we'll start frying up our chicken on both sides and if you don't want skin you can take the skin off it won't really affect the flavor that much so this dish my mom used to make probably every other week it was really popular in our household and that's one of the first dishes I learned how to cook and I was only six years old from a necessity plus my mom was in the hospital having my youngest sister so now we'll wait until this chicken um gets a nice color on both sides and we'll come back to make the sauce so our chicken got nice golden brown and ready for us to move us to the top so we're gonna take it all out oh yeah oh it's beautiful that's a great color okay let's do this one that's some great color on that person okay so with the leftover oil we'll put some of our onion into the grease and we'll saute them a little bit uh until golden color look translucent so while our onion is frying we'll add a little bit of salt and pepper to layer the flavors again we don't want our food to be blend if you layer the um seasoning every time you make a dish it will come up come out all always they're very good and it will taste like something you made a day before or hours before because the seasoning has longer time to marry each other then to the other password are checking us so they have really nice um yellow color with a little bit of brown edges and that's exactly what you want it doesn't have to be all the way translucent okay so we're gonna move this here [Music] all right so now we'll remove this pen over here it will add the tomato sauce that was about 16 ounces okay and then we'll add a little bit of chicken broth about two cups and we'll put about two tablespoons of sweet paprika and that's a mild paprika or to taste what I really like all but more of fresh cracked black pepper a couple of bay leaves one or two depends on your liking I'm probably gonna just put one and now we'll cook this for about 35 to 40 minutes until the meat gets tender so we have mashed potatoes ready and our chicken oh wow this looks this smells amazing looks amazing let me check double check the flavor for Meats in the tank very good okay so this sauce if you can come closer I'm not sure if how close you can see this but it's kind of thick so it doesn't need the flour so if it doesn't need the flour it doesn't need the water um doesn't need the tomato paste that I thought it would need so it's actually pretty much done I just gonna add a little bit of sour cream so here in this bowl um I have two different things I have a little ladle for the sauce and the Whisk little whisk for the sour cream so we'll take our sour cream and put in the bigger bowl [Music] and then with the little Ladle I'll put the Whisk in here we'll just add a tiny bit of the hot sauce and we'll mix it it's called tempering so if you temper your sour cream like that when you add it to the sauce it won't curdle but if you want to make sure it doesn't curdle you can add a little bit of sour cream a little bit of flour I'm sorry to your sour cream so we're bringing it to warm and warmer temperature okay it's a little process but it's worth it and I'm gonna turn it off for a minute it's not boiling completely okay it's real nice and creamy it's nice pinkish orangey color like salmon color it's getting ready to be poured into the sauce I like to do it I like to temper it more because I really don't want this to get ruined at the end of the whole process I'll put more okay it's pretty getting pretty warm in my hand so I think it's safe to put it all in the pan with the chicken but we also want to do it slowly and mix it up really gently came out beautiful didn't curl became like a creamy nice and creamy simple tomato sauce and uh this sauce could actually you can add you can make up to eight pieces of chicken as you can see it made a lot of sauce we just had four of them because it's just Mike and I were empty nesters so we cook for two and not for the family okay so now I'm getting ready to play this actually I'll turn it on and cook it for a minute with the sour cream and for a minute or two to kind of bring it to a little simmer and after that we'll plate it and we'll talk about it well we're back and the Beautiful Mess ever plated this all up and we poured some wine to go with it and let's give it a go uh so I made this Hungarian chicken with a little bit of Dill mashed potatoes and some traditional polish cucumber salad so if you would like to know the recipe you can just make a comment below and we'll make a little show about the different little sides that we do in Poland with our main courses so today we also picked Silver Palm uh to go with this dish because it really stands out to the tomatoey sour cream part of the dish and I think it will pair very well let's try it all right you played it first very good did a great job I can taste the sour cream and the cucumbers and mashed potatoes to go with it let me try that too try it again on that side yep very good try loving this cucumber salad it's all goes together very polished dinner and um monthly polish flavor right here on the one plate so on that note until next time Cheers Cheers
