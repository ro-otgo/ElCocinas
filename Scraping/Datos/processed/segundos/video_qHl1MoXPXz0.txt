what a feast the ultimate fish and chips you're going to want to watch this one people well that is incredible for me they had a perfect chip i mean the fish is crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside just do a double triple check on the chips yeah fish and chips my national dish listen i couldn't do it justice before but now i'm gonna smash it out the park because we're gonna pay a lot of attention to the finer details of getting this right first up the perfect chip you make your chips we're mary's piper potatoes you got me don't choose another maris piper let's peel them i don't stress about getting all the peel off you could actually make these chips with leaving the peel on next up get them sliced up and dropped into some cold water now i don't worry about getting perfectly same sized chips but on the whole they're the same so there is a little bit of trim and that's fine [Music] now put the bowl under a running tap and let it run for three or four minutes just to get rid of all the starch get the water nice and clear again now get the chips into salted boiling water okay so you want your chips on a gentle tickle yeah you don't want them boiling really rapidly you just want them on a little tickle because we're going to boil them until they're almost falling apart and they're really fluffy i'm going to pull them out these look pretty gnarly right and they're actually really delicate straight out the hot water but they're perfect because those gnarly bits when they go into the high oil will become so crunchy and so crispy they will be the perfect chip so delicately on to your tray let them cool down and then we're going to whack them in the fridge so i did these yesterday and now they are absolutely perfect you want to have some time you want them to sit in that fridge for as long as possible so they become really quite firm again like that was a delicate chip when it went in yesterday but now it's holding together well we're gonna fry these in beef dripping okay so uh the lovely people at farm sent me some beautiful beef dripping which is what we're gonna fry your chips and your fish in so let's get it into our fryer and then we can start frying okay so i'm going to fry a couple off just to do a test fry to check that i've got the oil right okay now just come and have a look at these beauties now these are oh [Music] oh so crunchy but what they've got is they're nice and fluffy and soft on the inside but they're really crunchy on the outside oh mate oh can't stop eating them okay they are perfect let's get the rest into the fryer and then we can crack on with a fish so those chips have now been in the beef dripping for about six minutes they got nice and golden at 150. i'm going to let them sit there and calm down i'm going to turn the oil up to 180 and then i'm going to drop them in for a second fry right now fish and chips it's a white fish coley cod pollock halibut whatever you really like i'm using classic cod one of the key things that you need to do is you need to lightly salt it and you do that for two reasons one to season the fish but you do it an hour before to bring out some of that moisture to firm the fish up so let's set that aside and crack on with the batter we're going to make the batter for the fish now getting the batter right makes or breaks this dish i'm going to use an ipa from one of my favorite breweries and that flavour is going to really help the batter we're also making a beer batter we're not making a tempura batter it's quite a heavy batter so let's get this right by starting off and sifting some rice flour one third of rice flour to two-thirds self-raising flour and we sift it to get air into the batter [Music] okay then yeah that's beer it's beer okay so now we're going to gradually add this in [Music] okay now this is a piston tip but we want some vodka in there it's got a high alcohol level so when it hits the hot oil it evaporates immediately and makes the batter super crunchy so you want about 25 mils of vodka into the batter okay so it's really all right um you want to have double cream consistency where it's ribboning that's perfect now let's get the fish out the fridge okay so the fish now has firmed up really nice you can feel that it's more robust so what i'm going to do now is i'm just going to take the skin off this card with a filleting knife so there we go no meat left on the skin now brim this down then just with your finger run it through the fish and you'll notice that there's some little pin bones tiny little bones in there just grab them tweezers works best but i haven't got any and just pull them out and just getting those out of the cod so i'm now going to portion this into two i want nice big fillets so i'm just going to cut them on the slant in half season some plain flour with a little bit of salt just mix that in and then i'm going to take the cod dip it in the flour so that it allows the batter to take to it right moment of truth so get your cod dip it into our batter let it drain any excess and then when it starts dripping hold it in to your beef dripping just let it start frying and then let it in and bombs away and we've got that at 150. two quintessential accompaniments were fish and chips tartar sauce and mushy peas now tartar sauce follow this so i've got three anchovy phillips that are finely diced up i've got four nice sized gherkins and the same amount of capers and they've all been put into the bowl now i'm gonna add a good chunk of diced banana shallots a load of flat leaf parsley that's been finely chopped add those in and then i've got these um boiled eggs that are just gooey on the middle dice those through and get that in it's a bit messy but that's absolutely fine i'm just going to put about four good dollops of mayo in there zest a lemon you just want half of that lemon in there and then i'm just going to slice it up and squeeze a little bit of that in then you want some salt pepper and then we're just going to bring all those ingredients together and there you've got super chunky super tasty tartar sauce now let's crack on with the mushy peas next up mushy peas now not everybody will know about mushy peas because it is quintessentially the british accompaniment it's delicious it's simple and we're going to do it with some beautiful mint which is best mates with peas so first off i've got some banana shallots which i've diced i'm going to fry those in some butter drop some frozen peas into boiling water bring it back up to the boil and then drop a good bunch of mint in there cook until the peas are cooked then drain let's get the peas in with the shallots [Music] okay so you've got your butter your sweet shallots your sweet beautiful peas now we're gonna get some freshly sea salted salty happiness yes that is a term uh we're gonna get some freshly cracked pepper in there and then you want about two tablespoons of double cream and we're gonna mush that in you don't have to put the double cream in i do to make it just really indulgent that's a great side order anyway to go with anything okay now i'm gonna mush everything down [Music] okay so get yesterday's paper get that ready because in the uk fish and chips is traditionally served in yesterday's newspaper and then we're gonna go and get the chips to drop on [Music] okay now i've dropped it onto some kitchen roll just to get rid of the excess fat and then let's get it onto the chips [Music] how amazing is that bloody feast i can't wait to get stuck into it oh how much how much come on

in your hands and then crunch as hell in your garb right so first off what's it saying to you chips oh crispy beautiful fluffy inside but crunch on the outside i mean the fish it's crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside chips are really crispy could we say these are the best chips you've ever had they're like crispy you think they're too oily a little bit yeah not for me i'm not sure you know what you're going on about if i'm honest [Music] perfect cheers there you go there you go okay and what and what are you saying about the fish it's good [Music] well that's good right so what would you pay for whole fish and chips i would pay pay 10 pounds 10 pounds 10 pounds good and strong i think 10 from how good the fish is boom boom loving it how much would you pay six i knew it was going to be lower than 10. i knew it and just something told me [Music] okay guys thank you so much thanks for hanging around good on you pleasure now if you're going to cook on the street you're
