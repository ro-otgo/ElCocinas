made with guinness beer tender root vegetables and chunks of hearty meat this irish stew is rich delicious and super easy to make hey everybody kristen here as someone who suffers from a chronic disease i believe homemade is best but it doesn't need to be complicated i had several requests the past couple weeks to share with you a recipe for st patrick's day and while i have a delicious instant pot corned beef and cabbage recipe that you can get by clicking the link above i felt like it was high time this irish girl share with you more irish recipes so that's exactly what we're going to do today i'm going to show you how to make a delicious irish inspired stew so let's get cooking to start this recipe we're gonna hit saute on our instant pot and add in a little bit of oil we're gonna let our oil heat while we season up our meat now it's traditional in irish stews to use lamb stew meat however it's a lot easier for me to find beef and it's a lot more affordable even with the prices of beef going sky high right now i have a little over a pound of meat here that i'm patting dry with a paper towel that way our meat can get nice and golden brown when it sears and then i'm going to season generously with salt and pepper once the oil is heated i'm going to add my seasoned meat right to my inner pot just in a nice even layer there we're going to sear that for just a couple minutes on each side just until it's golden brown it doesn't need to be perfect my meat looks nice and golden and so i'm going to remove it now to a plate to our inner pot we're going to saute some onions and garlic and celery and really build the flavors of this stew now it's a little hard to see in my instant pot right now but i still have a little bit of oil and some fat that's rendered from the stew meat if you didn't you would want to add just a little bit more oil right now to my inner pot i'm adding in one small minced onion and one stalk of celery that's been finely minced we're going to saute that up just for a couple minutes until our onion begins to soften now the celery is totally not traditional in my classic beef stew but i really like the celery in this stew because it adds a nice bright fresh flavor that's going to counteract with some of the bitterness of the beer that we're going to add here in just a little bit that's looking good now and so i'm going to add in two tablespoons of tomato paste one tablespoon of minced garlic which is about three cloves of minced garlic and one teaspoon of dried thyme i'm just going to saute that just for 30 seconds to a minute just to toast the tomato paste and bring out its richness and to of course toast the garlic in time as well but we don't want our garlic to burn that'll ruin a dish really fast and now you know the drill we must deglaze our pan to get up all those brown bits on the bottom of our inner pot and there's a lot of them today so for my thin liquid today i'm adding a 12 ounce bottle of guinness beer extra stout guinness beer and then i'm just gonna scrape scrape scrape get up all those brown bits really make sure to get all the bottom of the inner pot and now we're just gonna let that simmer for a couple minutes to slightly reduce and really develop its flavor typically i tell you that if you don't drink alcohol you can substitute the beer or wine in a recipe with additional stock for this irish stew i really really do recommend a stout beer it's going to give this irish stew all of its flavor the beer has tones of coffee and caramel and just so much rich flavor that to make this stew using only beef broth won't impart the same results now we want to hit cancel on our instant pot to turn off the saute function after our dentist has simmered for a couple minutes and to the inner pot i'm adding in two and a half cups of low sodium beef broth now if you like a thicker stew i recommend only using two cups of beef broth we like our stew a little bit on the thinner side so i'm using a full two and a half cups to further season this braising liquid i'm adding in one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and one tablespoon of maple syrup the maple syrup may sound like an odd addition but we need a little sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes and the bitterness of the beer and the maple syrup pairs beautifully with the stout beer the notes are very similar you can certainly use honey or granulated sugar but for the best flavor i do recommend using pure maple syrup also adding in two bay leaves about a teaspoon of salt you can certainly reduce that salt to just a half a teaspoon if you need to watch your sodium and finally we need to add in our seared meat back to the inner pot now that's it for right now we're going to cook our meat first so that we can add our vegetables later so they don't get mushy nobody wants mushy vegetables so we're going to pop our lid on our instant pot we're going to make sure our vent knob is pointed towards sealed and then we're going to set the cooking time for 30 minutes on high pressure don't be tempted to use the stew button we want to be in control of the cooking time ourselves so that we can guarantee great results so you're gonna hit manual or pressure cook and then use the plus or minus buttons to adjust until the time reads 30 minutes while the meat is cooking let's use this time to prep our veggies i have two parsnips and two carrots that i'm peeling and then chopping into one-inch chunks parsnips are traditional in irish stew and they have a nice sweet earthy flavor sort of like a mild carrot if you don't have parsnips or you can't find them or you just don't want to use them you can certainly use an additional two carrots now for the potatoes you can use russet you can use yukon gold you can even use red potatoes i have baby yellow potatoes today and you want to make sure your potatoes are in larger bite sized pieces like one to one and a half chunk sizes if your baby potatoes are on the larger side you want to cut them in half and the smaller ones you can leave whole now once the cooking time has elapsed it is really important to let pressure release on its own for at least 15 minutes so that our meat stays tender once pressure has been released you can open up your instant pot we're gonna add in our veggies i have those carrots that i chopped and the parsnips and i have about one pound of baby potatoes that i'm adding we're gonna pop our lid back on our instant pot make sure your vent knob is sealed if you happen to do a release of pressure after 15 minutes and then we're going to set our cooking time for only three minutes on high pressure three minutes is all you need to get those vegetables tender and our beef to finish cooking once the cooking time has elapsed you must let pressure release naturally for 15 minutes again that way the meat stays tender and the vegetables finish cooking through then you can open up your instant pot smells so so good in here it almost smells a little bit like coffee i'm telling you i wish you guys could smell it now at this point your stew is completely ready to serve and it's just the way my family likes it however if you like stew on a thicker side what you would want to do right now is you would want to turn your instant pot back to saute and let the stew come to a bubble only take a minute and then you want to mix together one tablespoon of cornstarch with one tablespoon of water until the cornstarch is dissolved add that to your inner pot whisk it in and let your stew bubble until it thickens it shouldn't take that long but i'm ready to dish this up right now going for a bite just so that you guys know it tastes good it's a winner all right the vegetables are super crisp tender and the meat it's fall apart but the real magic of this stew is that guinness i'm telling you the caramel coffee undertones oh it's just perfection it's made this irish girl happy i hope it makes you guys happy too but if you're not in the mood for an irish stew be sure to check out my next recipe where i share with you how to make classic beef stew using the instant pot until then happy cooking
