[Music] even folks exclu the for this evening unless you had a meet one of America's classic recipes homemade beef stew it's very simple to put together and I think you'd like my rendition quite a bit so let me get started here and show you exactly how I put my beef stew recipe together what I've done is I've taken about two pounds of chuck roast I've cut it into about one inch cube something like this you use sirloin tips and what I want to do is I want to take this up and and just basically flour the cubes of Chuck and then we'll put this into about three tablespoons of cooking oil and I'm gonna Brown my meat off just gonna bash your stuff up a little bit and put this in here when I get this meat round up we'll go to the next step and this beef stew the recipe all right we've got this leat nice is round off we're going to remove it from our stockpot [Music] [Music] all right we've removed all of our round meat we're gonna add one whole onion three tops those garlic celery stalks chopped up we'll deglaze the pan with a cup of red wine drink wine you can certainly use beef stock and we'll just take this just let these vegetables out here for a minute and come back and I'll show you the next step [Applause] all right we've got our vegetables basically cooked off we'll throw in two fresh bay leaves two sprigs of thyme and it'll put in a 7 ounce can of tomato paste and stir this around a little bit use the tomatoes with the walls here and now what we can do is round off some cracked black pepper that's ten rotations or so and then what I want to do is I'm going to return our round off stoop meet here who are vegetables and to this we're going to add 32 ounces of beef stock and the trick to this recipe of course is rounding off the beef to sear in the flavors and then you want to go low and slow on this guy I'll put all in the whole 32 ounces I'm gonna bring this thing up to a ball I'm gonna cover it up and put it on low for about two hours and we'll come back and I'll show you the next step alright this has been going slow and low about two hours so we're gonna take our automatics out of here time disregard that there's our bay leaf right there and another one in there I guess we're gonna get sets I'm gonna be doing the dishes and I've chopped up a carrot we'll put that in there and then I've got two white potatoes that I will put in with our stew here and as you may have noticed earlier I have not put any salt into the stew yet because it will make the meat tougher so I want to put in about a tablespoon and a half of this pink Himalayan salt that I like and as we to do that we'll stir the stew up I've added no additional flour to this whatsoever it's just the flour that created the thickness here then we round the meat so we're gonna take this from low up to medium-high we'll cook these potatoes for about seven or eight minutes in this do we'll be ready to plate up all right well there's the finished product the ball chefs version of beef stew it's been cooking for a while here this meat it's gonna be tender I'm sure and some carrots it's got a nice little gravy to it it's taking a little piece of this meat out of here and see how how this rendition of my beef stew came out here very tender the sauce is bordering on spectacular I appreciate you folks taking the time to watch you put this recipe together today join me on Google+ subscribe to my channel if you like got some interesting recipes going on here and I could always use a new subscriber I like that if you like what you see and as always thanks for watching and Bon Appetit
