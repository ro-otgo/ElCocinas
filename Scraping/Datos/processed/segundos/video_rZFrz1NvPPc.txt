today I'm going to show you guys how to make an easy beef stew in the crock pot now I have made um pot roast or beef stew where you brown the meat but a lot of you have commented a couple of you have sent me email messages where you want a beef stew recipe that's a bit easier that skips the step where you brown the meat first so this is the one this is kind of like a dumping a dump and go crock pot beef stew so here I'm working with about two and a half to three pounds of beef chuck roast that I've already cut into like large chunks so the first thing I'm going to do is add two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce so I'm going to use a clean hand and just work that in I'm going to coat the meat put a half teaspoon of salt remember the Worcestershire sauce I know I'm probably saying it wrong Worcestershire worst Worcestershire uh it's has you know it's salty so you don't want to go too much with the the salt here give that a mix cracked black pepper like a half teaspoon if you're using a fine ground pepper then a quarter teaspoon I'm also going to add like a half teaspoon of dried thyme you really can add dried herbs to your preference I'm just going to go with some dried thyme now I'm going to shake in five tablespoons of all-purpose flour five tablespoons of all-purpose flour and coat this meat this is going to help thicken whatever rendered juices end up in the crock pot okay nicely coated there we go I'm going to go over the other ingredients here I have a pound and a half to two pounds of gold potatoes that I just semi-peeled I rinsed and I cut them into chunks I have three medium to large carrots that I cut into chunks actually I think this was more like two or was it three yeah three medium carrots three cloves of garlic minced and two celery sticks that I chopped I rinsed clean chopped and I even chopped in the celery leaves I think that adds great flavor very aromatic and I'm also going to be adding the beefy onion soup mix that comes in a pack here I'm working with a six quart crock pot and I'm going to add my meat here we go I'm shaking whatever [Music] okay I'm gonna just make sure that's all mixed and evenly on the bottom there okay so there we go come on I'm gonna go in with my celery just put that on top here I have my garlic going in and my beefy onion soup dry mix I love using this because it makes life easy so this is why I didn't chop up any onions because you know I have this just sprinkle that on top now going in with my potatoes and carrots and that's that I'm going to cover I'm going to cover with a lid I'm also going to be adding one dried bay leaf before I forget this goes great with the other aromatics in this beef stew so going into the crock pot I'm going to quickly do this when you lift the lid too much on your crock pot it takes it longer so I nestled it right in here it takes it longer to come up to heat and to start cooking so sorry okay I'll be back Okay so it's three hours into the cook time and I want to give it a a mix here and combine everything it smells wonderful but I wanna you can see how much liquid has accumulated in the crock pot oh smells good with the thyme and the bay leaf and the celery and the garlic and the okay quickly cover with the lid and I'm just going to let this continue cooking on a high heat it's been about three hours so maybe another hour and a half I'll check it okay so I have peas here I would say this is like almost two cups of peas I'm going to rinse these okay so these are rinsed oh smells amazing and it's foggy sorry so I'm gonna add my peas this is already at four hours of cook time on high and the meat is getting there but I do want it to cook for another hour but again look at this it's already forming like that gravy and you know what I'm gonna take out the bay leaf I think it's done its job so mix in the peas okay one more hour foreign some bread in this cast iron skillet have a little bit of butter here well it's more like like a tablespoon [Music] and here I have some French bread and I'm just going to toast that make sure I get butter on both sides foreign there we go okay so it has been five hours and before I give it a stir you see how some of the fat has pulled at the top I'm just going to skim that off and this is done I'm really trying not to get any there we go okay so this is nice and toasty I'm gonna put one right there okay so now I'm going to look at this this is perfect everything is soft and tender the meat just falls apart when you push on it it's so good the potatoes are soft and creamy but they still hold a good texture so it doesn't disintegrate by the time the meat gets soft but this is so good this is going to be so good I have some chopped parsley I'm gonna do a little bit on top there we go now good Scoop of this [Music] right on top of the bread [Music] it's dinner I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching foreign [Music] [Music]
