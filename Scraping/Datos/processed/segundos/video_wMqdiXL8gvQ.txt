[Music] hi guys i'm laura batali on this episode of lauren kitchen i'm going to show you how to make a gorgeous easy and delicious like sausage stuffed pork loin which i know it sounds like a lot and it is very rich it's very delicious and it's perfect for your easter table or any special occasion i love this recipe the versatility is incredible i am showing you what i feel like are the basic ingredients that go really really well together but by all means feel free to be as creative as you want to be i'm using a pork loin it's lean it's delicious everyone seems to love it however if you can find a boneless skin on uh like shoulder pork shoulder you could roast that i love it it's definitely richer in flavor you have to cook it a bit longer you want it to reach about 205 or slightly over whereas a pork tenderloin or a pork loin like i'm using today i like to cook it to about 150 and it's perfectly juicy every single time now i've got about a four and a half pounder here i don't really need to trim a lot off because it's got a nice thin layer of fat which i want to keep because otherwise it's just way too lean and here's how you butterfly this is how i do it anyway by no means am i perfect at this but instead of slicing it halfway down you're gonna slice it in thirds so you're going to go to the top third like that don't go all the way through and it just takes a bit to maneuver because it is a really big piece of meat you're going to go about you want a nice thin layer on of the top and i'll show you why in just a minute so you open it up like a book you can see this side much thinner than this side so now over here you're going to go under and you're going to split that in half and you're going to open it up like a book i find it easier to work with one side at a time but really what i really love and i don't have a round bear is my little very sharp paring knife to do this with but it works you're just gonna go ahead and get this open like i said you're kind of gonna get it open like a book and it does not really matter if it's not 100 perfect because you're going to pound it out anyway and you just want it to be nice and even when you go to roll it because that's really the important part okay so once you have that third layer all sort of opened up like so you're gonna cover it with plastic wrap i'm doing this on my wood board but it is layered on both sides with plastic wrap you're gonna take your meat mallet and you're gonna pound it a little bit so that it's thinner easier to stuff easier to roll okay good enough you can see it's pretty much even all the way i don't know if you can really tell but pretty much even all the way i'm gonna go ahead and just move it to the side because i do need my board now because i'm hungry and i need to move quickly don't have my grater here so hold that thought so what i have in the skillet is a mixture of hot sausage and sweet pork cooked it because i wanted to render its fat i'm going to go ahead and pop the in a food processor because i want that to be extremely finely chopped now i know what you're saying lara i don't really want to add you know sausage in the thing that's a lot it's really rich you don't have to do a breading stuffing i'm going to show you i'm going to add bread i'm going to add cheese i'm going to add herbs and garlic you can just build on that you can just do an all bread and herb stuffing which is phenomenal you could add pancetta instead you could add raisins you could add dried fruit and they would be fantastic i'm just going to go ahead well there we go i want that really finely chopped your sausage is well crumbled to the same food processor this is just a couple of hoagie rolls um they're stale that end is a little bit tough i'm going to add a couple of them in here you want a total of about 8 ounces if you were to weigh it so about a half a pound of italian bread if you are using a sourdough or something where the crust is super super super thick then i may just want you to remove the crust but i'm just going to go ahead and do the same thing this is sort of like the breading portion right think of stuffing think of thanksgiving stuffing same thing let's see yeah that's good enough beautiful add that in okay now that's like the bulk right now you're gonna go ahead and take a few cloves of garlic i know that you could add garlic to a cooking sausage for some reason i just like when you add the garlic to the mixture when it's raw i think you get such a better flavor more you know more pronounced flavor a stem of celery now i listen i might have had a lot of coffee today but it could not have been that strong rosemary i'm just gonna take i'm actually gonna use two let's just go ahead and use two okay and then we're going to do a handful of parsley but first i want to go ahead and get my garlic peeled smashed peeled all the goods so we've got parsley rosemary garlic chopped up added in i'm not adding any salt to that because i'm gonna salt the pork itself and the sausage is very salty i went ahead and added some toasted pine nuts lovely texture beautiful nutty flavor just make sure you go ahead and toast them first to really bloom their oils and flavor lots of parmigiano you could also add pecorino and i would prefer it not gonna lie to you i would prefer it was i gonna make an extra stop at the grocery store this morning no because i forgot but i would really prefer some picorino because it's got really sharp sharp flavor and i think i would really like i know i would because i made it before without parm and i did picorino and it was fantastic so there's that so there is your cheese your bread your sausage i'm going to go ahead and add a little bit of vino if you don't want to add any dry white wine which i'm using some pinot grigio you don't have to you can go ahead and just leave it out completely and add some chicken stock which i'm going to but you can add all stock if you want to again think of what we are making as like you're making a stuffing right it's really no different it's just so delicious you want this to be nice and moistened but kind of hold together so that's looking pretty fantastic go ahead and season the inside of your pork well because we didn't add any salt to the stuffing but i do want to be seasoned well black pepper i'm going to go and go ahead and use my hands for this because i just feel like it's the easiest way oh yeah that is good stuffing and it's so good you know what i did with the leftovers and you have to trust me on this i know i'm gonna sound like a crazy person but i took leftovers and if you follow me on instagram you'll already know because you saw it i took leftovers sliced it really really thinly like shaved it pretty much and i made like a gravy with the leftover sauce and everything that i had made for the roast and i made hot roast pork sandwiches by char prolonged and broccoli rob let me tell you something i could open up a shop because they were so good oh my goodness okay i was listen even i was shocked at myself that's how good it was okay that looks phenomenal look how good that looks beautiful and the the stuffing really helps keep the pork nice and moist okay i want to move some things around let me go wash my hands really quickly because i hate to work with messy hands i'm turning it over to the side just because it's easier for me to roll i've got some kitchen twine here you want to start rolling you want the top to be where the fat cap is right because you want that to roast and render and do all kinds of magical things and you're just going to literally roll this like a jelly roll right and if some of the filling spilled out trust me it is fine it is fine and if some of it kind of tears open a little bit at the bottom trust me it is fine okay i'm going to leave it like that just for a second because i find it easier to i'm leaving it to the side because i find it easier to lay out all of my twine before i do pretty much anything else okay tie some kitchen twine all around like that you kind of want to keep everything in place keep it shape keep the filling from rolling out it's just a good practice okay it's a little bit of a messy job but you know it is very worth it you're going to have to trust me on that go and then we have one more piece i'm going to put in the very front here beautiful again keeps the shape keeps everything together beautiful beautiful beautiful i just wanna you know i don't function well in a messy cooking environment but when you're making something like this it's kind of like making thanksgiving dinner right when you are cooking for thanksgiving you know it is a disaster in your kitchen i do try to keep things looking smooth and nice and all that jazz but you know i don't know why that's in here because i don't need that i don't even put this over a wire rack or anything i plunk it right in here i take all the tops of the string because i have to cut them off anyway i take all of those and i just do it like so like i said i don't put anything alongside i don't need to however i am going to take a head of garlic in about because this is going to take about an hour so to roast i'm going to take a head of garlic i like to dry the top salt liberally the top the sides roll it around to season underneath and then pepper same thing roll it around to season the underneath take some chicken stock i was saying was this is going to take a bit to cook but in a bit i'm going to take a head of garlic and i'm going to throw it in there to roast alongside because we're going to want that later for the sauce a little bit of white wine i've got some rosemary tucked under there you know me i am a fan of the trusty trusty probe i like my meat cooked perfectly i'm going to set this at 150 which is perfectly safe for a pork loin so i'm going to go ahead and just set my temperature to 150 and when it's there it'll be done and then we will let it rest and we'll make our sauce to go with that's it 400 degrees and she goes whoa okay pork was in the oven it was actually in the oven about an hour now remember i told you i like to cook mine to the internal temperature of about 150 once it cools and sets for half an hour before slicing it will carry overcook to about 160 to me that is perfect if i were to take that out at 165 by the time you sit down to eat it it'll be 180 and it is gonna be dry as a bone however if we were doing this with a boneless shoulder cook it to about 205 to 215 because it's a different kind of meat so it's gonna need all that time to really break down and get tender think of it like when you cook a pulled pork or any kind of uh recipe that calls for a shoulder anyway to make the sauce it's very really really really simple i took a head of garlic and i roasted it alongside the pork loin until it's lovely and tender and delicious and i'm going to add it to my skillet here with some olive oil now you have to give me a second it's very hot i'm just going to squeeze it out whoa that's hot trying to squeeze it with my hand but i'm going to need a muffin that's going to give you really yummy oh my word rich garlic flavor i'll take the peel out let me get a smaller tonight to get the rest out you want all that really delicious sweetness there we go a little dried oregano dry basil situation now to this i'm going to add a bit of white wine if you don't want to use it leave it out let that just sort of reduce for a minute now what i have in here in my fat separator is the juices from the pork i'm going to go ahead and add them in don't add the fat just add the bottom which is why i put it in a fat separator because i don't want that because that you can sort of still see where there's like the good juices at the bottom and then the red like the fat sort of rises to the top we don't want the fat we don't want a really greasy um a really greasy situation nobody wants that crank that up i'm going to add a bit more chicken stock here just because i feel like we need it for the amount of pork that we are going to be serving and i'm going to just bring that to a boil and let it reduce by about half sauce looks great i'm going to go ahead and add a corn starch slurry which is just some corn starch and some water just mix it together it will thicken that sauce beautifully while that happens we can go ahead and start carving the the roast get that out of the way take some kitchen scissors you got to cut off that twine that's important i left one on look at that now i want you to see something i want you to see how beautiful the fat you know that little layer of fat cap is now i'm trying to see if you can hear it it's now crispy and gorgeous every single oven is different i have three ovens in my house they cook differently if i were cooking this not in this oven but in a different oven i would have to turn the broiler on for the last couple of minutes to get that really gorgeous deep crust they just cook differently so if you are at the one hour mark and you feel like your top is not looking like this turn the broiler on for a couple minutes and it will get there like i said every oven is different it's nearly impossible sometimes for me to give a correct estimate of how long something takes to cook because i test them i'm going to go over here because that that that one's the cook's treat but i want you to see how juicy it is can you see right there look at the juiciness you see that i really hope you can see it it is absolutely perfectly perfectly perfectly cooked it is such a pleasure to eat it really is not difficult to make at all especially when it comes to something like a stuffed roast it's one of the easiest i think to pull off it is such a celebration everyone loves it leftovers are so phenomenal whether you make hot roast pork or whatever you can make whatever you want everyone loves it you can make a hash make whatever you want this is mine cook street you always have to have one of those when i do go to serve this i am gonna go ahead and put some parsley but look at this you have to do a bit more fresh rosemary around and i'm going to decorate this really nice with fresh herbs and maybe some garlic you have to take some of this roasted garlic sauce pour it all over let it drink it up i'm just gonna pretend i'm gonna take that to the table which i really am but now just pretend that this is oh i just need that and crust need that crispy crust in that sauce with a little bit of the stuffing on top it is beyond delicious the stuffing keeps everything flavorful and moist chinatown go a lot and you get to come for the great recipe perfect for your easter table i really hope you enjoy spending time with me and i will see in the next one [Music] you
