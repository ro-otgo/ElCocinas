hey everybody I'm tamesha and welcome back to my kitchen happy Sunday to you all and thank you so much for joining me in my kitchen as I show you how I am preparing our Sunday dinner for my family so today I'm going to show you how I make a delicious oven roasted lemon herb chicken I want to show you how to get that nice beautiful crispy brown skin wow that chicken is so juicy and moist on the inside so let's go ahead and get over to our other than get started all right you guys so I already have my oven preheated to 350 degrees and I am starting with a six pound chicken so when you cook your chicken you want to cook it on 350 degrees for 20 minutes per pound so I'm gonna actually put my chicken in the oven for two hours but I'm gonna actually be honest I'm gonna put it in the oven for two and a half hours because I don't play with raw chicken so I need to make sure my chicken is done all the way so my chicken is already I already cleaned it well you want to start with a fully defrosted chicken I should say that first but my chicken is clean I trimmed it just a little bit took off some of the extra fat I did leave some on for the pan drippings when we cook it and clean out into cavity so let's talk about the cavity on your whole roasted chicken so sometimes people are intimidated to cook a whole roasted chicken because of the cavity and because of the package that comes in the chicken so in that package you know some people might think is an inconvenience but that package is actually a blessing you guys because you can make a gravy out of the pack that comes in the chicken with the giblets and you know all the the innards of the chicken I know it sounds girls to talk about but don't be discouraged if you have that pack in your chicken you can actually use it to make a delicious gravy I know it's delicious because that's how I grew up with my parents using that the pantry bins to make a gravy but we're not going to use our package today I actually just cleaned out the cavity that cavity is what we're going to use to infuse our lemon and our herb flavor throughout the entire chicken so we're going to hit this chicken with our spices and our seasonings from the cavity we're also going to season underneath the skin and we're going to massage and season the entire chicken as a whole so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start by getting our vegetables into this pan so and I'm just using a heavy-duty skillet that I just lined with aluminum foil because that's what I have I didn't actually have a casserole or baking dish for this but you use whatever you have you can use a Dutch oven you can use a cast-iron pan for this to cook your chicken if you want to you can even cook it in a crock pot as well just keep in mind if you do cook it in a crock pot you're not going to have that crispy skin but that chicken is actually still going to be super delicious and moist and flavorful for you so we're going to place our chicken on top of these vegetables when we cook it after we finished season our chicken and when I don't worry about seasoning our vegetables because all of the juices that are going to cook down from the chicken are going to season our vegetables for us so let's get started on seasoning her up alright guys so what I'm doing now is salt seasoning the inside of our cavity with salt and crushed black pepper so that's what I have in this container and this stuff is actually important because you want to make sure that your chicken is well-seasoned and using that cavity is important because it's going to your chicken cut flavor from the inside out okay so that is good so what I have in this bowl here this is what we're going to use to massage our chicken so I'm starting off with four tablespoons of butter I have just a little bit of salt and pepper in here as well I also have some fresh parsley I have one tablespoon of Italian seasoning one tablespoon of minced garlic 1 tablespoon of granulated garlic I also have one tablespoon of onion powder one teaspoon of paprika as well as one teaspoon of sage and I also have some sprigs of fresh thyme so we're going to get this mixed up and this is going to be what we're going to use to season our chicken from the outside and my butter has to sing out for a little bit so it's nice and softened alright so our butter is nice and mixed up well with our spices and fresh herbs so we're going to just take this this is the part you gotta get down and dirty with and don't be don't be scared you got to give her a nice good massage you gotta show her some love and get all in every single crevice lift her wings up you want to make sure that your seasonings is well coded all over your chicken and right here this is another thing that I like to do see where you can kind of put your fingers in here I want to take some of that butter and go in underneath the skin as well and just kind of when you push to push the butter in just come from the top and kind of spread it through the other side as well just push it in and just smooth it out all right so I'm going to give her a nice massage give her all the attention she needs coat every single part of the chicken and then we come back I'm going to show you how to stuff our cavity all right so our chicken is nice and seasoned what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the cavity and with one tablespoon of minced garlic now you can definitely use fresh garlic for this but I have minced garlic so that is what I'm working with today set that to the side and in this bowl I have one medium onion that I just cut into fours as well as two large lemons that I've sliced up and what I do that you can see on the lemon I actually I've done this whipped a whole lemon without taking the skin off sometimes and sometimes with a large lemon it can be a little extra bitter for my taste so I didn't remove all of the rind from the lemon I just went and slice some of it off just so to keep it from being having a bitter flavor to it but we're going to take our lemon as well as our onion and I also have a sprig of rosemary and we're going to stuff the cavity of our chicken with this and this is where your flavor infusion comes in so I'm going to get all of this stuff in and then when I'm finished with that we're going to transfer our chicken over to our pan that we're going to roast it in alright guys so here is our chicken nice and seasoned and our cavity is stuffed with our onions and our lemons as well as our rosemary so at this point you could you could tie your legs off with some kitchen twine I generally just let her fly freedom when I cook it but what that will do is to ensure that your legs are not cooking faster than the rest of the chicken so that it's they're not overcooked but what I am going to do is I'm going to get this tensive or the piece of foil for the first hour just because I don't want my chicken to dry out it's Betsy up breasts so then have it sit for the first hour and then the last hour and a half of cooking I will remove the foil tent and um let it do the rest of the cooking and then it will be done so I'm going to get us into our oven for two two and a half hours and then when we come back I will show you our delicious crispy Brown flavorful and moist chicken all right guys so our chicken is out of the oven it's about two and a half hours later and what I'm doing right now is something that I did throughout the baking process it's just basically taking the pan drippings and basing our chicken with it so you want to do that you know maybe every 30 minutes while you're cooking that's how often I did it so what I'm going to do is let this sit for about 10 minutes because you don't want to cut right into your chicken you want to give the juices inside enough time to settle and registry distribute themselves throughout the chicken and as you can see our vegetables at the bottom of pan of the pan are nice and fork tender and this chicken is nice and golden brown probably a little more Brown that I originally planned but I actually like my chicken to go for a while so that the skin is nice and brown and crispy so I'm going to let it sit for about ten minutes and then I will get it on our platter ready to serve all right guys here it is dinner is ready so we have our lemon herb roasted whole chicken as you can see it is nicely brown you can see all of those seasonings and spices all crusted on the chicken we have our vegetables that we cooked underneath the chicken goes in nice and tender and roast it and seasoned from the chicken and you compare this whatever you want to for dinner we are just having a side of rice as well as the remaining vegetables that were baked into chicken so yeah you guys I really hope
