addictively delicious i hope you guys ready to see how it's done but before i begin if you're new don't forget to subscribe before you leave like the video if you enjoy and let's get started [Music] here's what you need to make this recipe i'm using pepper flakes about five cloves of garlic also i am using salt and pepper and as well as some honey also here we have some vinegar it doesn't really matter you can use the still vinegar apple cider vinegar or whatever you have we have some oyster sauce as well as some soy sauce also we have some all-purpose flour with unsalted butter and over here we have a little bit of chicken broth and of course here is the star of the show the chicken breast shall we begin let's get started [Music] to begin i am going to take a sharp knife and just slice my chicken breast right in the middle just like that [Music] all right now that you have your chicken breast nice and sliced you are going to take a meat tenderizer to flatten your chicken breast now you don't have to use a meat tenderizer you can also use a rolling pin if you don't have a meat tenderizer now we're doing this is because we want the chicken to be nice and flat and that way it'll cook faster [Music] now if you want you can cut your chicken into bite size if you don't want to cut your chicken the way i cut mine you can also cut them into right sides [Music] now it's time to season our chicken breast what i'm doing first is drizzling a little bit of olive oil onto the chicken once i am done i am going to use my hand to rub it in next i am about to take my seasoning to season the chicken breast i am using salt and pepper and don't worry guys i know i'm not using a lot of seasoning that i normally use but all the flavor is going to come from the garlic the oyster sauce the soy sauce this will come out so good once it's done so just trust the process okay now we're going to sprinkle the salt and pepper all over the chicken breast then we're going to flip it over and of course add the salt and pepper on the other side [Music] now you're going to take your flour you're going to dredge the chicken into the flour you want a light coat of the flour don't overdo it you don't want the breading to be too heavy so don't overdo it and i'll show you guys what to do with it next [Music] in once you are done adding the flour to all of your chicken you're going to set them aside to cook the chicken i am going to add two tablespoons of unsalted butter to a frying pan oops i added a little bit too much two tablespoons once melted we're going to add the chicken in as you guys can see i have some new frying pan i have some new cooking wear that i'm very excited to cook with and this is not sponsored i bought them from amazon i will have a link below if you're interested so we're going to add the chicken in don't move it don't touch it just let it cook for about five minutes per side then flip it over cook the other side you all know how dry chicken breast can be sometimes now if you know how to properly cook them it will not be dry so don't overcook your chicken breast that's the key if you overcook it it will be dry guaranteed dry dry dry so try not to overcook your chicken breast so it can be nice and juicy once your chicken is done cooking you're going to remove it set it aside just look how beautiful this came out i just love cooking in this new frying pan because my food come out so colorful and not burnt so what we're going to do now is use the same skillet i know i washed mine but use the same skillet add the rest of the butter in you are going to cook your garlic okay that's that's the garlic right there make sure you chop them pretty small unless you like chewing on big chunks of garlic so make sure you mince them so we're going to cook the garlic until it's kind of fragrant and turning golden brown and then you can add the remaining of the ingredients [Music] a few seconds later i am going in with my dry pepper flakes don't add too much of this a little bit goes a long way okay so i am going to add that in and stir it together next i am going in with my honey just pour that in honey garlic i love love love the combination of that flavor all right now i am going to stir it together as the honey is cooking make sure you're cooking it on medium low at this point now i'm going to be adding in my oyster sauce just stir it in and of course i have to get every little bit of sauce so i went ahead and grabbed a spoon and just scraped every little bit of oyster sauce that was on that little bowl now i'm going to be adding in my vinegar and of course we're going to add in the soy sauce as well like i said you can add any type of vinegar in this it doesn't really matter just to add some hints of vinegary flavor in there now i am going in with my chicken broth of course once i'm done pouring that in i am going to stir it let it simmer and we want to let it simmer for about two to three minutes then you can add in your chicken now i am going to be placing the chicken right in the sauce i know the sauce look a little bit watery now but once you add the chicken don't forget the chicken has that flour breading to it it will make it nice and thick and this is basically a few minutes after i turned down my heat as you guys can see and look how perfect our chicken looks i am going to use some fresh parsley just you know just for garnish just add it on top of there and at this point your meal your dish is ready this is how you make the perfect honey garlic chicken thank you for watching guys i
