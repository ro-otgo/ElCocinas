hey salaam i hope you guys do well hello jeff is back for another video and this time i'm making amazing afghan chicken kebabs gonna serve it with a really delicious rice and a flavorful sauce let me give you a quick overview of this dish we're gonna start with our chicken marination leave it for one day to marinate then we're gonna grill them we're gonna start with our beautiful rice cobbly rice along with those raisins carrots and then we're gonna have our beef with sauce made with tomatoes onions fresh coriander green chili oh man you're really gonna enjoy this without further ado let's get started of all grab a ball in with plain yogurt now you want to add some crushed garlic you can add more or less depending on your liking now in with spices we're going to start with red chili powder 2 teaspoons of coriander powder only a teaspoon of cumin powder a teaspoon of paprika powder a teaspoon of turmeric powder a good touch of black pepper finish this off with salt add a touch of olive oil or sunflower oil give this a really good mix the color of this marinade is beautiful it smells amazing now i'm gonna throw in the chicken breast this will cut into medium cubes wash your hands and give this a really good mix now you could use chicken thighs or a mix of both chicken thighs and breasts it's not a problem give this a really good mix and you just want to let it marinate for overnight or for at least five hours all right so that looks great i'm just gonna leave it in the fridge for overnight all right so that's how our chicken looks after it has been marinated for a day looks amazing grab a plate and you need these skewers as well all right so what you want to do is you just want to grab a piece of the chicken you just want to start adding them on the skewers now you want to add around five pieces on each skewer okay very nicely marinated exactly what we were looking for got it right here all right so this one looks great i know it's gonna get messy but don't worry about that grab another one like i said before you don't have to use chicken breasts you can use chicken thighs as well you know it's not a problem now another thing you can do is you can also add onions or peppers you know along with this but today i'm not doing that try to place them in the middle all right so this has made around six to seven of these or so these look great now they're ready to go in the oven all right so grab your grill tray i'm gonna start placing this chicken on there looks amazing trust me so these goes in the grill the grill is on high temperature okay i'm gonna let them grill for around 25 minutes in between we're gonna keep turning them after every six to seven minutes i'm not sure if you can see but these are beautifully cooking what you want to do is you just want to you know turn them around and make sure they cook from all sides okay this one i'm just gonna turn it carefully it's a bit hot there you go so i'm just gonna turn it and you know let them cook from the other side as well look at that so you just want to do this continuously until they are nice and golden brown from all sides brush them with a generous amount of clarified butter this is going to give a nice color and add a bit more flavor to our afghan chicken kebabs all right so this goes back in the grill all right guys for the rice you want the heat to be around medium add in around three big tablespoons of oil into there that's one two and three all right let they get heat up nice and hot throw in the onions just mix that and you just want a bit of color on these onions you don't want them to be too brown it's best to cover the onions for few minutes so they get softer so let's check that onions are getting nice and brown just light brown here you can always add a touch of water to ensure nothing burns all right so the onions have a nice light brown color at this point of time we're gonna add in our ginger garlic and green chili paste this was already blended with some water so that goes straight in or give that a mix let's cook the rawness of this garlic ginger and green chili all right so the ginger garlic and green chili have a bit of color at this point of time we're gonna add in our whole spices here i've got some black cardamom some green cardamom cassia bark bale leaves and i've got some cloves throw that in give that a mix also i'm just gonna throw in our ground spices here i've got some cumin powder some garam masala here i've got some black pepper and salt in it goats give that a mix add in a touch of water water helps in deglazing and ensures nothing burns now we're going to add in the water for the rice how much water you want to add for every cup of rice you want to add one and half cups of water and that we're gonna throw in our rice these rice were soaked in water for at least an hour and a half because these are sailor basmati rice if you are using normal basmati rice they will take around half an hour now once you finish soaking your rice you need to wash them and remove the excess starch as i have explained in my previous videos give this a mix and we want to cook this until there's some water left on the top it's best if you leave this covered let's check the rice just give them a little mix the water is almost evaporating so we just want to keep cooking this now there is some water left in there water i want to cook my carrots i'm just going to throw that carrots on the top just like so beautiful spread that around now you don't have to mix this okay just leave them here on the top because when we're gonna steam our carrots gonna start cooking and it's gonna partially cook just now now what you wanna do now is you want to throw in your sultanas on the top just like so they're going to steam up as well if you don't like sultanas don't worry don't use it it's not a problem all right so at this point of time you want to reduce your heat to very low heat cover this with a clean kitchen cloth place the lid that's properly sealed and we're going to let this steamer for around 12 to 15 minutes on low heat all right so the moment of truth let's check our rice oh man just have a look at that that looks amazing all those beautiful sultanas i'm just gonna fluff it up and you can turn off the heat at this moment oh man look at that beauty beautiful amazing just have a look at that look at those beautiful rice amazing for the sauce adding the tomatoes i've removed the skin by burning it you could also roast this or i'm just gonna mash the soap all right so that's
