well hello there friends very special video today we cooked the chateaubriand filament for two stay tuned i'm gonna show you exactly how to make it remember thumbs up if you liked the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it together well hello there friends wonderful steak today i'm gonna show you how to prepare a double filament uh let's call it the chateaubriand years ago in the in the 70 in the 80s running a french restaurant this was one of the most popular items we had at the restaurant and we used the technique that was called a reverse seal we had another shame the oven special for that where you pre-cooked the meat at 200 degrees so 200 degrees doesn't really cook it just cooks a little bit of it right and then you let it rest and then when you have an order you pop it in the fry pan and you finish the sear it's called the reverse seal so instead of searing it at the beginning to get a golden brown and then pop it in the oven to cook it we're going to do the other way around we're going to cook it first then we're going to pan sear it all right and we're going to do it so like i said years ago these to be called i'm sure in so many restaurants you can still get it it's a perfect roast for two perfect romantic dinner so we're gonna do it right there so what did we do to prepare this thing first of all let me tell you i take a second mortgage and a house for this thing tenderloin beef today oh my goodness expensive like wow i can't believe how expensive it is so we gotta save up for this but it's worth it all right so what i did is uh i i if you have the time get it ready put it on a rack like this salt it all the way around it and leave it air dry in air not cover no plastic nothing put it in the fridge for 24 hours if you have the time if you don't have the time do it one hour before it's still going to help you get a better quest the idea is to dry and to salt to the inside so then it's nice and salty already and it's nice and dry because you see what happened is is because the process of osmosis they it pulls the moisture out and then slowly it goes back in and season the meat you'll be amazed you don't need to put salt anymore it's already seasoned if you do it that way at least an hour before you know you're going to do it so put it on the rack it's well worth it all right so now all we're going to do is we're going to put some black pepper in there that's all we're going to do you can see them with black pepper because we already season it with a salt and my my pepper mirror is oh here you go it's functioning finely and that's what we're gonna do you see just like this and then so now you know by the salt you know about the pepper so how do we get it now without having to worry too much about it how do we get how do we know it's going to be 120 degree on the inside well the best way to do it friends is to use one of those thermometers there's some wireless one i've never used them so i don't know if they're any good so i'm not going to say it but you go right in there friends you poke it right in the middle of it and you go the idea is to poke it and go right in the middle about up to here and right in the middle here so we're going to go in there and we're going to stop and we're going to be about right there in the middle okay now we're going to put the thermometer to let us know when it's 120 125 degrees depends how you like it cook i like my medium rare rare so 120 122 123 degrees it's going to be perfectly fine we're going to take it out we're going to let it rest and after it has rested then we're going to pan sear it and then we're not going to lose any precious juices okay that's all there is to it friends we're gonna go right in there pop it in the oven i love this system this uh thermometer that we have pour it right in here take the wire out put it right there on the outside of your oven you see boom boom right there turn the alarm on it'll tell me when it's 122 degrees for this one so i let it cook uh after that where it's wanted take it out and you'll see we're going to take it out together we're going gonna pan sear it then we're gonna make a little reduction we're gonna serve it with a fondant of potatoes and um and some mixed green beans green and yellow beans all right we'll be back in a few minutes friends when it's out of the oven okay folks i don't know if you can hear but it's beep beep beep that means we're ready to go 122 i put a 122 by like a rare so if you like a little more cook friends you want to certainly cook it a little bit longer and you see when you take it out let me close these guys mamma mia that's alright i'll pick it up later um you see it looks uncooked it looks strange when you look at it right it looks it looks kind of strange but don't let the look fool you you know don't don't judge the book by its cover and i say something like that um so we're gonna let it rest now no matter what we we need to let food rest anyway so especially meat so it's a really cool thing because we need to let it rest so uh we're going to let it rest about 15-20 minutes in 15-20 minutes we are going to uh paint sear it and we're doing a cast iron pen and really gives it a beautiful crust and uh and and then i'll make a little glaze uh i have a madeira i'm gonna just just deglaze the panda and and make a little glaze and let it rest a few more minutes uh i'm gonna serve it with a fondant potatoes and i already made those potatoes there's a link in there somewhere i'm not sure it's over there or over there it's in there and there's a link we already made this we release them they're fondant potato they're amazing serve them with any potato you want i'm just going to increase the temperature on my on my oven because i added really low obviously a two and a quarter um and we're gonna get here reheat those potatoes three three fifty they were in the fridge we already made them and uh and then that's it so we'll be back in a few minutes let this guy rest about 15-20 minutes that's a really cool thing if you have a dinner party especially if you have a romantic dinner you got to plan the whole thing right and uh and it's perfect you can relax you can have the appetizer you can have more champagne more wine you know and uh and uh and then you'll finish it and right here we're gonna do it few minutes sorry so i'll be back in a few minutes okay friends well these guys rest about 15-20 minutes so i'm gonna seal it i got a cast iron pan then i'm gonna get really really hot 365 is all i really need right here i'm going to do some green beans you see i got regular butter in here and as you can see the milk protein is starting to uh to caramelize a little bit so i'm just going to put them in here like this just regular butter shallots right and and i got green beans i got green and yellow beans we're just going to saute them with a little butter we have a video also where i make green beans with sun dried tomatoes and things this link is over there somewhere you can get it if you want to do a different one than this this is real simple all right so we're going to make sure we're at the right temperature we don't want to go in a cold pen that is for certain and we're going to take our fillet right there and we are going to give it a beautiful seal okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a very simple pen sauce just to get something if you don't want to make a salt if you do want to make a sauce friends there's a lot of sauce recipe on our website on our website on our channel okay if you click on sausage you see there's a bunch of it there's a mushroom sauce that will get great in there there's a lot of sauce in there also when i did a pork tenderloin i made a port wine reduction that would be perfect for this really really beautiful we're going to put a few garlic cloves in there just for flavor yeah it's gonna give a little flavor and then at the end i'm gonna put a little bit of rosemary and thyme and uh really simple i got some madeira i'm just gonna deglaze with a little bit of madeira very very simple okay and little shallots i'm not gonna put them now otherwise they're going to burn i don't want to forget to tell you that it took one hour and 22 minutes for my temperature to get to 122 degree horrid ironic ironic so um but uh you know it could take you anywhere between an hour and 15 minutes and 20 minutes depending on the size my friend depending on the size of it okay so we are going to uh to get a nice seal on it and uh and that's all we want at this point just get a beautiful seal that's all and we're gonna do this take our time there's no rush okay and we're gonna sear the green beans to make sure they're good let me get a spatula here for the green beans right there you see and the green beans are going in and the green beans are cooked they're already cooked in water green and yellow beans i guess they are cooked some of them are too cooked i can see that and all we're going to do is just going to get them hot a little bit that's what we're doing let's uh we're starting to get a nice seal on there in the back of it we are the the mark of the of the grill the garlic is gonna get burned but we don't really care we're not using it i mean we are using it for the flavors and here we have the green beans they're done i put the potato in the oven let me check and make sure they're good yeah they're gonna be perfectly fine the place is getting smoky because uh that's the name of the game it start and i did it in clarify butter yes i told you that already just got to make sure you really get a nice crust and we're gonna use the font and we got in the bottom of this band to do a little wine reduction so i can put now my shallots that i'm gonna use if you don't have shallots you can just put onion it'll work just fine i got enough of a a nice crust around it now i am going to deglaze this with my madeira port wine madeira will work just fine i'm going to put some fresh herbs in there i have a thyme and uh and uh rosemary i'm gonna deglaze that pork wine madeira fortified wine is perfect for this really simple friends nothing complicated i'm going to add a little bit of stock because i love a little bit of stock on there a little bit of broth you don't have to use broth if you don't want to use broth friends but a little stock in there it's gonna make a nice reduction you see very simple beautiful reduction simple simple simple you see and now we're gonna finish it up with butter but if i don't want to lose all of it because i may lose all of it if i reduce it too much i'm going to put a little salt and pepper in there now because you know my stock doesn't have any salt remember right salt i don't have any salt my stock doesn't have any salt so i'm going to put a little bit of a cornstarch in here i mean you can't wait to reduce it down damn it you have nothing left if you want some sauce and right there you got a nice piece of meat you should have some nice sauce to it you see and uh if we do that we're going to put it in here just a little let me get a little whisk friends and then we are ready to eat almost so mama mia i'm going to the wrong drawer there you go there you go just a little bit all i want just is just a little bit let me make sure i get back
