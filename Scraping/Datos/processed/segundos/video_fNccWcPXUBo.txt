friends another fantastic recipe today stay diana an old classic you're gonna love making it i made it very simple today be sure to subscribe to our channel don't forget to ring the bell so you get a notification every thursday and if you like it gives us a thumbs up stay tuned we're going to make that steak right now okay friends stegdayan well that's an old classic i made thousands of those in my restaurant in the old days when we used to do tableside cooking literally thousands this was one of the most popular items on our menu tonight i'm going to make it with a film menu i'm going to show you how to make the classical dish very simple as long as you have your miso plus i always say very simple some of you say yeah yeah he says very simple but it's difficult but it's not all right first thing we're going to do is we're going to we're going to do a little different than i would have downloaded at the restaurant just to show you an easy way to do it at home okay first remember mison plus everything ready before you start cooking that's the secret of enjoying cooking at home don't start cooking until everything is chopped and diced okay we're gonna make it very simple we're gonna make just two little servings so we're gonna put a little bit of onion in there and we're going to saute it and then we're going to cut the meat and we're going to make the sauces you can make the sauce in a uh in a saucepan obviously but i know a lot of you don't have saucepans at home but you know what i should show you what it is so then you know you got it this is a typical saucepan this is what i call the ferrari of the cookware okay this is a it's actually the maya is the brand this is the seven ply uh cookware this is actually a fabulous sauce but not if you're doing a two serving you don't need a saucepan this is when you need in more than four to six serving this is really the the ferraris of the pots is really amazing you know and remember heavier the pot better the quality this is a reduction saucepans it's designed to allow you to do reduction but let's not waste too much time talking about this because we got stuff to do so remember ingredient number one always always always the onion i'm gonna put a little bit of shallots i mean a little bit of butter trust me i will put more butter at the end i have to be careful with the butter unless you're using clarified butter the butter is going to burn because butter has milk milk has protein the protein burns at 250 degrees so if you want to cook something in butter without burning use clarify about it but look i'm not going to waste your time with technical stuff some of you don't really give a damn about the classical stuff the uh the fundamentals of it you just want to cook a nice meal and not worry about it so sometimes i feel like addressing the uh youtube recipe police but tonight they can take a break all right so look i i i love it i guess so many comments oh this is not the way you should call the bowl on your ass you're bologna you don't make it with sausage look make your bolognese with whatever you want to make it i like to make mine with sausage and oh you shouldn't be calling in the bowling ears i call it whatever i want to call it and and you don't like my recipe you know there's a lot of them out there so look guys all right stegda yeah we saute in a mushroom and i turn my heat off well how do you like that not a good idea while you're cooking do not turn the heat off and i haven't drink anything so so what could i use right now to uh get rid of the water in a mushroom you got it salt yes you could use a mushroom salt like a porcini mushroom salt today i'm using a mediterranean sea salt use whatever salts make you happy we want to get rid of all the water in the mushroom it's really really important because water mushrooms are 80 water we want to get rid of the water in a mushroom right so we do that's what we do right now we saute them and we want to make sure there's no water left in the mushroom okay so far so good i haven't done anything complicated right that's the idea i want to make sure i don't make anything too complicated then i got the wish sauce and then i got a little cognac just a little bit you don't have to put a lot and then i got madeira that's fabulous but there is a fortified wine you don't have madeira you could use a port wine you could use a masala wine you know as i am cooking the mushroom i can smell i can smell the um the mushrooms so much more as you are eliminating the water you're intensifying the flavor if you could be here right now you would like wow that smells really really good we are doing some caramelization in here of everything all right we're going to put a a little bit of you can put a little bit of thyme a little bit of targon a little bit of chopped parsley and then we're going to put a bit of garlic this is a chopped garlic that we make it's very important to put the garlic in that sauce right and how long do we cook the garlic for you cook the garlic for as long as it takes to make it fragrant which is a few seconds a little bit of worcestershire sauce that's classical to do so we do it classical that's just the way we'll be making it a little bit of masala wine i mean not masada madeira madeira put a touch of cognac in there not a lot now and we're going to put a little bit of stock i'm using a a beef stock and we're going to let this cook and let it reduce okay we're going to let this reduce and while this is reducing we're going to get into the steaks okay if you could be here right now and smell this smells amazing and so far i haven't done anything complicated right you notice all right let me remove all the stuff i don't need anymore i'll i'll use a little bit of parsley left let me remove all these booze i don't need i just want to try to get a clean area so we can a work we can take out the uh the filet mignon the tenderloin out of the out of the oven no not another oven out of the fridge i got a whole tenderloin there i'm just gonna cut a steak out of this this is the beef tenderloin i already cleaned it i made a video folks on how to use this how to uh how to cut it correctly i made a video on it and uh what i do is i make a roast with this and then i make a row another roast with this and i cut this and i fold it and i tie it and let me tell you i make a beautiful beautiful rose with it but that's not today's video there is another video right there if it's not released it'll be really soon how to clean how to tie how to prepare a whole tenderloin of beef but today we're just going to cook let me reduce that sauce we're just going to cut ourselves a medallion so you cut it as thin or as thick as you want okay this is okay this is up to you all right we're gonna remove it we don't need it let's remove it out of here i actually covered the paper that i need and now what i'm gonna do friends is i am going to pound it all right because the steak diana is a pounded tenderloin okay that's all it is the spandex tenderloin so you take a parchment paper right there and you take a meat pounder if you don't have a filet mignon a tenderloin you can do it with a new york strip a t-bone steak you can do with chicken same exact deal friends same exact deal you can do with chicken i promise you all right look at this look how beautiful that is you see assembled hours maybe a little more oh no not this way yeah that's the paper that's that's that's that's only good if you're cooking possums roadkill raccoons only kidding oh nobody can nobody eats fastems out there right if all i'm saying is if you have to use this whatever it is you don't want to eat it all right so look we're ready so now what we're going to do we're going to pencil those really quick let's make sure the sauce is reduced correctly because that's what we're going to do we're going to take that sauce friends we're gonna reduce it and then we're gonna put butter on it all right so now remember this is very thin steak so we can cook it with a little butter because it's very thin the butter is gonna burn normally but by the time the butter is burning we are there anyway so a little bit of olive oil a little bit of butter and we're going to saute that steak right there coco is was whatever steak you can afford okay i love it to do with the filament and you see it's really really really delicate this is the classical way of doing it we're reducing the sauce in the meantime we're cooking the shallots we're cooking the onion we cook in the mush the mushroom and we're reducing the sauce at the same time okay that's why you put enough stock right there and then we're gonna finish it up with butter and we're gonna put it all over the steak i love it i love that stuff a little bit of pepper and you watch we're gonna wait for the uh for the for the batter to turn light golden brown we're gonna be in a pan like boom in and out of there in no time at all okay and you see look look look look i don't know if you can see right there friends but it's reducing you see it's getting a little thicker it's getting a little thicker let me put almost salt and pepper in there i hate when i finish something and then i get a comment you forgot the salt they were not there eating it but they're complaining that i forgot the sober they're right i forgot the soul the other day i'm making a lemon sauce right and i forgot to put the lemon what the hell kind of a lemon sauce is that without the lemon ah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know when the cameras are rolling and you're trying to do a good job you get confused well i don't know about other people but i get confused i get confused easily these days what are you gonna do what are you
