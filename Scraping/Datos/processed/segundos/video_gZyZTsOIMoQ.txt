I'm going to be cooking a whole chicken today and what I'm going to do is I'm going to make up really nice marinade really nice and spicy marinade it's going to be ten Dori chicken now the first thing I'm going to do it's got yourself a knife I'm just going to make some little cuts there's many places in a chicken as possible the reason we're doing that is because I'm trying to get as much of the marinade in there as possible because I'm actually going to marinate this overnight cook it tomorrow it's going to be absolutely delicious and then I'm going to flip it over just try and poke it wherever you can really every time you poke it you get all those sort of spices going into the chicken there we are I think we've done enough for that then a little time though is the season it with some salt it's going to pop some salt on there give it a bit of seasoning I'm going to wrap that in try and get it everywhere get it into those little holes and then we're going to flip it over and put some more salt on that side and again just pop some salt on this side as well and rub that in so try and get all those flavours in there poke them in the holes so what we're now going to do is to put the chicken aside and we're going to concentrate on doing this really nice marinade now to make the marinade I'm just going to run you through the spices we're going to use now I'm actually going to use a teaspoon sort of when you put sugars in your cup of tea now we're going to use one teaspoon of each of these now the ingredients I've got coriander hot chili powder garam masala cumin and cayenne pepper any other spices I'm going to use I've got again teaspoons half a teaspoon of turmeric I've actually used some paprika there I've got about four to five teaspoons of paprika then I've got some cardamom pods I mean I'm not showing you the husks they call them nothing but the shells what I've done is taken the seeds out and I've crushed them I've also got a piece of ginger there which should just show you it's like a 1 inch piece of ginger just sort of peel it chop it up fine and again four or five medium sized garlic's crushed up little bit of lemon juice we're also going to use some natural light sort of yogurt Greek yogurt and it's unsweetened we don't want salt sweet yogurt I've probably used about four tablespoons for there and again I'm going to put a roughly same amount of single cream next to go in I'm going to put some vegetable oil I'm probably using about one and a half to two tablespoons of the oil then I'm going to squeeze the juice I'm going to use about half a lemon I think it doesn't matter if a few pips going try and cut it will in there and I've got some tomato puree that's a thing and then I'm just going to add all those spices that we've already measured out and talked about all right the lovely ginger the smells are great this is going to be really nice now what we need to do is just to smooth this all get it all mixed in so I'll just stir this until it's all mixed up and then we'll get it set of taste now I'm just going to try that and see how it is just try a little bit out cos that's nice that packs a bit of a punch I'm actually going to just put a little bit of salt give that a stir again but for me I think that's probably about right and next I'm going to do is bring the chicken back so I've got the chicken and we're going to marinate it now I actually going to turn it this way up first and we're just going to basically just pop some of this marinade on and we're going to use our hands and just try and rub it everywhere and you'll find that if you leave this overnight you know all these flavors really go into the meat inside it you know in between the actual skin where we've made all those holes again pull the rest of this on and again we just can wrap this all over but make sure it goes in all these holes try and kind of push it in as well because that's why we made them to get the flavors in there and then we're going to cover this through a bit cellophane leave it overnight and this should be all ready when want to cook it tomorrow so I'm just going to pop a bit cellophane over that top lighting now I'm going to put it in the fridge and I'm going to leave it overnight to really intensify those flavors now incidentally this recipe I'm doing you can also do it on smaller pieces like legs and wings and breasts so you know if you chop your chicken down or you buy bits and pieces use the same marinade and do the same thing so I'm just going to take that out of the way and I'll see you tomorrow it's the next day so I've been marinating like chicken for a good sort of about twelve hours early so just pull the cellophane off there and it smells really good now before I start cooking it all I'm going to do is go just lift this up and all this sort of marinade there just fold them down and I put that back on top so now what I'm now going to do is to put a bit of tinfoil over this so I'm just going to put symbol over it right out and pop it in the oven I've put the chicken in the oven and we're going to cook it for about one and a half hours now temperature-wise 180 degrees Celsius which is about 350 degrees Fahrenheit half way throat going to pull it out and have a look at it there aren't way through the cooking so I'm going to take the chicken out and we're going to have a look at it now take the chicken out get off and for the cooking I'm just gonna have a look smells of absolutely unbelievable smells really delicious look at that looks nice then what I'm going to do is any of those bass and juices that we can get from the bottom I'm actually going to put them back on top so I'm just going to lift this up at one end and if we can get some of those already juices there I just want to put those on top really so base in it and then we're going to put it back in the oven and carry on cooking for the other half so I'm going to put the tinfoil back on and then we're going to put it back in the oven carry on cooking same temperature for another 45 minutes tin foil back on there kind of creates a little album in itself and then pop that back in the oven finish cooking mine been cooking for about one and a half hours so what I'm now going to do is pull it out leave the tinfoil on it and I'm going to leave it to rest for about 15-20 minutes so it's all nice and juicy and succulent so I left my chicken for about 15 minutes the rest just take the tinfoil off now it's got a really nice color really juicy but what we can do some of those juices again we can Basin it even at this day so I'm going to tilt it out and get some of those juices and put it on top I'm just going to lift it up all those juices just pop them on top because that's what this chicken is all about the flavors on this is a really good alternative to your Sunday roast chicken if your family wants to make a bit different or if they fancy curry just make one of these serve up a bit of rice bit salad going to put that a little bit in view I'm just going to trim a little bit off so I'm going to use me knife so you can see we've got a nice succulent meat there I'm just going to try a little bit of that lovely really nice flavors nice spice to it let finish that the off whoo lovely if you decide to make this I really hope you enjoy it as much as I am it's gorgeous just going to put some of that marinade back on top really thanks for watching
