hello sweet team welcome back to my channel this is sweetheart jelly i am so excited to be with you all today and i hope everyone is doing wonderfully well in today's video i share with you all this super easy and delicious kfc style fried chicken that you have been waiting for let's get into it so i begin by cleaning my chicken with some salt and also vinegar so what i have in this bottle is some vinegar i spray it over it i add my salt which will help remove any yellowish skin and also any slime i'll use my hands to rub it which will help clean it very well and then i'll transfer it into the sink to get off any slimy mess and yellowish skin and then we will move on to the next step [Music] [Music] [Music] sushi and pastries [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] once it's nicely washed we'll transfer it into a bowl and using a knife we'll poke some holes to ensure that our marinade penetrates beautifully we'll then go ahead and season it with some salt black pepper onion powder [Music] garlic powder ginger powder parsley flakes thyme ground onis chicken seasoning and some paprika we'll rub everything together beautifully so that each chicken is well coated with some of our marinade and you can keep this in your refrigerator overnight but we do not have overnight today so we'll just allow it to marinate for about two hours while that is going on we'll go ahead and prep our coating by adding some flour into a bowl to that some chicken seasoning garlic powder onion powder ginger powder paprika we're gonna mix everything together we nearly forgot our cornstarch so we'll add that and mix it well by now our chicken is well marinated so it is time for us to fry but i always like to separate them by sizes so the smaller ones will go in together and the bigger ones will go in that way they will cook at the same time you don't want some of it to finish cooking before others will then transfer our chicken into our coating and ensure that it is well coated after coating it we're going to go ahead and drop it into some cold water but be sure to shake off any excess flour you do not want too much flour this is perfect you drop it leave it in there for about a minute before we will come back get it out and coat it for a second time if you're making a lot feel free to drop them all in the water you don't have to do it one by one as i'm doing okay so after the second coating which you know you would drench it very well but still shake off any excess and drop it gently into our hot oil and we will fry this on medium heat cover it yes that is the kfc secrets okay now if you prefer to use egg wash instead of water just break one egg into a bowl whisk it and then go ahead and add in some milk whisk everything together and instead of dropping your chicken into the water you can go right ahead and drop it into this egg and milk mixture or you can use just eggs but trust me the water works just as well no flavor lost but some of us that love sweet things must be extra with it but those of you that are lactose intolerant and do not like milk feel free to use the water as your bestie and will coat before dropping it into the milk and egg mixture the same process okay but we are back to check on our chicken and look at it oh my goodness it looks absolutely beautiful now let me tell you the secret okay at kfc they fry these babies in a pressure cooker so i could have done that but i want you to know that you can use your regular pot at home cover it up and you will still get the same results this helps your chicken cook through and through all right and i repeat the frying process until everything is nicely fried up now back to covering our frying chicken don't worry about it becoming soggy trust me it'll be nice crispy crunchy but the inside will be well cooked so let's go check the crunchiness right about now did y'all hear that super crunchy dip it in our homemade sauce listen again i told you now this is not blood okay let me open it up so y'all can see that it's fully cooked some people thought my chicken was not cooked look it is cooked to the bone my baked chicken was cooked as well for some reason i don't know if it's my camera making this look red but trust me it is well done and our kfc style chicken is ready have it on your easter table okay and your guests would love it thank you so so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and are inspired to try the recipe until i see you in the next one stay safe keep loving each other and remember that the love of god and family is life's greatest blessing and guys [Music] bye
