can I be cooking up a piece of pork loin today and get a beautiful crackling on there now a little while ago I did a video for a pork loin with crackling the thing is I didn't really give measurements or weights or temperatures in the ovens hopefully we're going to cover all that in this video now the first thing is I got this from the butchers and he's actually scored the top of it so what that means is you kind of if you haven't got your scored already asked your book to do it but you just grab it like this and you go down and what you do is you cut into the fat but not into the meat if you cut into the me then it's going to make it dry so you go around hold your hand firmly with the knife and just score it away of a sharp knife until you've cut all these little slits in it and now we'll end up making a beautiful crackling now when you cook your pork loin it's important to have the skin really nice and dry because if you've got nice dry skin it will make beautiful crackling now also when I got it from the butchers I asked them to charring it which is if I just lift this out further back there you know separated the meat from the bone so that just makes it easier for carving later on so I've got the pork loin there it's already timed and Taulbee scored then what we're going to do is put a little bit of oil and some sea salt on there now with the oil you can use any oil you like vegetable oil some primal or on it on now I've got a bit of sort of to mix really of olive oil and sunflower oil just going to put a little bit on tissue because I don't want to put too much oil you just want to put a little bit give it a rub on the outside this all again helps to sort of crisp burn it all out and also help us the salt to stick to it so just put the oil on there obviously you could just do you reach your hands and rub it in but don't put too much oil they get it thoroughly covered all over lips is I've got some see some sounds that I put some in up there and start off by spring on it and then we're just gonna carefully see if we can wrap this all in if you can try and wrap it into those little slits we've made now I'm also going to put some black pepper on there so I'm just going to throw that we need all these sort of things besides really bound wrap this in now I'm going to flip it over and I'm just going to put in a little bit of salt there and it's ready to go in there now next of all I've got an onion I'm just going to shut them off and I'm just going to place those in the bottom there does that make a really lovely gravy later also I tend to put some water in the top my mine the reason I do that is it helped to prevent the pork from shrinking level so when you buy your pork loin from the butchers on the skin if you learnt your crackling if you can have a little bit extra and you know they sort you out they cut piece off there because what I find sometimes especially if you've got a lot of guests around and they all laugh the crackling it just means there's plenty for everyone so you know you can ask him he won't charge you anything for that so get yourself some extra salt pork skin to make the crackling and you'll have loads of pork crackling so we're ready to go now I'm just going to tell you how much this way I'm going to cook it for now whichever pork loin you've got what you want to do is give it a kickstart bit of a boost for 25 minutes just to start it off now to start with 25 minutes I'm going to put it a higher temperature and we're going to put it in a 240 degrees Celsius 475 Fahrenheit which is Get Smart rolling so once you've given it a kick start by cracking on its way then you want to reduce the temperature down now we're then going to reduce the temperature down to 190 degrees Celsius 375 Fahrenheit gas mark 5 now time of cooking that depends on the wine now mine weighs three and a half pounds the formula I use is for every pound of weight you want to cook for 35 minutes so this one weighs three and a half pounds so it's three and a half times 35 minutes which actually comes out 120 minutes it's two hours so I'm in Italy 25 minutes give it a boost at a higher temperature and then we're going to do another two hours at the slightly lower temperature and at the end of it you should have beautiful crackling and really nicely done me never got better they are there for cooking the pork loin and it's looking good in the oven now I've gotten two grams potatoes sort of cooking away there and I'm also going to put the other bit of the pork skin to make some extra pork crackling now I've got the temperature of his top oven again at 190 degrees Celsius the same temperature is the the pork loins cooking at the moment so leave it all cooking make sure you top up the water and the pork loin if you need to now it's about the large 20 minutes cooking its pork loin now with the crackling if you get a bit worried that it's not go noise exactly what you came through for say last 15 or 20 minutes just turn the heat right up to maximum just to give it a really good quick boot so for the last sort of 15 20 minutes I'm just going to turn right up to maximum and get out crackling to bursting so I'll finish cooking the pork loin look at that last 15 minutes 20 minutes on the Pooh's maximum temperature really kind of christened a pan pour crackling so let's take that out and put it on the table look whip delish delish so I'll just take the full going from out in the oven I've transferred it onto a plate the readout crackling that is going to be absolutely delicious then what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to let this tenderize so we're going to leave it for a good 20 30 minutes before we sort of tuck into it now I'm also I'm going to get that other crackling that I found cooking in the oven for about an hour so I'm going to pull that out again put it on the same tray and then I'm just going to cover it all in tinfoil so let's found probably up practically now that's
