hello everyone in today's video we're making a simple and delicious whiting fish recipe it requires very few ingredients and this is such a flavorful and delicious fish it's one of my favorites if you'd like to see how i make this please stay tuned [Music] i am starting off with three fillets of whiting fish i have patted these dry on both sides and i'm going to add a little bit of olive oil as you can see i poured a little too much on that first fillet so i'm just going to take my brush and just kind of spread that amongst the three fillets [Music] i have thoroughly coated all three pieces of the fish with olive oil both on both sides and now i will add my seasoning i will now start seasoning both sides of the fish i am using lowry seasoning salt i'll add a little bit of onion powder as well as garlic powder and black pepper i'm repeating the process on the other side of the fish using the same seasonings on the top of the fish i'm gonna also add parsley flakes [Music] [Music] i'm now using the back of a spoon to kind of massage the ingredients into the fish i typically use my hands and put on gloves but i'm out of gloves today so i'm just using this spoon here i will now transfer my fish over to a baking sheet and i have lined it with foil and here i'm just adding three but i decided to pretty much double this amount um my husband wanted some fish too so i just added what you see here three more so this is all ready to be put into a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes it has been 20 minutes and i have removed the fish from the oven it smells heavenly and this is the outcome guys i hope you'll try this it is such an easy dish great for you know weeknight and very healthy as well so we're trying to stick to more fish recipes here so i hope you enjoyed this video don't forget to comment like and subscribe and i'll see you in the next one bye
