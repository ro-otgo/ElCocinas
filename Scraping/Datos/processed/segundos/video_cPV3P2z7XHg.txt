bell so every thursday you get a notification when i put out a new video and please subscribe we love to have you subscribe to our channel thanks for watching you're going to love making this recipe here we go okay friends well this is a redo we're going to redo a recipe than we did about eight years ago on youtube uh and uh it was shot with old technology so now we got four k's so we're gonna do the recipe but it's a good thing because uh it's gonna be even a better recipe uh and it's gonna have a little history attached to it because uh in eight years then that old recipe was post we certainly got some feedback from everybody from uh the dishes from russia and now it's from france no it's from poland now it's from god i heard it from every country well i'll tell you a little story in a minute tell you exactly where it comes from but let me get going uh because when you make a big beef stroganoff you can certainly make it with a t-bone steak you can make it with the new york shrimp then you can slice thin and you can make it really fast or you can make it with a chuck roast and if you can't get chuck roast then you can get the stew meat and you can get at the butcher shop or you can this is a chuck roast and i cleaned up uh and and we're going to do it it's very simple i mean it's simple it requires a little prep as you can see all my recipe requires a little prep by the way and a quick note for those of you that have never seen my uh my uh uh channel first uh this is not a quick recipe one two three it's a recipe then if you have your mison plus and you're ready we can do it together at the same time it's real cooking it's not like a tic tac taco they don't even target they do like a two and three second recipe and uh a little voice over and you go ahead and and you figure it out well here i'm doing it with you uh so if you want to uh make you have your mison plus ready that means everything chopped and that's ready to go then we can do it together so i hope you have it you can download the recipe on our website print it get your museum plus ready and then come back and we'll do it together so we have a a fry pan going and we also have a a pot an enamel caster and pot that i'm gonna cook the stew in okay first thing we're gonna do is we're going to saute some onion and we're going to saute the beef i already got some sauteed right here that i did earlier to save some time i'll talk about that in a little while but let me first get going number one thing we're going to do is uh uh we're gonna saute the onion and and the onion remember the onion is always first always first doesn't matter whether you're cooking doesn't matter if you're making a soup if you're making a stew if you're making a sauce i don't care what you're making the onion is always number one that's gotta remember that and and and you don't put anything with it i don't care if you having uh celery and carrots and leeks and whether you don't put them at the same time whenever you see somebody putting the garlic and all the vegetables at the same time with the onion i highly recommend you go to the playboy channel maybe you learned something nah i didn't say that so uh we're gonna saute the onion and then we're going to saute the beef we got to make sure the the fry pan is super hot i'm looking at like 365 and i'm going to saute the beef and uh and this is very important it doesn't matter if you're making if you're doing it with a the only thing that matters is cooking time if you're doing it with a a a new york strips or if you're doing it with another meat you have to cook a very short amount of time but if you're doing it with a chuck roast which i think is one of the best meat to do a stew with um is you want to really really take the time to caramelize the meat so first we're gonna put a little salt and pepper on both dish right measure carefully the salt and pepper right there i can hear the recipe police from youtube oh he's not measuring hey cooking is not rocket science folks we're not sending a man on the moon we're just making a little bit too so it's okay if it's at all different every time we make it it doesn't really matter i'm going to move this stock a little bit out of the way so right here why are we doing this let's talk a little bit about this like i said this is a recipe then then i teach you along you know i've been doing this for 50 years and in 50 years you'll be amazed how many things i've heard or i've learned throughout the years so it's a it's a wonderful opportunity for me to be able to teach you the reason why we're doing this right here friends is uh we really want to brown the meat i try not to put too much uh meat in the pan so they don't crowd each other it doesn't you're not stewing the meat it really wouldn't matter that much if we did it in this case because that meat's going to require two and a half hours of cooking time so if if it stays a little bit too long and a flight pattern it really doesn't matter what we want what we want friends is to create right here this mala reaction i hope you can see this right there you see that that mala reaction right there this is the carmelization of protein and this friends is super super important flavor i mean really really really important flavor also you know i have a another youtube recipe on um on youtube that's where you get youtube recipe it's my beef stew it's very similar to this a different wine a different kind of cooking method but it's very very similar to this so if you like to be student you should check out a beef stew recipe also it's a wonderful recipe i'll tell you right so remember now we are satin on you you see what i'm talking about right the carbonization right there friends i hope you can see it right there i'm moving across to the camera not sure if we can get a close look out of this but and orlais macaroli but it's very important that we take the time to do this this is flavor friends clever flavor flavor flavor we really got to do this okay so let's look at what we got here we got caramelized onion you see you see caramel donut that's what i was looking for caramelized onion okay look very very simple right we're gonna put some fresh thyme and then we're going to saute our mushrooms all right a mushroom what a mushroom made out of water water is the enemy we want to get rid of all the water we want to get rid of all the water in the mushroom because mushrooms are full of water and i don't like the texture of it you know a lot of people don't don't like mushroom it's not that they don't like mushroom flavor they just don't like the texture of it so we're gonna get rid of it all okay holy mackerel this is very hot this is what i'm looking for right there actually i'm good i am really good right here you see this is all that caramelization right here look how beautiful that is friends if you could be here right now smell you were like oh man can i ate some of that well you certainly can you can come back and eat some of my food right there look at this you know what we're going to do friends we're going to deglaze that pan [Music] we're going to deglaze that pan right there i'm scrubbing it right there i am scraping what we call the phone the phone f-o-n-d that's the combination of the protein in the bottom of the fry pan right there it's going to be delicious oh so let's get rid of the water in the mushroom one more thing friends the mushrooms i sauteed the mushrooms i sauteed the mushrooms i mean i'm sorry i cut them in quarters whenever you're braising a mushroom that means you're going to be cooking it in a wet environment submerged with liquid you want to quarter them or six them or ate them if they're very big because they maintain a better texture okay so if you slice them and you cook them for two and a half two two and a half hours they're gonna be nothing so it's really really important then you take the time to do this okay now could you do everything in the same pan at home you probably could do all this in the same pan you probably could do all this in the same pen let me remove some other stuff i don't need and then i'm going to start to be able to put some ingredient also in a minute garlic by the way folks garlic i have a video to show you how to smash your garlic no not to smash how to make a garlic puree but if you haven't seen it this is an easy way to do right there you just smash it on the board right because you got to put our garlic in there right and then we're just going to chop it fine you just chop it fine [Music] and we don't have to chop it too fine because you see it's gonna cook for two and a half hours so we don't need to worry too much about it having it too fine here's a small one right there so i'm gonna put all this back in there because i'm not ready for the garlic i just wanted to prepare it so i have it right there ready let's see how we're doing with everything okay the beef i stopped it for a minute i'm good let me see if all the water is out of my mushroom this is doing pretty good it's doing very good friends all right we're gonna put a little bit of tomato puree very little okay very very little because my beef stew already got tomato in there might be stuck so we don't need a lot we're going to put the garlic and how long do we cook the garlic for we cook it however long it takes to release fragrance and as soon as you smell your garlic you're going to put some liquid on it be strong enough believe it or not folks got white wine not red wine classical recipe i'll talk about this in a minute all right because there's uh there is a uh a youtube recipe police i don't know where they get the information from sometimes when i hear the comment they make mamma mia carrots diced carrots we're gonna let those cook for a minute we're gonna let the wine reduce for a minute it's very important when you're putting wine to let it reduce now let me stop for a second and tell you a couple things number one a classical beef stroganoff and i mean classical as per if you know i'm one of those this is for chefs okay it's not something you wanna i was gonna put it on my counter but hold on hey this is not the kind of book then um my counter has got little stuff on it i don't want to put my book on it is the bible for chefs if you will okay it's a it's a real dictionary for chefs okay and and if you don't sometime where a recipe come from and i heard so many different things about where the strawberry come from everybody got an idea oh i come from there i come from there in the meantime i'm letting the white wine reduce so i'm not killing too much time i just wanted to explain it okay now the ingredients in by the way it's it's it's troganov it's the right spelling of the word it's not shrugging off but if we call it stroganoff nobody knows what that is but that's the real name of it and and according to the larus gastronomic which is the bible of of all chefs all over the world the story goes in the according to the to the book another book or so-called a test of russia the original beef stroganoff recipe derived from a basic french mustard for seasoning beef combined with the dollop of of russian sour cream so whether the recipe recipe comes from he says accept the story of the beef stroganoff is an a french chef called charles briere which is almost like my last name i have nothing to do with charlotte i don't know is who worked for a wealthy sem pistol saint-petersburg family created this dish for a cooking contest in 1891 and he won the contest and he named the uh the dish after his employer and his employer was was the count patel alexandrovich stroganoff and that's the dude that's the dude i took a picture of it to show you but of course i can't open it but that's the dude right there so jack is gonna put a nice picture of it on the screen so you guys can see who he is but that's the dude and the ingredients are very simple okay those are the classical ingredients right there the beef changes depends what it is you want to do but if you want to do just a plain beef 2 we're going to take it right there friends look and you know what we're going to do all that goodie down there we're going to deglaze it with a little bit of white wine all right we're gonna deglaze it right there a little bit of white wine and another thing that tells you the classical way of doing it is then you would um marinate the uh uh the the beef overnight with uh white wine and carrots and bay leaf and celery overnight you would marinate but you know what who's got time to do this okay i think it'll be perfectly fine as long as we cook at the right time look look my fried pan right there i got all that goodies in there right now i'm going to take the beef then i sauteed this afternoon oh one of them went on went on the floor there's no dog here in the studio so we're gonna put in the garbage oh man this is that so we're gonna put it all right there all right let me take my book out of here before it gets so messed up and then we're gonna put a little bit of brown sugar very little very little brown sugar right and i'm gonna show you a cool trick if you've seen my beef stock recipe you've seen the trick you know what it is and now we're gonna put the stock okay so this is of course a beautiful stock and and not everybody's got access to a beautiful stock like this uh you know i run a professional school and kitchen so it's easy for us to do but so what do you do at home you can buy a good beef beef stew beef broth if you see one in the store then it's very nice the problem is there's not many places where you can get a good beef broth so if you wanted to start from scratch you can i have an old recipe on youtube which we're going to reshoot eventually but right now it's pretty good it's a beef stew recipe then you have a few dish type chef jumpier beef stew you'll see it's really wonderful in fact that's the recipe that's the recipe right there that's that's my beef stew recipe than you have on youtube but if you don't want to go through this um this will work to do this you can start you can buy a beef broth then it's decent you know try a few of them to see which one you like right beef broth and then you can add some tomato paste to it and cook it for a little while and if you have some extra leeks carrot celery and onion or meat trimming you can put it in there and let it cook for a while and then you you portion it in in like eight to 10 12 16 ounce container whatever you got and you can freeze it you know lasting your freezer forever and then you got a beautiful beef stock because at the end of the day friends the stock makes a very very big difference okay so now we're going to thicken this now another thing you could do you can do so many things you can make a roof and thicken with the roof but a lot of you don't have time to make a rule right so you can put flour in there and i see a lot of people mixing and mixing flour with water mamma mia please don't do that and they do it at the end you got to put the flour at the beginning so it has time to cook and so we're going to do it now uh for those of you that have seen my uh my uh bish2 recipe you know what i'm going to do but for those of you that have not seen it i'm going to scare you oh what happened if i did that no no no not so good so we're not going to do that we're going to take a strainer all right we're going to put the strainer in in the stew okay and we're going to thicken this with flour like i said if you have a root by all mean roux equal amount of flour equal amount of butter it's best if you use a clarified butter but for those of you that don't cook you want to make it easy and that's the whole idea of my channel it's for you to be able to cook fabulous food but it's easy to make so far i haven't done anything you cannot do right so now we're going to take a little flour i try to make it easy and then take this right there look and mix it up you see you see look look look look how easy the flower incorporates you don't even see it right well let me tell you something no lumps is ever going to be created this way you see so here we go we're going to take this we're going to put a little more flour in here because it needs just a little bit more and we're just going to go in like this you see we're going to mix it up and it's going to incorporate it as long as you just mix it you see look and if you don't have enough it doesn't makes just go deeper that's all let me turn the heat off a little bit because it's really getting hot in there you see look and the idea is to incorporate all the flour and you want to do this at the beginning of the cooking process friends you don't want to wait the end you want to do this at the beginning of the cooking process because at the end if you do it at the end the flour doesn't have time to cook okay look all right so now you see you watch what's gonna happen and you want to kind of like let's let it loose a little bit you see and then we're going to finish this with uh we're going to cook some beautiful egg noodles and and then we're going to put the sour cream and the chives to finish it up this is going to be delicious this is going to require about two two and a half hours to cook because we're using chuck roast if you were to use a another meat then you would cook it a lot less you you would cut it a little different you would cut it in strips but this right there friends is absolutely beautiful you see look we're gonna let it cook and then we're gonna finish it up later with uh uh let me put a little more salt and pepper in there a little and salt and we're just gonna cook with adjust the salt and pepper till the end but this friends it's gonna be absolutely wonderful and like i said we're gonna serve it with a large egg noodle maybe a papadella maybe a fettuccine and we'll put that in the bottom of the plate and then we're gonna put it on top with uh sour cream and chives it's gonna be delicious and that's it that's the um classical you know what we'll do we'll put a description of it i'll spill the uh la rus gastronomic on on the website on a recipe so when somebody ask you where that dish come from you at least you have an educated opinion all right we'll be back when it's all cooked after two two and a half hours okay well here we are we cook it about two and a half hours uh it's uh wonderful already nice and soft i can tell so at this point there's a few things we need to do one we need to put a little dijon mustard in it because it's uh it's traditional you put dijon and and don't worry about cooking mustard okay a lot of people oh mamma mia look at this a lot of people um cook they are mustard you don't need to cook the mustard okay you really do not need to cook the mustard as my fact it's best if you don't cook the mustard okay there's no reason to cook it all right so here we go mix the mustard a little bit now at this point you can put a little bit of sour cream in there and a little bit of sour cream on top it's up to you what you want to do i'm going to put just a little bit of sour cream in here like this just a little bit of sour cream because it is nice a bit strong enough it's got a little bit of creaminess to it all right so we just mix it up really good nice all right and then we're going to serve it with a papadela pasta a large noodle a fettuccine is good whatever you want whatever whatever pasta you want you can even serve it with a with uh with a potatoes but you know it's kind of traditional to serve it with a with a pasta but serve it with whatever makes you happy and i say it's cooking it's not a rocket science right so be cooking with whatever is happy i put i did it the papadela pasta right there and uh and and i just put a little bit of butter on there it's surprised and put a little butter in there right and it's very easy all i do is i cook the pasta right and when they're a little bit al dente it's still a little bit of dente and then i take um uh a little bit of powder when they come out i drain it i keep a little bit of the water because i don't really mind the water or pasta right and and then i put a little bit of butter in there that's why we got this beautiful shine on it right okay so now what we're going to do we're going to take it we're going to take some of that beautiful stew right there we're going to put it right in the middle of it just right like that we'll try to keep the uh the the uh the meat in the middle of it if we can so we don't dirty the plate and uh and the noodle around it okay put as much or as little as you want all right this is very simple dish friends okay and if you mess up the plate like i just did right there you just clean it up okay don't be out there serving dirty plates now remember the plate is a bigger the plate more of a canvas you have right and then what we do we take a little bit of the sour cream just a little bit of the sour cream and you put it on top you don't have to put the sour cream on top if you don't want to you know it's your dish make it however you want it put a little bit of chives on there friends look at this look at see how simple that is right there let me tell you friends i know i dare this uh youtube recipe police is gonna say that's not a stroganoff caller whatever you wanna call my friends but this is the classical stroganoff as per remember as per the larus gastronomic okay we have to have some kind of a bubble chefs and this is our bubble right there okay so friends this is wonderful you're gonna make this recipe i know you're going to love it
