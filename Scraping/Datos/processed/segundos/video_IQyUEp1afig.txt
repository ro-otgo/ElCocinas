hi I'm chef Raphael and welcome to another episode of cooking with Chef Crawford I sure that's meant to make you a better home cook today I'm going to show you a delicious recipe of making fried tilapia let's get started to be honest if you start marinating this fish putting herbs and spices they'll all be washed away in their cooking on so the most important thing you need to have is a fresh fish and salt I'll also add some black pepper but not for the fish how do you know your fish is fresh the first thing is the smell so you need to smell your fish and it should actually smell fresh and fishy now the other way you know that it's fresh is as you look at the I say I should not be cloudy another way you can also tell the fish is fresh or not with other gills now if the gives a red reddish or pinkish in color and they don't have a foul smell that fish is fresh but one thing I like doing whenever I'm doing fried fish is removing the gills and I usually feel I don't actually need them so like that so because this bottom side is actually attached to the tongue you just need to pull it and by the way you can have your fish wherever you're buying a fish you can have them remove it for you I like removing this fin you can either use scissors or a small sharp knife you cut into three sections now depending on the size of your fish the reason why we do that is so that when we add the salt the salt would actually penetrate into the flesh of the fish and then we put a generous amount of salt and then this is optional like I say that like using it I'll add some black pepper so that's it now fish is ready for frying no need for lemon juice because to be honest if you put lemon juice in advance still and you're going to dip right I would say it's actually useless you need the lemon juice when you're eating the fish when the fish is already cooked the other thing that you need is good cooking oil now cooking oil P I'm using a vegetable cooking oil usually when I'm deep-frying amplify using that as opposed to sunflower oil or corn oil with sunflower sunflower oil it were expensive with the boil makes more sense for me so learn for the oil to get hot just make sure that all the excess water is dripped off and then deep into the oil with the tail and leave [Music] [Applause] you actually know the fish is ready when it's nice and brown like this and for this size took about ten minutes so the fish is ready and like I said we're Savin each day in Kenya we love it with a garden and skooma on greens when it's bit fried it's actually still soft and dry and remember on top of the lemon this is when you actually add the lemon and just squeeze and the fish will be more tasty so that's your dish for today Gani up with some greens and some pride to make sure you subscribe to the channel so that you'll be notified to never have a new recipe out till next time goodbye [Music]
