channel ring that Bell stay tuned we're making it right now [Applause] okay friends let me show you how easy it is for me to make this delicious chili I got a spicy Italian sausage and I got a ground short ribs you can use um 80 20. uh ground beef then you buy the grocery store so I got I started with the onion I got a big onion I'll tell you when I made it big onion I made a big onion look at ammonium I'm using beautiful Spanish uh yellow onion look look we're gonna put the ground beef in here friends then I'll tell you about everything I said I'm just going to saute that to create that nice Maya reaction to get some brownie that's so important friends I see people making chilies they stew the beef they stew it don't ever stew it you wanna um uh so dead he got a beautiful golden brown and I'm going to do the same thing with the sausage and as I say we're going to put a little bit of the uh uh the um a garlic olive oil you know just a little bit and we're going to Brown this and this right here the onion we're going and we're gonna get some nice caramelization plants you see very important friends they will get some nice caramelization otherwise it'll be like stew and the sausage I'm gonna break it up this my friends is the most important thing you can do right there right there I buy a spicy Italian sausage sausage um most good Italian Market will ever but most grocery store have it um I'm not so sure I want to buy the regular grocery store but uh if you have an Italian Market in your neighborhood they're usually pretty good with this so we're gonna Brown the meat we're gonna burn the meat because uh that create that Maya reaction I was telling you about and that's key they make a good chili friends then we're gonna have some beans we're gonna put some cannellini beans some kidney beans some red beans and then we're gonna get this golden brown now this is very spicy already but I'm still gonna put some uh I got a secret ingredient not secret anymore now because I'll tell you you guys are the best you know let me tell you I tell all my friends that I chef than a retire or a better retired say you know you've been cooking for 30 40 50 years there's so many chefs and I've been doing this their whole life I said it's time for you to share all that knowledge then you have acquired with a YouTube start your own channel and uh and a lot of them are gonna do be doing it I'm inviting every Chef I did there is a professional chef style your own YouTube channel people want to learn what you got in your head and you'll want to share it with everybody it's amazing when you think about the platform right so look the most important thing you want to do and you see so many people violate that don't let them caramelize the meat all right friends it's gonna take me a few minutes because this I really want to do it right so I'm gonna do it let me talk real quick about the ingredient I don't want to miss it I got celery cut very small carrots small Boon ones tomato puree fresh thyme cumin little chili paste powder cilantro or parsley and I got a hot a chili pepper garlic and my dear friends you can get it in the can it's a Chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce oh that stuff my friends it's so hot you have to be careful this is a can right there I used a little bit I mostly use the Adobo sauce and uh just a couple of spoon of this is enough this is enough for the whole church okay if you're gonna cook for the whole church you're going to use the whole thing but you need at least three 400 people okay you can never use the whole can I always forget about it nobody's going to eat it no no I promise you nobody's gonna eat it because it's gonna be too hot we want a spicy but delicate okay now see we don't have any color yet then I got the beans right there I'm using the uh the Goya bean I love Goya bean I think they do a fabulous job because they're still very firm years ago I would have never thought of using a can in a in a I mean a bean in the can because they were mushy today I don't know how they did it but they know how to do it correctly and uh and I joined them sometimes I use a little bit of that water because it's a nice starchy water but sometime I don't I got some tomato in there I got a 28 ounce can of uh tomatoes and uh so I'm gonna put all this together and let me continue sorting this for a minute my friends oh I got a little brown sugar also to have said if we have a little bit of acidity from from the tomatoes just a little bit sometime because they're not going to cook that long um if we have a little bit of acidity then the brown sugar is going to help us on the brown sugar it's a dark brown sugar it's not as um not a sweet that's regular sugar I wanted to show you real quick folks you see right here this is what I'm looking for right there see right there I hope Jack can show them right there I'm sure you can see it you see this is what we're looking for right here folks see I'm looking for the caramelization right there I don't care what you do yeah okay anything you do you're using ground meat or ground sausage friends you gotta get the Maya reaction okay really really important oh yeah baby this is gonna be delicious how are we doing here we're doing good it's starting over here all right I continue doing this I'll be back in a couple of minutes when it's all done okay okay friends see it took a few moments I want to show you see right there friends this is what you're looking for okay that colonization it's a mustard it's a must-have now the beef didn't caramelize as much we stay we still we got some nice flavor we got some nice gum not as much because what happened is then the pot is stolen some of the moisture stays on top of it you see in the fry pan so if you're gonna caramelize something you're doing it perfect do it in a fry pan instead of doing it in a in a pot okay so you see right there much much better right okay so now we're gonna take some uh some of the carrots I'm gonna take some of the celery some of it about the whole thing not that big of a deal just a little container in here I'm not sure how many ounces that is but we're gonna mix all this up this is very simple recipe my friends it's simple the a little prep that's all remember break down the cake the carrot the carrot break down the carrot sometimes I wonder about myself break down the the sausages you don't want a big piece of sausage you want it to be crumbed crumble see right there beautiful beautiful all right here we go put it all in there now you see now of course can you do it in one part yeah you can do the whole thing in one part maybe nothing wrong with that nothing wrong doing it in one part friends nothing wrong with doing it all in one part just takes a little longer that's all and uh and and for the purpose of this video I don't want it to be too long all right so now we're gonna put a little bit of tomato puree there's a little bit of tomato puree I'm gonna cook this just for a second yeah and then we're gonna put a 28 ounces of the tomatoes and what I did I squeezed them I squeeze them in my hands yeah I squeeze them all right now let's put some flavoring in there friends all right let's not forget nothing usually I'm always forgetting something I could have put the garlic a few minutes ago this is a lot of garlic it looks like it but it's not that much you want a nice big healthy tablespoon of garlic I should have put it just a little earlier earlier I make mistakes so I can explain it um a little bit of the chili pepper you can pass you can skip this if you don't want it uh a little bit of a parsley or cilantro the chili powder so remember this is a matter of opinion how hot do you want it cumin cumin cumin is some magic about cumin it really is and then um a fresh Time Fresh time fresh Time Fresh time very important my friends the fresh timer and now now my friends we are going to put our uh chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce be careful with this thing just like look one two oh that's enough I mean I like a little spicy deep but the the smokiness the flavor then the Adobe the uh chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce give you my friends oh my Lord this is heaven this is really heaven so I have a little bit of the beef stock that I'm gonna put just a little bit of the beef stock I don't want to put too much yet I can always add more okay I can always add more my friends but I think that's going to be enough right there now we're gonna put the beans so cannellini beans if you don't like beans it's not a recipe for you there are red beans right there friends and this is a a white kidney beans and we'll decide in a minute we're gonna decide in a minute friends if we are indeed going to put some of that water from the beans I love a lot of beans so I hope you like beans too that's a lot of beans I love it to me this is like a an amazing chili you can also add some bacon in there too you can saute some bacon and add it to it and now what we're gonna do friends we're gonna cook this slowly and it's going to release more liquid we're gonna cook it slowly for about uh 30 minutes and we're going to see what happened so we're going to do it very slowly and then we'll adjust the seasoning of it and uh we're gonna have a self an amazing chili so I'll be back in a few minutes when this is nicely cooked down and we're testing and we'll adjust it accordingly be back in a few minutes okay friends 45 minutes perfect timing and look at look how beautiful that looks it's gonna be delicious so you can sprinkle a little bit of parsley in here to give you or the or a cilantro whichever one you want to put just to give you some nice fresh bright color to it I added some of the water from the beans one of them uh it's up to you how much liquid you put in it all depends how thick you want it you see and uh and there's my friends looks absolutely gorgeous you see this is perfect now so far I've not missed my uh serving Bowl and uh now there's I have to say six million ways to serve that obviously and what I like to do friends I'll take a little bit of the sour cream and I mix it with uh uh with a little bit of heavy whipping cream and uh and I'm just gonna put a little bit of it just just a little bit just like this just like this right just a little bit and then I'm going to put uh a little more sour cream in the middle and they can put it with a ice cream scoop that I forgot to take a uh a small one I don't want to take a big big one I put an ice cream scoop right there in the middle right and then so we're looking good and uh and then we're gonna put some uh some cheese I got some cheddar cheese in there friends cheddar cheese cheddar cheese yeah whatever cheese you want to put in here it's up to you but cheddar is kind of like cool with it and then a little bit of chopped uh uh green onion right there and you have yourself a chili that I promised you friends it's going to be amazing I promise you it's going to be amazing and and I like the sour cream because it cuts down a little bit of the heat from it just enough you see and this is going to be hot so be careful don't burn yourself you may have to wait a little bit oh oh you know what I love the most about um oh I'm gonna eat that whole thing what I love the most about is a little crunchiness of the coyotes in the celery the the soft consistency of the beans the heat from the chipotle pepper everything is present without being too much friends I hope they make this is going to become one of your favorite chili recipe I promise you I hope you make it remember thumbs up you like the video subscribe to that channel and by all mean ring that Bell we'll see you in the next couple of days another fantastic video
