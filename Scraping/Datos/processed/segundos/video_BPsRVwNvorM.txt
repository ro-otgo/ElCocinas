well hello there friends fantastic video today i'm going to show you how to make the most tender the most delicious skirt steak with the chimichurri sauce stay tuned i'm going to show you how to do it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel then ring that bell stay tuned we're making right now together [Applause] well hello there friends let me show you how easy it is to do this and if we're going to marinate a meat a piece of meat scotch steak friends is the piece to do look how big that is and this is actually a lot of people cut it the wrong way so they find it not to be very tender but this is actually very tender the secret is to cut it against the grain and i'll show you how to do that but right now what we're going to do we're going to marinate it first of all if we're going to buy a skirt steak you want to buy a one from the outside the skirt steak comes from the in the front of the animal in the in the belly in the itself in the plate um just behind the bliss where the brisket is which is in the front of it they know in the back there's a plate over the belly and it's in front of the belly and it's the outside you want to get and uh and and it's uh it looks like a a lot of fat in there we love that fat that fat is going to give us a lot of flavors it's going to help us penetrate it and sometimes they're quite thick this is a really nice thick piece and we're going to do we're going to cut it in pieces so then when we slice it we're going to slice it with the grain it's really simple not difficult at all i'm going to show you how to do it but this if you're going to marinate a piece of meat this is the piece of meat you want to marinate so we're going to cut it in about the size then we can handle to cut it a sideways so this is gonna be uh perfect right there about that size so we got right there we got a lot uh uh and this one this one i have no choice i'm gonna make two little pieces but you'll see when i cut it you're going to really like it the way i'm going to do it frank all right so we got some garlic that's going to give us some flavor a little flavor in the marinading the purpose of it is to introduce a little bit of flavor marinating any meat it really goes maybe one or two millimeter into the meat which is a beautiful thing for square steak because it's so thin so if you're going to marinate something this is a piece of meat you want to marinate a little bit of time and just crunch like this a little bit of rosemary we love it we love a little bit of the oil right there the essence of the rosemary and then what else do we need in the marinade now good marinade needs a little bit of acid the acid is going to help us breast break the connecting tissue make the meat a little more tender so i'm using a beautiful sherry vinegar use a good vinegar whatever vinegar you have then you want to eat we definitely want to use a good oil i'm using a tuscan olive oil or a garlic olive oil the olive oil is going to help us make it sticky really important and salt we need salt in there like when we do the brine that help us introduce moisture really important so a little salt in here that helps us make those flavor goes in soy sauce i like to put a little bit of worcestershire sauce yes again some salty products nice flavor umami flavors also wonderful to have okay and we're gonna put some fresh black pepper and we're gonna put a little bit more salt just a little bit more salt and then we're going to put just a little bit more oil i'm using a tuscan herb olive oil the garlic olive oil is wonderful we're going to mix all this together and then we're going to marinate this and probably the dish i have is just slightly a little too big but it's okay we're gonna marinate this for about remember acid will break down connecting tissues sometimes too much so we have to be careful not to marinate marinated too long okay this will be very happy to be marinated for three four hours no more than that three four hours it's thin um the vinegar will get through it and uh it's gonna be nice and acid it's gonna be beautiful all right we're gonna let that marinade every so often just flip it over it's great to do on a grill uh or great to do on uh um in a pen syrup you and and do it in the oven if you don't have a grill but this is perfect for the grill okay we'll let it go like this for um three four hours and i'll see you on the other side when it's nicely marinated okay friends meat has been marinated the grill pan is hot we don't have a grill in the studio so i put a nice green pan i got this stuff that's a beautiful grill pan and um so we're going to grill them and while the meat is grilling we're going to make a little chimichurri sauce and that's a very simple olive oil and herbs and garlic and it's got like a best pesto without the nuts and without the cheese so we're going to make a chimichu sauce so what we're going to do is see the grill marks right there the pan we're going to use let me make sure my heat is good we're going to put the the mysore muscle fiber in the same direction as a grill band so it's going this way it's going this way okay and same directions as the muscle fibers are going and you'll see why in a minute when we cut it i got an extra piece over there that i had it's gonna make a lot of smoke that camera over here is not gonna like it so what we're gonna do also friends um we're gonna leave that alone for a minute and we're gonna make the chimichurri sauce very simple and chimichurri sauce let me get a spoon right there uh it's just a little bit of chopped garlic i made it in advance because i like to seal it i like to make it to the way it sits a little bit for like a couple of hours if you have the time to do it i just want to make a little bit of it for you for you guys right there a little bit of parsley a little bit of cilantro i know a lot of people don't like cilantro it's because sometimes cilantro is overdone but if it's not overdone it's delicious a little bit of french fresh oregano can't find oregano don't worry about it don't put it in there i like to put oregano in there and i got this beautiful roasted garlic olive oil or you could use a tuscan herb olive oil which is wonderful which is why we're using a marinade use garlic olive oil you stress gonna do whatever olive oil makes you happy it's really really that simple folks you see look you can't get any more simple than this right and then i got this um uh scotch bannet pepper this thing is so hot you got to be careful friends and if you're going to use it you don't have to use it i just kind of like to use it a little bit i use it i remove all the seeds because the seeds is really really hot friends we don't want those seeds right there you know if you're sensitive your skin is sensitive use some rubber gloves in there they're really hot but if you put very little of it you're going to be just fine as long as you use very very little and what i like to do and i have to cut them in very fine julienne see very very fine julienne see look how fine that is fine fine fine fine fine julienne right and then we take that fine julienne and we cut it in very very small dice you see a child could do this but don't let them do it it's too hot and you put this in there let me tell you this is not just going to give you some heat friends it's going to give you an amazing flavor scotch bonnet pepper are wonderful so you go one scotch bonnet pepper goes a long way friends so don't use too much of it okay let me see how we doing with my heat over here yeah we're doing good let me check with my um we're doing good are we're not going to do it yeah we're doing good we need to cook a little bit more this is very thin they're going to cook in no time at all so you see look very simple right all right you got this i've already made this one in advance that's the one i'm going to use that ac i like to just uh marinate it like that leave it in the fridge in the fridge for a day or so three days you can leave it don't worry about it it's gonna last okay i reduced the heat a little too much earlier let's see how we're doing over here friends we are we're doing good except it's not really giving me the beautiful mark that i want so we're not doing so good i've reduced the heat too much not supposed to do this so leave it alone you know what i'm going to do friends i'm going to make some quick little potatoes i got look at quit look at those potatoes one last time you seen potatoes that's small they're pretty cool right they call those baby potatoes you know what we're gonna do we're gonna use the chimichurris then we have right there we're gonna put it in a pan and we're just gonna saute them that's all we're gonna do well i poached them first in advance they are already cooked you see they're already cooked so what i gotta do i gotta got a butter one in there and i'm just gonna saute them really quick so if you can't find a little one like that you can find those nouvelle potato that's usually the color they are red or white cut them in half boil them in water first okay let's see how we're doing now hope we're getting enough color we're not already getting the color that i wanted it's because again i reduced it i was afraid i was that's what i was looking for right here that's what i was looking for right here friends not enough color i didn't get enough heat i was afraid to put too much smoke for the camera but it's okay i'm gonna let them rest for a minute let's do this potato really quick so all i do is saute the potato i mean push the potato in water until they cook they got to be cooked okay they got to be cooked completely because you're not going to cook them in there you're just going to reheat this this oil and herb and garlic and we know we don't want to burn this we'll put it right in there like this the only thing we're going to do at this point friends is put a little bit of pepper a little bit of salt and pepper and let me tell you those are going to be amazing little potatoes that's simple your cooking don't have to be complicated all the time all we want to do is warm them up a little bit warm them up a little bit that's all we're interested in doing all right let's see i hope i get some colors in here friends i'm looking for some maya reaction here and uh we're here right here you know what i'm not gonna cook this much longer my friend because if i do they're gonna be overcooked this is very thin you see just a second or two okay i think we're done we're going to let it rest to meet the rest a little bit and then we're going to cut i'm going to show you i want to show you the trick folks now if you notice the muscle fiber they're running parallel parallel to each other running parallel to each other the idea is to reduce the size of the muscle fiber to make it tender so you never cut with a grain you see a lot of people cut with a grain whenever you see that change channel okay i think we're done friends i'm just going to leave them in there for a second to let them rest and like i said the secret is to let it rest for a second to begin with and then number two here we go that's what i'm looking for right here see i got some nice color here friends finally mama mia finally finally found you we're gonna let it rest for a second and then we're gonna slice him and i'm gonna show you the right way to do it it's very important and this is perfect for the grill but if you don't have a grill like i said take a fry pan and do it now if you happen to be very thick on it you maybe want to be careful not to get them too brown on the outside because it's going to take a while to cook the inside sometimes they thick when you buy also your uh steak you want to make sure you buy it from the outside skirt steak you gotta put from the outside not the inside of the belly okay you gotta stay on there inside or outside if it doesn't say on the board it's probably not from the outside probably from the inside which means it's not going to be a standard you know you can buy choice you can buy prime if you can afford it by prime but if you count then by choice it'll be fine also all right let's see how we're doing with the potato okay we're good the potatoes are good i don't want to burn them see they're nice and hot what's going to make them even better is a little black pepper in there all right see how simple that was now we're going to cut them friends this is where we know how it goes okay so let's take now you're going to understand why i cut them in little pieces like that okay what we're going to do now we're going to take them and we're going to cut them a little bit of an angle i don't want to give it too much of an angle if i give it too much of an angle as much as they're going to be the same thickness the muscle fiber is going to be too big so we take it and we flip it like this friends see look look remember when you do with a knife you do long stroke and you flip and look up beautiful that is friends look how beautiful that is let me tell you my friends this got thin thin thin thin okay not too much of an angle i wanted to show you i wanted to show you just look at this you see this my friends melt in your mask and melt in your mouth this is amazing all we're going to do is we're going to put our potatoes in there and then oh there you go bon appetito just like this my friends now you can also take that chimichurri sauce that we made and put a little bit on it you can put you know you can do a nice paper i didn't do it i suppose presentation here normally i'm so much better at it than this you know i wasn't paying attention i was more interested in the eating that i was interested in making a nice presentation here what's wrong with me sometimes i wonder about it look at this you gorgeous you put it right in there you eat this you eat it right
