hey guys welcome back to Parrish if you didn't think you'd ever be able to get a whole roasted chicken on your dinner table on a weeknight I'm here to show you the light the crispy skin juicy bird with an intensely flavored white wine based garlic and herb butter sauce oh my god sign yourselves up and let's get started okay so the first thing we're gonna do is Pat the skin dry that's paramount if you want a crispy skin bird you could also leave it in your fridge overnight and just leave it uncovered and the skin will dry out that way but most people don't have time for that or the room and their refrigerators do it so this is another way take your paper towels and Pat it dries as dry as you can we're gonna remove the backbone with some really sharp kitchen shears if you have like a really sharp knife you can do it that way too but just try to stay as close to the backbone as you possibly can and we're gonna go along both sides of that tail our backbone and it's basically called spatchcocking which sounds like a dirty word but it's not so we're gonna spatchcock this chicken and that's gonna allow us to cook it much faster okay so if you want to save the backbone you can for stock it's perfect for that but I'm just gonna toss it we're gonna clean out the inside of the bird with any unnecessary guts that may be flying around and we're gonna take a really sharp knife and go right down the center of the breastbone that allows the chicken to lay flatter a flatter bird is gonna cook a lot more in the oven because as you know breast meat and the dark meat cook at different temperatures so we want to make sure it's all even and I'm creating very gentle pockets under the skin because I'm gonna season I'm gonna carry the seasonings that I add later you know up under the breast meat and the thigh and just let make sure all of it is seasoned very well I'm starting off with some very flaky kosher salt it's my favorite and some super Monts which just gives it a really good classic flavor of roast chicken and a little bit of garlic powder as well as some onion powder and you want to make sure that you only add these additional seasonings to the flesh side of the chicken and up under the meat side because basically anything that's on the skin other than salt will burn in the oven and we're high roasting this chicken at 425 degrees so we don't want those seasonings to burn add a little bit of olive oil and just massage all of that yummy flavor up in the meat okay just get it up in there try to avoid getting too much of it on the skin because as I said it will burn and we don't want that flip it over and continue to massage make sure it's nice and seasoned so now I'm going to drizzle a little all over the surface of the bird a very thin layer just massage it all over the chicken okay so that it's not a she it's got a nice it's glistening you want her to glisten now don't be shy with the coaster salt here I know it looks like a lot but that's because kosher salt has a very large flake and if there it but it has a very gentle saltiness so just get all the crevices and I'm gonna add a little bit of freshly ground black pepper which you know can end up burning in the oven but I really don't care I just like the way that it looks so I'm adding it we're gonna put that on top of a foil lined baking sheet that also has a rack if you don't have the rack don't worry about it it'll still cook fine but just arrange that so that it's nice and flat you're gonna put that in the center of your 425 degree oven until it's done so now we're gonna work on the sauce and this comes together very quickly so melt some butter and a skillet you're gonna add the shallots and cook those for about maybe 2 to 3 minutes just until they're softened then you're gonna add your Provence and crushed red pepper flakes infuse that good fat some crushed black pepper the garlic saute that for about a minute or two I'm adding a little bit more olive oil here and we're just gonna add some white wine if you want to use chicken stock you can do that but I like the flavor of one so why not we want the wine to reduce and it's gonna do that very quickly I've got this over about medium-high heat and I just want to reduce it until it starts to like move like a sauce you know like I'm gonna swish it around you can see that there's some thickness and body to it I'm adding just a little bit of heavy cream to give it just a little bit more richness totally optional but I like it so I'm adding that and now we're gonna lower the heat and add the fresh lemon juice all of our herbs the lemon zest oh my gosh so good you guys just whisk that together so that the herbs can infuse and we added some cold butter to emulsify the sauce and make it a little more richer and thicker and I'm gonna add just a little bit more heavy cream again personal preference it tastes bombs so I'm just gonna take that off the heat this sauce came together in about five minutes so it's very quick [Music] you guys look at this chicken okay she's gorgeous golden-brown delicious crispy perfect I cannot wait for you to try this recipe it's super fast super quick just
