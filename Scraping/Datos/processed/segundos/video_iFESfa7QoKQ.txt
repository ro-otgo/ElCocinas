hey everybody its Paula welcome to another webisode of the collodi's mood food we're going to show you today because we're going to be ringing in the New Year and this is how we do it okay it's gonna be sauerkraut with a pork tenderloin and we got this recipe from our families when we were growing up we lived in a predominantly at I am German neighborhood and we've got this up for German friends our families did and they handed it down to us so this is a New Year's Eve New Year's Day tradition and you have to start this like three days in advance which may seem like a long time but it's very well worth the wait there's a lot of people out there don't like kraut so don't shut the video off or anything stay with us and watch it because we used to work for restaurants and caterers that would open cans of crowd and barely warm it and it just it's gone awful I'm sorry it's the powerful gonna get crowd gonna do it right we're going to show you how and we're gonna walk you all through the process and it's going to be a three day process for us to show you all right stay tuned we'll be right back in one second okay the Louise Muthu okay we're back to let you know the ingredients that go into this okay again we're doing the sauerkraut and we've got a pork tenderloin here it's preferable for us we really like it it's a 2 pounder now you can get this started out as a four pound okay which is a beautiful thing you can get a really good deal on them at the meat market but what you do is if you get the loin like this and it is beautiful that's all I mean get yourself a four pounder bring it home cut nice thick chops off onto it put them in baggies label and date it put them in the freezer there's a whole other meal for later okay so we got two pounds a bit left right here again do you not buy the bag I'm sorry the canned kraut I'm hanging I'm hanging on the bag won't tell you but get bags or get jars and the refrigerated section very very important don't get the cans because it's got taste like the can and in its not good so we got two two pound bags of Krauts okay the other thing is we have two cups of a lemon-lime soda Sub Pop so we are going to start out with three bottles of beer okay yeah it's going in we're going to be adding more along the way so here's our pork roast now I've got my heat up right now and I've got make sure you get a lid because it's going to spatter at you all right I can see it's getting a hot it's gonna sizzle away you want to brown this on all sides very very key thing so get yourself for two palms you have to I'm solid let some of the water evaporate there that bit might come off fit so that doesn't go back into the pan and then really do a lot of flattering at you but we're going to keep rotating them we're going to brown all four sides hey hey everybody we're back gorgeous gorgeous look at the brownie on all sides and that is a must Brown at first alright now we're going to put it into our roaster now this roaster has been in the family for so long that we don't really know how old it is it's older than the both of us okay and we're not older than dirt yet put the drippings in it have your oven preheated to 300 degrees get all that good stuff in there okay that's all oh yeah can't lose any of it hey what I'm gonna do though is just to make sure we don't lose it all I'm gonna add a little beer oh yeah and and about your beer you want anything but a logger or a creamy basically what you want is a light colored beer okay not not a light beer a light in color you don't want any lagers you want it cream ales you don't want any of that other stuff okay so this just helps you get the rest of that good stuff out that the pork loin has been browning in all right although if that people now what we're gonna do is I want to let you know that we're going to put in okay we're gonna throw now these are two pound packages of kraut again no cans yeah new new new new bags or jars refrigerated section okay so you got four pounds of crop going in with your two pound pork one pork roast pork loin you can get either that's fine we're gonna put these both in here and the reason why we say no cans is because it was what we were told when we were younger and we actually listened and the reason why we did is because if you get the cans they taste like the camp okay you know what your meal tastes like at hand so if you get in the refrigerated section you get the bags one of the jars either are either eat it we're gonna bury Brooklyn here all right there in know what we're gonna do is we're gonna add our two cups of lemon-lime very crucial here now okay pay attention class this is all you need you don't need any apples you don't need any apple cider any apple vinegar any apple anything I know people want to put apples in it if it's no huh that ruins it okay pour that down over and that's 2 cups and that's all you're gonna use through this whole thing of your lemon-lime soda pop now we go for the beer we're gonna start out with three beers okay we're gonna pour them over and then and then the thing is it just just get you and drives you crazy but you still love it it takes three days to make this three days and the browner this gets the better it is so don't freak out when your kraut starts getting really Brown that's when it's really really good and we're gonna show you the steps along the way but it brings in all that flavor we've known people again I won't mention any names but we've known people that don't know how to make kraut they think they do we taught him the right way actually we just took him in what we made and these were people that were non-believers and didn't like crowd because they were opening a giant industrial can they were heating it up from one of the places that I used to work at and it was just gone awful so we had to make it right and show them what was going on not shown but let them taste what it really really truly tastes like and how delicious it is not another thing very very important do you not add any salt along the way notice we didn't add it to a pork tenderloin do not have it in here add lots of black pepper pepper away it's gonna be salty enough okay there was one beer there's two beers going in and again don't think your kids can't eat this because the beers gonna cook out of it and you're just gonna get that rich beautiful flavor okay and the third beer is not happening don't think it's too much because I'll tell you what I know just like any clean yells right there we're gonna end up as we go on and it's going to be time lapse for you and it'd be like jumping ahead in the future in a time machine okay it's going to take us three days to do this but you're gonna see it all in one episode and they ain't gonna be three days for you to sit and watch this so what you want to do at this point time as you got this gorgeousness right here if I can tilt this just a little bit but they can see out there all our friends look it up okay that's gonna be three days of cooking folks but each day it's gonna get better and better and better and brighter brighter brighter so I'm gonna add some pepper right now I mean add some pepper alright let's shake the thing ain't doing it for me right there there we go that's what I'm talking about now you can see the pepper that I've added no salt whatsoever there's enough salt in that kraut already to carry it so if you salt it you're gonna be killing it all right I'm gonna stir this up now if you don't have a ancient roaster or a roaster at all if you do great but what you want to do is make sure you have something deep enough to carry this because we're going to be adding more beers along the way and when we get to our in the future fast forward type thing yeah okay see okay we're gonna be adding dogs to this okay my thumb's not real dogs the hotdogs hotdogs my brother that make sure you got the pepper in there pepper it just it just makes it okay only the end at least two more beers along the cooking way so I'm gonna put a lid on this so if you don't have a roaster with a lid or you don't have a roaster at all at least make sure your pan is deep enough to carrying all this and get a sheet of foil put it over it put it on the top rack of your oven 300 for five hours the first day and while you're at it enjoy yourself a beautiful clan of beer okay Julius mumble just something here and I'll tell you what of I've been loving my cran of beers since he came up with it so we're gonna get this in the oven let me grab a lid so you can see we got this here thing that I think this was like on the Titanic or something and but it still works yeah it's that new stuff that falls apart on you it's dirty stuff that holds up so we're gonna get this in the oven and we'll see you back on the next step put it five hours in the oven for the first night and then we're going to fast-forward you through time and we'll show you what it looks like after that okay stay with us you're watching another episode of go Louise mood food and it is on sauerkraut with a pork tenderloin in here so we're going to be adding extra goodies you're gonna love it you

the oven again with the crowd the beer the lemon lime the Tenderloin that's been seared on all four sides we already showed you that walked it through it second day didn't see that we added another beer okay you might have to add a little bit more beer but you're gonna have to add at least one more my knee too sometimes we need to that's why we said to and if it's a little a little bit of a bite to it then you add just a little bit more a little bit little bit more and keep tasting and as you do it but a little bit more the lemon-lime soda this is day three this is when the lids off this is like the last hour so first day is like five hours of cooking at 300 second day in three hours at 300 and the third day as three hours at 300 the last hour of it you take the lid off because you want this to get really nice and brown on the kraut and your your tenderloin starts looking like this I mean it is just absolutely beautiful that's just a piece of it it's falling apart my mouth is watering as we speak and if you put your dogs in you submerge them the very last hour of cooking time down into the crowd and the juices if you want to pick a boss there that's fine you add that like an and half to two hours before okay you're finished but we only do dogs and we do the pork one in ours and you have to have your kraut and really really brown that's why you take the lid off of it
