through remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that Bell stay tuned friends we're making it right now together [Applause] okay friends the moment I've been waiting for this is a beautiful primary right there frames this is actually a rib roast prime rib would be if this was Prime this is not prime I couldn't find the prime I found Choice it's beautiful choice though when you get it my friends this is a three bone you see one two three bone that's gonna be for about six people a six person or six people six of them yeah uh if I ever come over you better get a bigger one only kidding um uh so we're gonna do that and last year I made it just like that friends with a fat in it and everything I just did it like this and I took the bone after I cooked it this year a lot of people have asked can you please do one boneless and and without the fat on it and everything so I'm gonna do a beautiful rib roast without no ribs very simple to do friends we're going to take the bones out really simple I'm going to show you how to do it um and then we're gonna clean it up and then we're gonna make that beautiful uh um a crust that I'm gonna do on it okay so as you can see there's a bone right there oh oh one more thing I gotta tell you when you buy it friends you want to make sure you buy it from the Chuck hand because you can get that beautiful Spinelli muscle right here you see this this look at that look at that look at this look butter this is if you notice this has been out of my soul right there and if you notice on the other side friends it's very small you see as as it gets uh toward the other side of it uh we don't we don't get hardly any of that and we know we love this so much and that we want to make sure we get it so it's from the Chuck end you'd ask for the Chuck end okay all right so now we're going to remove the bone friends it's very simple to remove the bone okay no no you butcher can do it for you okay you need a a boning knife it helps with a boning knife we're gonna cut in a little bit and then we're going to separate it the secret my friends is to make sure then we keep a knife on the bone and your finger out of the way out of the way and we're gonna see at the beginning it's a little difficult you grabbing oh my goodness make sure your knife is on the bone friends the whole time you're cutting on the bone you see like my knife is on the bone and I'm scraping the bone and you can see I'm going to show you in a minute okay I'm I'm gonna got a position first and then I'll take the camera and I'll put it right in there you see look my knife friends is on the bone so you may also need a bigger knife if you want a scraping and you scrape the bone you see look and you're pushing it down it'll help you keep the knife on a bone see let's get down let's take it down all the way down to the end all the way down to the end and when they get to the end you can flip it on the other side and you can release it that way also makes it very simple you see voila now this is this is a a Ribs Right Here friends this is a ridge right there we can save them we're going to use it okay we're going to clean a little bit more you know I don't I don't really like all that fat right there but some people love it so you can do whatever you want it's really up to you it always is up to you friends it's your ribs it's your roasts this is very expensive Mama me I'll take a second mortgage on house this is so expensive but we don't do it all the time right we do it once in a while only so now in the front right there you got a huge fat cap right there and you can help yourself with your fingers Friends by the way the knife I'm using is the boning knife how much you're removing this part is really up to you okay how much you remove it's really up to you we're not going to throw all this stuff away friends we're going to save it but if we want to make a beautiful roast we gotta get rid of it see and we're going to cut it straight like I said I'm not throwing this away friends this will make a beautiful stock this will be one wonderful we are trying to create a uh a a a a a fat free kind of fat-free like I said for those of you that like The Fat Friends don't be afraid to use the other video than we did it's beautiful we're going to cook with the same principle we're going to do the reverse Sears that's really the perfect way to do it how much fat you remove it's up to you my friends I like to be nice and clean because I'm going to give it a different crust it's um it's very elegant and it's easy for you all you got to do friends is current that's all you got to do you see look spend a little more time if you really want it to be cleaned it's very simple you see a child could do this cut it there you go let's not remove too much now the least possible amount but if I don't remove it friends you know what's going to happen my quest that I'm going to put on it is going to be removed anyway because it's going to melt and my crush is going to remove you see so I want to I want to get rid of this to see all right friends I'm going to take a few more minutes to clean it I don't want to make the video longer than it has to be clean a little bit more in the back we're not going to put a crust in the back so I'm not too concerned about cleaning the back but a little bit is okay and then we're going to come back here we're going to finish to put the crust on it all right we can leave the fire right there this is going to be a top and this is going to be gorgeous all right I'm going to finish it up clean it up a little bit more and then we'll put the crust and we'll put in the oven but before we do that now we're going to take it and we're going to put the salt on it I'm gonna put the salt on it friends on all the way around it you got to leave it in there for a few hours my friend okay four or five hours if you have time Do It um do it overnight my friends do it overnight if you have the time okay we're gonna remember just a little bit more and voila we put it on a rack don't be afraid it looks like a lot of salt don't worry about it it's not all this is gonna penetrate it's gonna make the crust nice beautiful dry we're gonna put it on the rack right here friends and this rock right there it's right right there it's going to allows the air to circulate it's going to allow the salt to penetrate in an hour and a half from now just turn on the other side like this and then we're going to finish it up with a crust that's all there is still it's pretty simple right be back in a few minutes all right friends while the roast beef is resting with the salt on it we are now going to make the break on them we're going to put in I'm going to put the pecorino Romano just a little bit of pecorino Romano a little bit of Parmesan oregano may we buy him good cheese now everybody good cheese you make good stuff um and then I got a little trick here friends I like to put a little bit of cornstarch on the cheese it avoided from sticking to get to it to itself otherwise it gets all Gummy okay so we're gonna brush this a little bit I always do the cheese first it's easier right and then we're gonna put a little more let's do a little more see the cheese got a good Head Start very important right and then we're going to put a little bit of sun-dried tomatoes those are a wet sun-dried tomato I mean they're not in oil but they're moist when I want to buy them want to put a little bit of parsley chapassi you know I like to use the curly parsley sometimes sometimes I use the Italian pasta it depends we're going to put a little bit of salt not too much because the cheese is going to be salty already right I'm gonna put a little bit of garlic little chopped garlic put as much or as little as you want well that's really a matter of opinion here then we're going to put a little bit of a whole squadish a little bit of hot it's going to make a nice and wet it's going to give us the horseradish that is going to go great with the horseradish sauce this is a preparedish I love it it's very simple to use we're getting fresh horseradish these days not easy friends not easy at all it used to be the every grocery store no I can't find it so you got to use the prepare one I know some of you out there growing you're lucky good for your nostrils okay here we go we're gonna put a little boy come in here now because this is wet I just take a country bread sometime I remove the crust when I make it with fish but with this I don't need to and we're gonna mix all this up friends and you see I got the uh the cheese and all that stuff prepared in advance because otherwise it doesn't it doesn't work that way so this is the best way to do it hello and turn it on and we're gonna have a nice moist breadcrumb friends and we're gonna put on top for the roast you see you've been using them fish this is delicious I use them on salmon someone similar not exactly the same but you see look look it's nice and weight wet wet fancy we want to keep it that way a little bit more and we're done we're gonna put in a bowl and we're done friends we are now going to put this in a bowl and when we're ready to cook it we're going to put the Dijon mustard first and then we're gonna put this on top of the rolls all right so we're gonna wait a little more for the roast to be ready okay friends it's best if you wait at least three four hours my friends if you have the time it's even better if you do it the night before all right so remember this is uh see it changes color after the salt as I had an opportunity to uh get away some of the moisture in there it's really nice so now friends we're gonna put some black peppercorn on it because you haven't put any Peppers so far and then we're gonna season it with a mustard and we're gonna put a crust on top and uh and then we're gonna bake it and we're going to do a reverse here which means actually we're going to uh We're Not Gonna sear it we're going to cook at a very low temperature until it gets to what we want we're not going to sear this drink it's gonna have a nice beautiful crust and uh so here we go we're looking good so now I got the breadcrumb that we did earlier I got some Dijon mustard I'm gonna put Dijon mustard in there friends and we're going to rub a a gentle layer you know we don't have to be too thick in it because you put two you put too much it's going to be too much some philosopher than I am today you put too much you can have too much yeah that would be it what I meant to say and I don't explain it good if you put too much it's gonna run and then it's gonna take whatever it it has with it you see what I mean I never you know what I gotta move over there it never that's what I meant to say I meant to say then it doesn't stay on because it's too much I tell you my friends it's a good thing you're patient with me because I love doing this it's sexy see I like it okay enough now we're gonna put the break on let me put this over here I'm gonna wash my hand and because and then I'm going to take a spoon to put it on so that I don't uh or I got the spoon over there you see I'm glad I didn't go directly into the jar or mustard this is the background I want to show you friends the breadcrumb it sticks to itself you see look it's because of all the wet stuff we put in there smells amazing we're gonna put it on there this is a very simple roast to do friends it's very simple it's kind of like the same crust I use it for a rack of lamb and then we really gotta packet in Friends we gotta pack it in pack it in pack it in you know what I forgot guys is a a canola oil I want to put a little canola oil you spray on it I got one over there if you'll be so guys to get me one I always forget something you know canola oil is spray will be kind of nice in there just a little bit we don't need a lot we don't need a lot you see just a little bit or any kind of the olive oil spray or something we want to get a little bit of oil in there a little spray would be kind of great to have in there friends you see I forgot to put it in oh here it is beautiful that's perfect just wait so look friends yes yes yes yes right over there thank you very much see so now look guys pack it in pack it in pack it in pack it in pack it in you see the way I'm doing it you really got to be like packing it in seeing now we don't need to sold it because it's already in there really friends be very very packed in be very packaging yep we're getting there friends look at this it's already beautiful so a little bit of canola oil spray very little very little very little I'm talking about like see just a little bit that's going to hold it together nice voila boom that's it now I gotta I'm gonna put it on the Rock friends because uh I I saved the bones and then we can give that to somebody else then wants to eat it and we'll put it right in there you see now make sure it's nice back then then friends you're gonna lose a little bit of calm don't worry it's not a problem okay we're gonna get rid of the one on the side we don't need it right there and pack it in okay okay one more thing friends let me wash my hands one more time I gotta show you the important thing friends which is where to put your thermometer remember we're going to cook it at a very low temperature we're going to cook it at um uh 240 to 150 degrees until we get to an internal temperature of a 120 degrees and then we're going to take it out we're gonna let it rest as long as 45 minutes not a problem and then when we're ready to eat we're going to go back in the oven at 5 5 50 and give it a beautiful crust on the outside that's a beautiful way that's an easy way to cook the prime rib you see right so now we're going to put it in the middle gonna put it in the middle let me see let me make sure I don't know if you guys can see but I gotta go in the middle I'm trying to get you guys so you can see it I go right in the middle and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna stop right there so I'm gonna be about right here so basically I'm gonna put it in about that much you see so I go in right in the middle right there and I put it in about that much that's it that's all I got to do I can leave it like that in a pan it'll be perfectly fine and this guy right there I'm gonna put it in the oven and I'm gonna plug it in my oven is 250. so let me just go and put it in the oven okay hold on hold on don't go anywhere the oven was a little harder than I want I want it at 250 250. what have I got oh it's a little higher so 250 is what I want and now I'm going to put my thermometer in there and I'm gonna tell it let me know thermometer when it's 118 degrees so at 118 degrees it's going to give me a warning BBB I'm going to take it out and then we'll come back and I'll show you what I'm going to do okay so let's do it so you could take a good two you know I did the one on the bone it took almost three hours this one right there is probably gonna take a good two two and a quarter hours we're gonna find out I'll tell you exactly how long it took okay okay friends it's almost three hours so I'm gonna take it out I got about uh oh 118 degrees friends so I'm gonna take it out let me unplug this thing and uh and we're gonna put it back here friends and we're gonna yeah Mommy so we're gonna let her rest friends you see and that and the beauty is oh I didn't tell you but I put an aluminum pepper in there because sometimes um even if it's a low temperature friends it's uh the aluminum paper gets out of the aluminum paper the the rust gets just a little too Brown because remember now we're going to let it rest because you know you always have to let a piece of meat rest before you cut it otherwise you lose all the juices right who we want to make sure the Jews have an opportunity to redistribute that so we want to let a rest and the cool part about this recipe friends is you're gonna be able to let her rest and and then when you're ready to eat you can let it rest at half hour 45 minutes you're gonna see what it's going to get cold it's going to get a lot colder yes indeed but it's okay because this is not completely finished what we're going to do when we're ready to eat we're gonna pop it in a 500 degree oven matter of fact that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my oven right now I'm gonna put it as high as it gets and then I leave it in there 10 15 minutes it's going to get beautiful and then we're ready to eat and at that point we don't need to uh let it rest anymore because it already rested okay this is just to finish it up so I'm gonna let the rest right here about a half hour and then we're gonna pop it in the oven and then a few minutes to get a beautiful kind of BUN and then we're gonna slice it all right we'll be back in a few minutes okay friends been 30 minutes you can leave it up to 45 minutes you know but 30 minutes is enough my oven is 500 degrees now we're going just a few minutes okay friends and voila let's go and it's only going to take a few minutes 10-15 minutes 500 Degrees and we're gonna get a nice Golden Crust and we'll be ready to slice it we don't have to wait anymore okay friends we're gonna take it out of the oven it should be beautiful golden brown whoo there you go it's gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so now at this point friends uh remember it's on the bone uh and we want to take it out of the bone and uh so we probably can take a one of those guys and you know I had two of them before and somehow I lost one but I got it I got another one and uh we're gonna take it out of there let's take out the whole thing and we'll take it out of the uh we'll take it out of the um the bone what's what's on the cutting board so now at this point friends we don't need to let it rest anymore because it already rested so it's ready for us just to go so we're going to take it out I'm a bit of bones are just they're not even uh they're just attached to it and this is a beautiful yeah you can slice it like that and give your guest or you can take them and finish them up quick in a fry pan and give it a little Maya reaction if you wanted to do this but that would be really cool also so now friends all we got to do that's the beautiful thing about not having to worry about the bone not having to worry nothing I'm not having to worry nothing all we got to do announce the friend is cut it and cut herself a beautiful slice and it's really that simple there's no bone there's no nothing in the mouth the smell of the whole Squad racing sun-dried tomato cost in there my friends is amazing so how big a small of a slice you cut it depends how hungry your guests are and what it is you want to give him obviously the outside pieces are going to be a little more cooked than the inside pieces but you see I have a slicer so you know remember I like it rare the medium rare it's up to you how do you like it my friends and this right there is rare the medium rare and it's absolutely gorgeous so remember foreign degrees and it will be cooked more for you it's up to you it all depends how you like it there's no right or wrong here it's really up to you I took it out at 118. you take it out of 125 127 a letter cook to 130 135 and then you'll have more of a medium rare medium it's really up to you that's the way I love it this is going to melt in my mouth this is gorgeous this you can see right there they spinoli mussels whatever it's going to be there this is going to be beautiful my

to prepare a prime rib friends I hope you make it remember thumbs up if you liked the video subscribe to the channel and ring that Bell thanks for watching okay friends I almost forgot to show you something very important you see the reason why we cooked it slowly at the beginning and finished with the hot heat at the end is to avoid the gray line if you notice it's cooked to Perfection from one end to the next same exact one so it's very important to cook it slowly first okay that just want to make sure I didn't forget to show you that [Music]
