[Music] well hello there my dear friends welcome back to the scott reed project how are you doing so today i've got this wonderful piece of pork here this is a piece of loina pork traditionally where the pork chops come from as you can see we've normally cut in between these ribs slice it down there choppedy chop chop chop you have a pork chop but what i want to do today is to french trim this by that i mean we cut a line across there take that off i'll put that trim into sausage meat trim in between the bones and then we're going to roast it off as a joint so this is what i call proper pork pork as it should be just have a look at that in a minute so you've got that lovely fat on there fat is flavor always remember you need that on your meat yes you may not necessarily want to eat it you can cut it off but you will need it for flavor so without further of a do we're going to get our pig on and prepare this beautiful piece of free range british pork i mean who doesn't like roast pork i love the shoulder i love the belly like i said we would normally have this in chops but we're going to cook this so it's tender and it's juicy because a loin has a tendency a bit like a lego pork to dry out so cook the right way keep an eye on it look for that internal temperature and we are gonna have a corker so what am i doing then french trimming i want to take about that much off exposing the tops of the bones so i'm just going to mark it there so roughly you can see there repeated it the other side and as you can see we've made a mark so what we're going to do is just hold in the bone a nice sharp knife is imperative here we're just going to go down and then take it off the ribs beautiful absolutely perfect meat for sausage making and then that leaves us with this now you can judge it you can take it a little bit shorter if you want to i'm not that fussed so all we need to do is go in between each rib nice and gentle as you can see there down up down up again no waste absolutely no waste on a pig there's no excuse for it so there as you can see the knife is doing the work and up now do i want to take that a little bit further do i do i do i no so what we need to do then is concentrate on getting the rest of this meat off these bones i'm going to show you a nice little trick to save all the scraping look at that it's beautiful in it so we get off as much as we can with our knife this is an odd angle for me to work out because of the camera so take some butcher's twine it's tied double just make a little loop put it over the end of the rib make sure it's on nice and tight and pull and as you can see it pulls the meat off now there was quite a lot of meat on this so i should just go over them again but you will get all of that off it will save the blade of your knife so nice and tight and that by the time we've got a cloth on it will be pretty much as smooth as a baby's bottom so all i'm doing here then is scoring the skin what this does this allows the fat to render out and the skin to crackle what you need to do point of a very sharp knife you can do it in a crisscross diamond fashion i'm going old school just the tip of your knife not into the meat just opening up the skin just like that straight down lovely just look at that do that all the way along and then i'll show you the magic trick to get him good pork crackling every time so what's the secret then well we are already halfway there meat scored properly at room temperature and then salt that's it none of this putting boiling water over it or rubbing oil on it just plenty of salt into all of those grooves will drive out the moisture and as it's at room temperature it gives it a good head start so i'm just getting up any bits of salt just give it a nice rub in you could always put a bit of thyme in there bit of sage i'm just gonna keep it unadulterated so i'm just gonna weigh this then just to work out the cooking times we have got three pounds three ounces so first of all we need to get this into a red hot oven by that i mean an oven that is about 200 220 degrees c i'll put the conversions up there somewhere for an initial 20 minutes that will start the process of turning this lovely piggy stuff into nectar of the gods so a nice baking tray then with a spot of water in the bottom [Music] as you can see not too high up so the heat is going to hit it and then we put that straight into the avon 20 minutes robert is your mother's brother have a look at that and we're only 20 minutes in so just to reiterate then we pre-heated our oven at 220 degrees c if you ever got a fan assisted oven that's 240 so we let it sizzle on that high heat for 20 minutes 25 minutes what i've done now is turn my oven down to 180 degrees c what i'm going to do quickly is just put some little poor sign french letters on these bad boys so the bone doesn't look or withered like that chick madge from benidorm so yes cover them up safe roasting you know the drill so 180 degrees then i'm gonna give it about 20 minutes a pound so it's three and a half pounds so at least an hour hour and a quarter we'll probe it and see how we get on but look already starting to crackle my friends can't wait for this okay let's just have a quick look at this we got about 20 minutes cooking time left can you see that hey it's not only visible to the eye it's audible to the ear absolutely wonderful so we're looking for an internal temperature of 72 degrees what we got here bearing in mind we've got about 20 minutes left it's reading 48 so yeah it's looking good looking good i've got some lovely little potatoes going as well just with some sage thyme some garlic some lovely gravy some apple sauce but that's a bit later on just have a word of that okay my fine little porky friends have a look at that where's me tapping device so that's fully cooked so we did that 20 minutes at that high heat then turned it down 220 degrees we gave it about an hour i think it was an hour and 10 minutes all in we are looking for an internal temperature between 70 and 72. bearing in mind this has to rest yet and the residual heat will take it up another couple of degrees so we'll probe it in a minute to see if scotty still got the minerals but just listen to that let me take my mic off it's beautiful get the probe in i say it wants to be about 68 69 70. can you see that 71 yeah still got it baby so i'll let that rest for 20 minutes my potatoes are rocking so we get that in there that's seriously hot this is all gold it's pure pig liquid it is amazing you could use that to make your roast potatoes or whatever i'm going to stick it in there just look how rich and intense that is you could put that into a fat strainer take off the fat eat it on toast do your potatoes in it whatever it is amazing take the fat off put that juices in the gravy but yes doesn't look much now but wait until that's cool okay on to this bad boy next lightly tented for 20 to 30 minutes and what that will do is obviously when you put anything into heat it scrunches up gets all tense what this will do it will relax and all its natural juices will distribute evenly back through oh my god i just want to get into it so lightly tend to dance and we just wait for time to do it's dependable magic there she is just look at all those lovely rich resting juices take those off they've done their job i cannot wait to carve into this look at it it is a thing of beauty by anybody's standards small knife jesus christ look at that might have to do a bit of choppity chop chop oh look at it oh look at it it's yielding mom it's yielding wow that is just amazing we just need a few little accompaniments so we got our monumental pork chop there's a little basket there of palms per salad i think that's the word potatoes with parsley some beautiful applesauce and a shot of gravy oh okay it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it then we're just amazing so i put parsley thyme sage garlic granules actually but this this is something else hear that hey it's just amazing that crackling free-range pork if you can get it take some serious beating now we ain't going fancy here just a bit of that with me hands it's beyond good absolutely amazing definitely the way forward a bit of that what's going on in the gravy i have no words just amazing just nap that with a little bit of the rest and juices there's the gold that lovely creamy fat almost too good to have anything with it but we put a bit of that on get one of them on like that and if you open wide you can have a bit okay so i know you get loads of guys on the telly on youtube going that was amazing but i'm telling you that genuinely puts something out unbelievable and if you're not spoiled enough you get the bone the rib what would be rietz well that was seriously good and i mean seriously good i mean here at the srp there's no frills there's no pump and circumstance i don't even know if that's the right term but it sounds good it's just good honest cooking and it doesn't get any better than roast pork potato applesauce and gravy so if you have liked what you've seen here on the srp today please click subscribe when my face comes up
