[Music] what's good everybody hey welcome back to my channel smoking and grilling and today we cooking with me av now you guys read the title you seen the thumbnail so you know what i'm making i'm making a delicious meatloaf hey listen the meatloaf is gonna be traditional but i'm gonna just show you where i made just like a little couple of little tweaks to it hey that right here is what's gonna send it over there is and you know what my meat sauce so first thing we're gonna do is we're getting ready to go ahead and preheat this oven we're going to go ahead and preheat it to you know 375 degrees [Music] and now we're getting ready to break right into this video now we're going to go over the ingredients this is all it is listen this is just for the loaf itself after we done that get this done and get it put into the oven then we're going to go ahead and go ahead and make that uh that sauce but i'm going to start off by just here we go let's start off with this we got green bell pepper look this is just a medium-sized green pepper you know i diced it and listen i'm going to show you like this look i want to get them you want to get them kind of fine reason being because i'm not going to saute them so listen the smaller they are the quicker they become soft you know so now we got bread crumbs which right here look this is progressos these are the garlic herb i like these let me give you guys a little tip you guys can buy you know like some flavored uh you can buy flavored crackers you know just beat them up get them down to breadcrumb size and you can use those too now we already talked about this we talked about which is the best ketchup this is my entry right here gotta have these hinds there you go got ketchup minced garlic now here's where we get a little tricky and this is where i started becoming a little fancy with it we got salt and listen we got that creole kick now listen for you guys that don't have creole kick which i suggest you guys get it because i cook with it a lot and to be honest with you i put it on almost everything but you guys can use like an italian seasonings of your own whatever you have in your uh you know your cover now you're gonna see right here i got two seasons in here look that's black pepper and this right here is paprika the difference is listen i hear people say that they can't really taste paprika you know what i mean because i really don't have no taste or whatever they use it for color look this is smoked paprika i'll put a link hey you got to get it we got to start cooking and broadening our horizon folks all right now this is dried parsley i suggest you guys go ahead and get yourself some fresh parsley but listen i'm too stubborn to put you know write everything down or for me put it into my phone didn't pick up no parsley so i'm gonna have to use dried then we got two eggs right here these are two large eggs right here we got a third cup of whole milk and i got them onions too and again listen i cut them down so they fine right so that these will cook and they'll soften up a little bit you know when they're inside the pan all right so you saw that there again this is everything for the meatloaf and then i'm gonna be using this meatloaf pan right here not gonna use that this is it this is a five by nine and you know what let me go ahead and go i don't have it out right now let me get it i got two pounds of uh two pounds of 85 15 ground beef and here it is right here you can see right there 85 15. this is it right here so let's go ahead hurry up and throw this together and get it in the oven okay get yourself a bowl and then you want to just go ahead only thing i tell you is i always start with my ground beef first after that in no particular order we're just going to throw everything in the bowl all right one of the things i like about you know about a meatloaf is it's almost like a crock-pot recipe you know what because what we're going to do is you guys might be familiar with this term called dump and go so we're going to put our onions in you guys getting the point right now huh dump and go bell peppers okay and then we're gonna come with our parsley and again listen if you guys can get fresh parsley that's the best way you know what i mean then you just come with the rest of your seasonings and then right here you can see i'm adding my minced garlic you know what get yourself a rubber spatula you'll be easy on your glass you know and everything will just last longer without your scratches and then after that we're going to come with the ketchup and then our two eggs you know if we making meatloaf we gonna have eggs hey so real simple put that in there and check this out because i didn't use separate bowls i was just cautious about how you know distributed the uh the creole the creole kick and the salt so i kind of like just spread that all the way you know throughout then i was thinking to myself you know just smelling the aroma i was saying to myself hey you know what why not put some w sauce in this also so after adding uh bread crumbs you know i'm thinking i got to put these hands on this meat so let's go ahead and get it in and we're just going to work it like it's dough now you know i just spoke up on it hey this is optional but i'm gonna use it just use yourself about a tablespoon full now listen we're just gonna put about a tablespoon on there it's really up to you you don't want to like overpower it with the w sauce you know what i mean so just a tablespoon and move on and then once we got that mixed up last but not least we just add the milk this right here is going to be moist you guys hey this is gonna make for a killer i mean when i say killer i mean a killer meatloaf you can see how that how it just absorbs up in here it loosens up some of that w sauce and the rest of the ingredients just to ensure that it gets you know completely you know mixed up and then throughout listen you want your flavor to be in every bite now for me i'm gonna go ahead and use some of this non-stick you know you guys can do non-stick you can take a butter and grease it however you want to do it you don't need a whole lot you just want to make sure you get it everywhere but you don't want to pull it all up now our objective is to get this inside this so we can form our mold and then what you want to do is you just want to get it once you get it in here you don't want to pack it i mean listen you want to pack it but you don't want to pack it like where it's super tight you know what we just want to go ahead i'll just do it like this so you guys can see you know i mean you want to make sure you don't have any uh no corners or whatever and then i'm gonna put it like a little design but not really a design but i'll show you just one second all right so what i do is once i got it like this and it's in all four corners you know good now i'll take it like this i take my fingers and i just i give it like a little indentation only on the edges just like this i don't know if you guys can see that [Music] you should have something like that now you want to put it in your preheated oven which should be at 375 degrees we're going to put that in for 45 minutes alexa set a meatloaf timer for 45 minutes meatloaf timer 45 minutes starting now all right got the meatloaf in the oven now i'm getting ready to go ahead and make my meatloaf sauce sauce you know what super simple look all you're gonna need yourself is a bowl i say get yourself a whisk whisk works the best i got this little uh this rubber you know brush this one i'm gonna use to brush the sauce on top of it you know and we got a few ingredients so now let me go ahead and get myself a spatula and then we'll move forward all right okay so first thing we're gonna do is when we start our sauces we're gonna start off with you know pouring our ketchup and that's three quarters cup of that hines you know we didn't already had that debate you guys know where i stand you know what it's hinds the only way to go we got one teaspoon and a half a white vinegar we got two tablespoons this is two tablespoons and a half of brown sugar now i like to take my brown sugar and do this because you know sometimes it comes it depends if it's been out it might have some lumps in it and now i got a trio seasoning for you right here listen we got one teaspoon of garlic powder a half a teaspoon of onion powder and then we got a quarter teaspoon of black pepper [Music] and then here i got my salt i'm just gonna go ahead and give it a little pinch that's about all we need right there now we take our whisk and you know whisk it up do our thing now when it comes out of the oven then we're going to coat it then we're going to go back into the oven for about another 15 to 20 minutes so we'll leave it like this and then we'll wait for the meatloaf to be done okay and then once you come out at an hour i mean excuse me once you come out at 45 minutes this is what you should you know have right here now you remember this this is our meat sauce this right here is what sends it over the top so just giving it another whirl okay what you see in here look i started out using that little rubber brush but that wasn't working so look let me just keep it real go ahead and get yourself a spoon and then put your ketchup you know your sauce on top of that and probably if i wasn't filming i just would have poured it on top now this is what it looks like you know once it's done then we're gonna put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes now here we go i checked it at 15 minutes and i decided to let it get another you know three minutes so a total of 18 minutes you know for me to get it to where you know where my uh my top looks just like this now we're going to let it rest for about 10 to 12 minutes and after that we're going to plate it and then we're gonna slice it okay got it brushed all over look i'm taking a bread knife i just like it for i like to use a knife when i do these you know something that's serrated you know so then i take it let's see i'm gonna go ahead and get myself a fork you know just so that it doesn't move and then we're gonna go ahead and cut ourselves one you know just take your time oh it's nice and moist oh yeah this right here will be that million dollar cut this is what you guys want to see right here this should make you guys run out there and go get it that right there look you can see it's still moist look that's it so i'm gonna cut one more slice now if you ask me how many people do i think this will uh serve i'm gonna say six just to be you know just to be safe oh yeah look at that you guys let's go ahead and just cut one more but it'll probably do eight you know i mean it depends on how big the appetites are at the uh table so here you go folks you know what i mean look staying together is nice and firm but i'm really not using no pressure at all look at this oh yeah and that right there is what i'm talking about so tell me what you guys think about this one here you know what just put my own little spin on an old tradition you know what i mean hey listen and the most important thing i got to say is listen if you never even gave this no thought this meal can be made well i'm not gonna say the whole meal but you can make a meatloaf between ten dollars and twelve dollars you can't beat that hey so i want you guys to let me know down in the comment section below hey what would you serve this with because i'm getting ready to put on some uh
