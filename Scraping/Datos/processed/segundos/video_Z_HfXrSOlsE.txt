stay tuned friends we're doing it right now together [Applause] okay friends I'm very excited about this one I'm gonna show you an amazing way to cook a steak phenomenon I'm doing it with New York street but you can do it with uh riba you can do it with whatever steak you want right really simple I want to get them in the oven I got my oven at 450. and so I'm gonna pencil give it a beautiful color and then I'm going to make a sauce the onion on top of the steak and on top of the caramelas Dono I'm gonna put on one of them I'm gonna put a triple cream brie cheese and the other one I'm gonna put a blue cheese you can do it however you wanna and we make a sauce with a beautiful mushroom sauce friends let's get going now in the pan I'm checking my heat because I want to make sure that I'm hot I want to make sure I'm hot I'm gonna put avocado oil because you know avocado oil has a higher smoke point and uh and it's kind of like flavorless you don't taste avocado don't think it's gonna avocado if you don't have a good vegetable oil friends you want to use um a clarified butter don't use regular butter you scarf my body otherwise a regular bottle is going to burn you know really really quick we're gonna make the sauce for this we want butter we're on regular butter I'm gonna make a nice sauce you'll see very simple friends now the steak friends I already got the salt going on over there I already got the salt I did it 24 hours ago if you have the time do that if not you got to put the salt in as much as you can in advance if you remember this is all in our steak video if you haven't seen the stack video how to cook the perfect steak I recommend you check it out friends it's phenomenal we're going to make a little mushroom sauce in here I got a little shout out going on let's check it to make sure I got the right heat on the steak so like I said I put the salt uh 24 hours ago if you don't have 24 hours if you have a few hours wait put it on the rack don't put the salt don't put the um the salt directly on the uh the steak and don't cover it when you put it in the fridge okay it's got salt already what I gotta do is put pepper that's all I got to do and I like to use a nice crotch crushed black pepper okay so you have a nice presence of pepper put as much as little as you want just make sure let it um it's very important to do salt in advance because it allows us to have a nice dry crust it's very important to dry crust once so we're going to take the steak right now my temperature on my oil is about 350 degrees right now so I'm gonna put it in and at this point I don't care what anybody tells you friends don't touch it leave it alone leave it alone we're gonna make a we're going to create a Maya reaction Maya reaction and Maya reaction is a beautiful cost and uh and we're going to do it on one side beautiful beautiful crust and then when we have that question we're going to flip it on the other side and we're going to continue the whole thing all right friends while the steak is doing is staying so remember check out that video it's worth it for friends okay this is the mushroom sauce okay I got portobello mushroom and I got regular mushroom then I slice thin I got him in Charlotte anyway we're gonna put a little Mushroom in there and as we know as we know they don't know I'm telling you uh mushroom got water in there you're full of water and you know what I think of water nothing I think nothing of water because I I don't like water in my food because water tastes like nothing it really does I mean really think about it right what if there's like nothing so I want it out of there I rather replace it with wine with stock with broth with anything but no water in my food please I mean sometimes I use it you know for baking and making stock you got to use the mixed stock right um otherwise I don't like to use it no in the food a lot of people said they don't like mushrooms because they don't like the mushroom they don't like the texture remember the texture is the conductor of flavor don't forget that texture is the conductor of flavor I talk about that a lot because I want to make sure you all get it it's really important my friends to for you to understand then the right texture conducts the right flavor so if you have a mushroom then test have you ever had a look have you ever had a um a canned mushroom don't do it when you have a cane mushroom we have nightmare for three weeks the the consistency of it it's like you chew on it an explosion of type of water so you don't want that's why you don't want it because it's about texture but in my mushroom you know how many times in my restaurant people will say you know what I like that sauce but no mushroom please I said you know what I tell you what you'll have my sauce the way I make it with a mushroom and if you don't like the sauce I give you the new sauce okay I'm game I I don't want to say I'm betting 100 here but I would say 9 out of 10 people would say you know I don't like mushroom but I like you mushrooms just because they got the water in there they were testing good all right so look what what can I do to help me uh if you look at them right now they got no color they got no collar right we're gonna take a little bit of salt I'm using a porcini mushroom salt that's because I got it you know mushroom sauce your soul just use a regular salt don't worry about it it'll be perfectly fine okay so let's check it don't touch it though look If It Moves by itself you see without me peeling it that means it's ready the protein and release themselves now we can flip it oh it's getting good it needs a little few more minutes okay so now look look what I did friends I saw I poached some carrots carrots they're beautiful look at this you buy them today they get them carrots right there you put them on a stem you know they're very fresh the stems is beautiful and green and all I'm going to do is very simple right put a little bit of olive oil in there very simple I'm gonna put some chopped parsley in there nothing nothing complicated a little bit of salt and pepper a little bit of salt and pepper earlier on the carrots that's all I need little salt and pepper look and I'm gonna pop them in the oven with the steaks all right let's check this let's see what I got oh look at it look at this look at this one now if that's not a beautiful crust I don't know what that is they're gonna go in the oven five minutes that's it in the oven five minutes friends while they go in the oven five minutes I'm gonna finish the sauce right there I'm gonna put the carrots in the oven so I don't forget them because they're cooked already remember the carrots everything is going to be happy in the oven and now all I'm gonna do Oh Mamma Mia I forgot to put the onion on the steak sometime I forget things let me not do that let me not forget this is let me just stuck my diamond I forgot to put the onion on the steak the onions if you don't have those I totally get it again we made a video on this trust me my friends you make them you put them in advance you keep them in the freezer if you haven't ever made harmonize it's with it you see what I do friends I put them nice on top [Music] just like this beautiful then I'm gonna put some cheese on it I want to show you you can put a beautiful piece of brick look I got triple cream brie cheese friends look at this ah it's sticking I had cut the slice but it's giving me a lot of technical issues I cut it in advance you got to cut it when it's cold and then it just married with the other piece nice thin I'm using a triple cream Brie look at this and then you can also do if you don't want to put debris you can put a beautiful blue cheese put a gonzola cheese with a Rockefeller put whatever you want friends you don't put the you know like the golden soda or you don't like the blue cheese then go with the brie cheese you don't want to cheese don't put the cheese all right now we're going to cut down the thyme obviously because they don't need to go back in there another five minutes I'd say another three minutes will be enough three and a half four minutes okay I'll repair this all right now let me continue over there friends let me get going I gotta get everything back in gear now I think we're good I always forget something oh I wanted to tell you about the onion friends there's so much to tell you sometimes see I make him I put him in a little container like this see look like this and I freeze them they stay in the freezer for 17 years you make a tomato you put them on top of fish you put them on top of anything they're amazing they're really our friends okay potatoes Jack is going crazy now because I got the camera going everywhere I got a little bit of olive oil I got a little bit of olive oil now I'm going to put a little bit of garlic I'm gonna put a little bit of time and a little bit of Rosemary that's going to be the flavor of the day little time little Rosemary I'm gonna get this hot then the potatoes friends I already cooked the potatoes see I use the nouvelle potatoes I cut them in decent pizza slice and I purchased them in boiling water so they're cooked all I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna reheat them in here okay that's all I'm gonna do really simple they cooked now I want you to see the mushroom friends if you could be here right now to smell them you will not believe it smells amazing and you see and look look at the color look at the color you remember it was no color before we got a push this we got to get a little more color they've lost all of their volume look at the potatoes very simple you take them get in there yo they cooked remember putting them all the volume fresh herbs in there a little bit of chopped parsley look at this a child could do this the secret friends the secret is to get everything ready in advance this is a kind of video by the way friends that you can make you know you can you can do with me prepare everything in advance after the whole thing set up go wind back the video the way I'm gonna put some cheese in there the way the the um the my kitchen was set up and you can do it in advance let's finish the sauce friends we're gonna put a touch of balsamic vinegar now remember my Buddhism vinegar is an age balsamic vinegar it's age 18 years old so 18 years so it's it's soft and sweet if you don't have an 18 year old balsamic vinegar don't put a regular balsamic vinegar in there because it'll be too harsh on you I'm gonna put a bit of Masala wine just a little bit of Masala wine it's a dry Masala wine because my vinegar is sweet now if you have a young balsamic vinegar you probably can still make that sauce but then you want to make it with a sweet sweet and sour they got to balance each other all right so we're gonna put a little bit of stock a little bit of stock in there friends I got a beef stock look how beautiful that beef stock is for it's look how gorgeous studies and believe it or not we're done how are we doing on the steak another one minutes I'm doing good I'm doing good the reason why I'm doing good friends first of all because I love my life but but second of all because I was ready my Mison plus is ready when you miss on plus is ready it's easy to cook you got to go through everything what am I going to do first take an intern another thing friends look at this look at look at those potatoes they're gorgeous sometimes I'm coming back here more often the food is delicious on the sauce friends you don't have to do this but I'm telling you try Bree oh blue cheese today I'm putting blue cheese all right Gorgonzola cheese or Rutherford whatever one you want as long as it's good quality don't be buying that cheap stuff at the grocery store for some of them are really cheap no good Mama me that means the timer that means I gotta go good move oh that was a good see that was a very good move friends we're gonna check it oh yeah oh yeah friends we're gonna put a little bit of parsley in here oh look at this so we got one with a blue cheese and and one with a Brie the potatoes all I gotta do now friends is check on the um and the carrots and we're ready to eat so now look the sauce is good friends but you notice it's a little liquid it's a little liquid right so now I could put a little cornstarch diluted in water or if I had made a rule in advance like we did on the video right there and then you have it you can always take a little bit of cuckoo and you can put it in here it's already cooked you put it in there you make it you keep it in your kitchen it's a room temperature you can use it as you need it and voila friends and this sauce right there friends you can rub it all over your body we're going to put a little bit of fresh thyme a little bit of Rosemary at the last minute right put a little salt in there put a bit of pepper I'm gonna have a lot of pepper on the
