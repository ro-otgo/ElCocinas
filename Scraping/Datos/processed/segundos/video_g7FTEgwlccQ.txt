[Music] hello everyone welcome back to mama in the kitchen today I'm gonna be showing you how to make boneless buffalo wings so I'm gonna go ahead and show you the ingredients so I went ahead and already mixed my spices in a bowl so what I'm gonna be using is some cumin salt black pepper chili powder onion powder and garlic powder and I will be listing all the ingredients with the exact measurements down in the description box below so make sure you check that out to get the exact measurements for the spices and then over here in a bowl I have 2 cups of flour mixed in with 2/3 of a cup of corn starch and then I'm also going to be using a brine so in this bowl I have a quarter cup of salt a quarter cup of sugar mixed in with four cups of cold water and then for my egg mixture I have two eggs mixed in with one cup of milk and then for the sauce that I'm gonna be coding my chicken with I'm gonna be using about one teaspoon of cornstarch one stick of unsalted butter 12 ounces of the Frank's hot sauce I use the buffalo wings hot sauce and then some more sushar sauce so again I will have the exact measurements in the description box below so just check that out and then I'm also going to be using some chicken breasts I have 2 pounds of 2-inch thick chicken breasts you can use tenderloins but today I'm going to be using breasts and this is it for the ingredients let's go ahead and get started okay so the first thing I'm going to be doing is we're gonna be adding my chicken pieces to the brine and then I'm gonna cover with some saran wrap and place in the fridge for one hour if you can do it for longer it's better so if you have time I would do it for about 4 hours but today I'm only going to be doing it for one hour so I'm going to cover this and place it in the fridge for an hour okay so I'm about to take out the chicken but before I do that I'm gonna go ahead and make send my spices with the all-purpose flour and the cornstarch and I'm just gonna mix it in very well now I'm gonna be coating the chicken so I'm going to take it straight out of the brine and then I'm gonna place it into the flour and make sure I coat that with that and then I'm gonna place it and the egg mixture and then back into the flour and then I'm gonna repeat that for all my pieces of chicken and then once they're coated for the first time I'm gonna be coating them again and I'll show you when I do that [Music] okay so now I went ahead and put it on my chicken once and now I'm gonna go ahead and coat them again so for the second time I'm just gonna be dipping them in the egg mixture and then back into the flour mixture and then place them back on this baking sheet [Music] hey I went ahead and double coded all my chicken now and I'm gonna go ahead and cover this and place it in the fridge for 15 minutes and I'm gonna go ahead and make my sauce so for the sauce I went ahead and melted my stick of butter this is unsalted butter and I'm adding the 12 ounces of hot sauce is Buffalo hot sauce and I like the Franks brand and then I'm also gonna be adding my worst asure sauce so I'm gonna be adding about a teaspoon of that and one teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it up so I'm gonna go ahead and just mix this on a medium high heat and after adding the cornstarch once it kind of starts to thicken up I'm gonna turn off the heat and just place this in a bowl and set it aside [Music] all right so now I'm gonna go ahead and place this in a large bowl and I'm gonna get started on frying my chicken so I went ahead and heated my canola oil to 350 degrees and I placed my chicken and my frying basket and I'm gonna be doing this in batches you don't want to overcrowd it and I'm gonna fry it for about five minutes all right and this is what it looks like after frying for five minutes then I'm gonna go ahead and just place these on a cooling rack and continue to fry the rest of the chicken all right so I went ahead and fried all my chicken and now what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna put them back into the basket the frying basket and I'm going to fry them for another minute so this will just make them a little bit extra crispy [Music] after frying I went ahead and out of my chicken to the bowl that had the buffalo sauce and I'm just gonna toss them in the buffalo sauce until they're completely coated all right and this is what the chicken is gonna look like once it's completely coated with the buffalo sauce and now it's ready to serve I'm gonna be serving this with some celery sticks but this goes great with some fries or carrots but I'm serving with celery sticks and chunky blue cheese and this is a final look of the boneless buffalo wings thank you for watching and please like share and subscribe
