hello again I'm John tears ACK and welcome to another video cooking lesson of my beer at the seasoned cook today I'm going to answer the question of how to make what I call calamari Shinhwa Shinhwa is the French word for the word Chinese so it means Chinese style komari and we're using you tense eyes bodies of calamari and they come frozen and there are no tentacles involved so what I've done is I have three of these already pound it out and cut up in this milk I'm going to show you exactly how I did that with these with this one here so I'm going to cut it open so we can get it flat on the table then I'm going to use this Jakarta which has about 40 sharp needles in it to tenderize this large piece of squid now I'm going to cut this exactly the way I cut all the pieces that are here inside this milk cut it in half then I'm going to cut each half in half I'm gonna heat cut each half of the half into thirds so we have some fairly substantial sized pieces here now this is about 6 ounces total four of these so we're going to treat this as if it's a main dish or an appetizer for two three or four people so we're going to soak this calamari in the milk to help neutralize any oils that are in the calamari which has a tendency to create the fishiness which is the reason why fish is often dipped in milk or soaked in milk temporarily before it's cooked so we'll let this soak for about thirty minutes and we'll come back and we will make the calamari chinois which is a really neat dish it's got sweet soy sauce the calamari in this with pieces of broccoli red pepper fresh ginger scallions garlic it's and we're gonna serve it on a bed of spinach this is really good stuff so I'll see you in about a half an hour okay it's been 30 minutes the calamari has been soaking let's start this process first we're gonna drain the milk off the calamari let's let that drain for a second let's put a little bit of pepper into our quart of flour here and a very small amount of salt because don't forget there's going to be sweet soy added to this dish along with the broccoli minced red pepper mint celery garlic scallions ginger cilantro spinach sesame oil olive oil this is a good dish okay we got the bulk of that milk out of there but we want to have some of that milk left on there because that helps the calamari absorbed the flour and the flour clinging to the calamari so let's get this mixed up this is really a fun and tasty dish now this one unlike maybe some of the other fried calamari that I make I want this one fried a little bit crispier than normal because I'm going to be tossing it it's a liquid before it ends up on that bed of spinach there so we got it pretty well coated here so now let's put it in a colander to shape off some of this excess flour like so then let's get it right in the frying oil let's get the rest of this in here quickly but there we go we got about 6 ounces of calamari there you want just give it a shape so it doesn't get stuck together this is gonna be about a three to four minute process and while that's frying we're gonna put together the ingredients that it's going to be tossed it looks good you want to give it a shake to make sure it's not getting stuck together so we're gonna start by putting about a cup and a half of or a cup of sweet soy sauce in the bowl you're gonna put a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil we're gonna put about a teaspoon and a half of good sesame oil in there we're gonna put a teaspoon teaspoon and a half of fresh garlic we're gonna put some blanched broccoli florets that I chopped up I got about 3/4 of a cup there then I got about a quarter of a cup of minced celery and minced fresh red pepper and I've got about a tablespoon and a half of fresh minced raw ginger root here and we'll put about a half a cup of scallions in there we're going to save a few to sprinkle on top the heat from the calamari will warm this and this stuff doesn't have to be hot when the calamari hits at the begin with so I purposely didn't heat it up for that reason let's fast-forward here about two minutes while this is frying we'll be right back to mix this all together and get it on the bed of spinach to serve to you about four and a half minutes there we go see how nice and crispy that is and brown you want it crispy like I said because it's going to be tossed into this mixture like so nice nice nice nice now let's get this on to the serving platter oh this looks good this looks great this is my kind of calamari dish see if we can get it all in one spot nice okay now I say a little fresh cilantro chopped on top and could have I mixed cilantro into the mixture I could have but I kind of like it just sprinkled on top too and a few white sesame seeds and a few black sesame seeds nice nice nice a few more green scallions on top just for fun and there you go I think I hope I better have answered the question of how to make my column our Xinhua or Chinese style column art this looks really good we're going to dive into this right now thanks
