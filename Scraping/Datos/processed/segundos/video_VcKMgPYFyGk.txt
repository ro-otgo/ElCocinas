a bone-in pork roast is a super delicious way to have a special holiday main dish this is not a boring pork roast instead it has tons of flavor I show you the simple ways to make it low and slow so it locks in all of the moisture all of the flavor and then roast at the end for that beautiful crackly skin you're going to enjoy it and be surprised how easy this is holidays we think of special occasion meals special occasion meat sometimes and so this is a pork roast but it is a bone-in pork roast also called a rib roast sometimes and traditionally a lot of people do a beef rib roast sometimes a standing rib roast um they can be pretty pricey they're delicious but a pork roast is a great way to have the same type of presentation something a little bit elevated super easy super stress free but looks like it took a little bit extra time so this is a rib roast and what I'm doing is fringing the bones now you can go and get your roast and say you want to bone in some people do this to make a crown roast pork really the only reason to do that is just for the look I don't really think they're worth it I actually just like to do a standing rib roast like this with pork and I am fritching the bones because I forgot to have the butcher do it this is something a lot of times you can just ask your butcher do can you Fringe the bones what does that mean it means cleaning the bones so you expose the bone it's just a traditional thing now let me tell you something it does nothing to affect the flavor it does nothing to really affect it other than it makes it a little bit cleaner because you don't have all the fat and all the extra meat around the bone so when you're roasting it's easier it's also easier to eat because you don't have all that to cut around at the table all that's left is just this little bone here at the top with the whole meat loin underneath so when you look at this you have the pork loin right here is the tender sirloin pretty much then this has all the bone and the rib on it so that's what we're doing now again you don't even have to clean these off if you want this is just for a more elegant presentation to make it a little bit more of a Christmas tradition something to do so to do that I'm taking a boning knife and I'm cutting down right next to the next rib I have and I'm just going to cut off the in between now obviously this is what you save this is rib meat so when you make ribs this is what you're eating so save that eat it roast it whatever you want and then you cut back behind it and you just start see how it's just kind of cutting against it and you're going to say well the bone doesn't look very clean but that is then where it comes in and you can start cleaning it now again don't feel bad asking your butcher to do this but it's also not that hard to do at home if you forget like I did you just take the heel then of your knife use a boning knife and you just scrape against them until they're clean so I'm going to finish up with this one then we'll go on to the flavoring so I got this done wash my hands what you can see though here is really cleaned bones again it's for presentation that's the thing at Christmas I think we have to remember it's a time to kind of do the extra use the Good China do the fun things and the thing is with meat I don't have meat all the time but when I do I make sure to get good quality meat that was treated right weight raised well and then I treat it right too I think that's the important part here so what I have over here is what we're going to put on it which is kind of like a quick little spice rub nothing too intense so I have some Rosemary that I chopped up now Rosemary when it comes to Winter it has a little bit of a heavier Aroma to it so we use it a lot in the winter and I love that I think that's really important have some garlic that is fresh that I have put together and you can see I just minced it and I'm gonna put that right in just a little dish with the pepper just you know ground black pepper because these are the things when you're having Rosemary when you're having garlic you don't want to fight with too many other things they're both nice and strong they have a lot of flavor to them so we're going to kind of leave them as is as the stars of the show now since I'm doing a rub on this I want to do just a very small amount very small amount of brown sugar that little bit of sweetness what it does is this has been sitting out so it dried out a little bit but since we're not wanting sweetness here but what we are wanting is it to caramelize almost on the meat offer a little bit more of this moisture play which sounds weird but what it does is it mixes the salt and really intensifies that retention in there which is wonderful we're going to add some salt kosher salt super important so just like I always say whether it's the turkey whatever it is Saltine the meat is super important so I'm going to mix all this together and you can see it becomes Sandy it just kind of starts to soak in some of the moistures that we're creating from the garlic even the Rosemary has some of that essential oil and it starts coming out so now what I want to do is come over to the prepared it's a beautiful center cut piece here so we use a center cut because then it has somewhat even thickness throughout if you get it to an end it starts getting narrow so make sure to always get that center cut I'm taking my knife and I'm going straight down into the fat cap side and I'm making some just small little slivers right inside of it but this can be a place for me to do is a place for me to see how I can get my finger in there just put some of that salt mixture and that flavoring right in it's really hard to get flavors like Rosemary into meat salt goes into meat sugar goes into meat flavorings like Rosemary don't always so we do things like this with a garlic and the Rosemary can actually get in and get some of that flavor where we want it so now what I'm going to do is take this mixture and just start rubbing it on and when I'm doing it you're going to see I'm going to make sure to get it in those little divots I created and this is just getting it in where we want it getting it right to the meat so that flavor gets dispersed all the way throughout and rub it all over so I flipped it over and I made sure to rub it on this side too I didn't put the divots on this side because the others went in kind of deep and I don't want to kind of counteract all those so I'm getting that salt that mixture all the way around now the only thing I want to do is put some string around it so this is just butchers twine butcher's rope if you will and what this does is it's going to just make sure it's somewhat evenly Rose because the thing is if you notice see how when I lay it down see how it flattens it out and if I stand it up it's more upright and it spreads it out so if you put these strings kind of in between what I'm going to do is lay them out put them in between each rib what that will do is ensure that as it is roasting you'll just have an even roast you can see as I cinch it together it right away just pulls it into that nice round and that's what you want you want that nice round so when you're putting these on it's always best to Loop it through once like you always would but then Loop it through a second time and pull what that does it holds and allows you the chance to then just tie it into a knot and that makes so like a butcher doesn't have to have a second person putting a finger down you know like when we're making gifts and we're wrapping gifts at Christmas and you're like can you complete your finger here so I can make that bow you don't have to do that if you do this double it's one of those little things that makes a big difference so I'm gonna finish this up then I'm going to set this in the fridge for about two hours one to two hours just like I do with any meat I want that salt that sugar to really work into the meat it's going to season it better flavor it better super important so this has been sitting in the fridge it was marinating dry rub sitting that's really what you want and now you can see it looks pretty much the same but what we're going to do is we're going to roast it now we're going to roast it of course on a rack the reason we do this so it just doesn't sit in its own juice and notice I have the fat cap just that little bit of fat sitting up why it kind of self base as that melts in the fruit in the oven it just kind of runs over the meat and that's what you want so air movement all the way around it will help it actually so it roasts evenly now what I'm going to do on this is a reverse roast method or reverse sear almost method meaning sometimes like we do mistakes I'm going to start it lower we're going to do a little bit lower and slower and then at the end we're going to crank the heat up to really get that crackly crispy exterior that you want so it's going to cook very evenly and low because pork has a tendency to what overcook gets to dry gets boring tasteless that's not what this is about this is about goodness so this roasted low and slow for quite a while and it doesn't look that gray right now it looks kind of like blah that's good that means we did not overcook it we cooked it just to 140 degrees then I brought it out of the oven so I could crank the oven up and while it was sitting that residual heat brought it up to 150 now I have the oven set High 500 Degrees and what I want to do is now just sear that fat and all the outside to give it some color it doesn't take much time at all and during that time we're going to make the sauce off camera I just said the sauce was a dump and go do you know what that means it's really no work we dump everything together and it's good to go it just has to cook a little bit so we're going to start with orange marmalade whatever brand or store-bought you can use home whatever you like we're gonna put that right in there we're gonna add some cranberries so cranberries have a tartness they have a sweetness and guess what they have pectin to them too and that's a beautiful thing because it thickens up with the marmalade a little bit don't knock it Dijon mustard I find Dijon mustard I could find a way to work it into almost anything I'm making in the kitchen and it's worth it it has a funkiness but it has this underlying flavor it really adds another spice we're going to add it's a weird one a little bit of clove now clove works really well with the flavors going on here with the marmalade with that mustard and it really does do something special we're going to add a little bit of orange zest so what the orange zest will do is one I think we all know by now oranges cranberries they're a friend and we're adding orange marmalade so already there's a good orange punch this is going to add a little bit more of that freshness right away so I do it upside down on my grater it traps it all and then I can just like that and put it right in I love that then I'm going to cut my orange in half just so I can add oh it's a beautiful one a little bit of that juice right in there and that's just gonna again add a little bit of that flavor right there I'm gonna throw one bigger Rosemary in we can just stir this together here not that you you can do it here you can do it on the stove we're going to bring it up to a simmer just let it simmer for a little bit until all those cranberries burst the meat will be done everything will be ready we'll be good to go so this literally cooked for just a few minutes just until those cranberries were beginning to burst so you can see I like some just to stay a butthole a lot of them are just bursting and see how soft they are so releasing their pectin and they're kind of sweet tartness which is what I want it's a beautiful sauce to have with it and then the meat came out of the oven now the meat had already rested outside the oven while it was preheating to the higher temperature which meat needs to rest before you slice it and everything you can just slice it because it redistributes the juices it helps so they don't dry out more yeah it's a big and it really makes a difference so I'm pulling off just all those strings see how evenly and beautiful it roasted and so now you know the traditional presentation is right here in front of you you can do it like that I like to maybe show it or just have a few you know you can make as big of one or small one as you want I like to have maybe a few of them then cut so you have kind of the presentation of the whole roast but then going through when you look uh look at that beautifulness now pork always has a slight pink to it that's very normal pork should you don't want to over roast your pork it will get dry use the temperature gauge you'll be happy and you'll have such a much better pork because of it so if you slice just a couple you're going to see how they're just beautiful I really I I think this is beautiful so you can even if you don't need if you have a bigger one you know you could have part of it on there have the other two kind of lane open beside it it's a it's a beautiful presentation it's a special presentation that's the point so I will of course try one as one must I do what I have to do now if you're not into bones you're gonna think well this is weird you know it's just that traditional look it's that beautiful presentation that is kind of just iconic and there it is all together it's beautiful the sauce just complements just enough it adds just kind of a look how juicy that is when you just push on you can just tell it's umpxious and juicy so when I just slice into it look at that it's just beautiful look at how it just falls apart it's so tender get a little bit of that sauce on there I'm excited [Music] that's so tender I think pork is underrated now one I grew up in Iowa and I still live there so that could be biased thing more so I think we just don't know how to cook pork properly and a lot of times we end up way over roasting it drying it out not having that real flavor so what we did here was we had a beautiful dry kind of Sandy rub to put on it with that garlic and the salt and the Rosemary and it really flavored it we let it sit on there for just a little bit you can just see how juicy it still is and then we roasted it low and slow to make sure we just brought it up to temperature not over roasting it and finished it by getting a crackly crispy skin at a higher Heat it's beautiful it's a great presentation you often ask what we do for Christmas eve of my family we make something special this is what it's going to
