well hello dear friends welcome again to another fantastic show we got the beef right here folks for those of you then may have seen um how i prepare those roasts if you haven't seen it go to the channel and look for how to prepare a beef tenderloin how to tie a beef tenderloin i don't know what we called it but it's in there because this is really cool okay this is the chateaubriand this is the center cut didn't need the tile but i tied it anyway it doesn't need to be tied this is the center cut of the filament you know okay this is how it goes boom boom like this okay and the tail end right there already ate it okay but it was the tail end but if you watch the um how to prepare the whole tenderloin i take it out of the cryback and i clean it up and i do all this i show you how to do it okay so you got to watch it all right but now all we're going to do friends we're going to cook it very simple okay now a beef tenderloin now if i'm doing a rib roast i'm going to do the reverse here where i start slowly and then i finish it at the end of it across a beef tenderloin i probably cook thousands of in my career and i'll tell you i love it with a beautiful crust very simply put it in the pan and pop it in the oven and rotate it constantly twist it around turn it around it's fabulous uh we uh put the salt already last night so this is 24 hours sold the salt where you put it in and if you haven't watched the steak video watch this tech video we talked about all that i'm not going to go over details about that anymore because for those of you that watch the video i don't want to be redundant i'm already with them than too often so we put the salt on it overnight and and it's pretty dry change color it gets a little darker and this is obviously a much bigger piece than this one this one's going to cook in about 12 minutes uh depends how you like a cook i would say about 12 minutes and this one is probably going to take 18 minutes we're going to found out we're going to go exactly we're going to time it and we're going to ride it on the recipe i got cast iron pan with um uh uh avocado oil in it you could put uh a clarified butter but you don't get as good of a crust so i got a high smoke point avocado oil in there it gives it a really nice crust and that's what we're looking for in here the beautiful crust okay so and we're going to do both of them in separate pan and the reason why i did this one here remember this is the whole head it's the head of the tenderloin see right there this is the head of the tenderloin if i don't tie it it's not going to cook evenly the reason why i did this because i wanted to show you when you do a tenderloin you don't just use the chateaubriand you use the whole thing and and you're going to be amazed i cut it it looks like one perfect piece of meat when really this is about three pieces of meat at the head of the tenderloin if you clean one people said oh cut that up in stew meat that is no good for stew meat absolutely not okay salt we don't need pepper we're gonna add some we're gonna add some in a little while we're gonna put it in the pan the temperature of my oil is about 360 400 degrees 360 365. make sure it's really hot we're going to yeah well i'm not exactly at 360 yet so i'm not going to touch it for a minute until it gets there and this guy right there and then we so remember got the salt already in there so i don't need the salt anymore uh all right now all we're gonna do we're gonna put it in and we're gonna keep rotating it okay if you don't have a cast iron pen don't worry get yourself a nice big stainless steel pipe okay and the idea is to keep moving it around keep moving it around we're going to create a really really nice cut you want to reverse sears you can do it but i'm going to do the rib roast and i'm going to show you all about that for those of you that have been asking oh by the way when you put the salt you do it overnight you do it on a rack so it gets air circulation for you a lot of you have been asking about sous-vide we will do a sous-vide whole collection of recipes i'm testing some machines right now which one i like which one i don't like better so we're gonna test them and then i'll come up with some results i'm gonna say this is the favorite machine this is how we do it and then i teach you all about it okay all right so look we're gonna start there we're going to get a golden brown on our side you put it in a pan but remember for the first two minutes three minutes don't touch it why because you want the protein to release themselves so it doesn't stick it creates a better crust i promise you okay every day you can flip it around you can flip it all you want after you give it a nice crust by all means do flip it but until you give it a good crust don't touch it okay so see right there sticking a little bit and if you're sticking what happens is when you stick it you bruise the the crust you're gonna be making that's why i don't want to flip it too much okay when you have a crust on it don't worry you can flip it all you want my fact i want you to flip it when you have a whole crust in there all right see sticks a little bit we're going to leave it across so i'll tell you what we don't want to make the video too long friends so i'm going to continue doing this off camera so the video is not for three hours because you're going to take time to do this i want you to take the time to do it and then we'll come back when it's nice and golden brown we're going to pop them in the oven okay all right friends you see took about four or five minutes i'm keeping flipping and look look see constantly flipping it all the way around it and now my oven is preheated at 450 degree friends 450 degrees i'm going to put them both in but both in the oven and i'll come back and i'm going to show you how to flip them we're going to flip them okay well we're going to continue flipping here's one and here's number two oh that pen is heavy all right we'll check temperature and we'll be back when they're ready all right i'm gonna flip him now friends oh yes all i gotta do is just flip him completely on the other side i'll do that every two or three minutes and uh and flip them on the other side two or three minutes to flip on the other side so they cook evenly on all sides all right i'll be back in a few minutes all right friends i'm gonna take the little one out i'm gonna take the little one out i'm gonna let it rest for a little while we're gonna let it rest and uh let's look at the time so we'll make sure we'll publish the time exactly how many minutes it's been and uh because it's really important it depends the temperature of your oven friends but we write that on on on the recipe based on the size of it very important we're going to let it rest uh i took it out at about 118 degrees we're gonna let it rest and now we can make a quick little pen sauce while we're waiting for the other one um there's quite a bit of uh a fat in there and uh we can get rid of some of that fat friends let me get a cup in here i'm gonna get rid of some of that fat right there some of that oil right there just a little bit and we're going to make a very simple pen sauce there's a lot of goodies in there so i got some that's what we're waiting for the other one to uh plus we're waiting for this guy to rest right we're going to make a really really quick pen sauce friends and uh i got some shallots chop right there very very simple this is a quick pen sauce right we have some beautiful sauces that we are starting to publish you know we did the sauce collection as we promised we're starting to build it we made a beautiful mushroom sauce that would be delicious with this so we are just making a really really quick pen sauce right here very simple friends for the glaze all this with beautiful shallots sphere of shallots use onion perfectly fine whatever herbs you want to use you know one of my favorite herbs is targo but sage is wonderful rosemary is wonderful thyme is wonderful use whatever herbs you want to use in here you could put a garlic in there too if you wanted to and we're going to reduce just a little bit of red wine in there you don't want red wine don't worry don't put the red wine in there just put your broth in here this is just a really quick pen sauce this is not complicated did i say put a red wine in there yeah put our red wine in there remember whenever you're cooking with wine friends you want to let it reduce reduce reduce reduce this is like a a two-minute spin sauce let the wine reduce and then we're gonna put a little bit of stock in here when the wine is reduced we're gonna let it reduce reduce reduce we're gonna put a bit of a i crushed some black pepper so i didn't have to turn i'm going to put a little bit of black pepper in here and don't be afraid of putting black pepper in here friends we're going to wait we're not going to cut it yet got to wait about 10 minutes you got to wait about 10 minutes at least 10 minutes and the idea explained i'll explain so you understand it all right we're going to let this reduce now friends let me explain you why what happened is the outside where the crust is all the muscle fibers are released off their juices there's no more juices in there because at that temperature when you put them in a pan at 365 400 degrees all the juice escape so now all the juices are in the middle of it then juice in the middle the meat is 120 degrees they can hold all the juices in the world when you let a rest then it gets to 130 135 then the juice can come from the inside and redistribute more so the muscle fiber on the outside can now take a little more juices and that's how you do it if you cut it right away all the juices are in the middle because the juice goes in the middle they don't go in the middle they stay in the middle that's where all the juices eat so if you're cutting you lose all that juice give time for some of that juice to go back on the outside that has lost all of its juice when you were cooking it and when you were uh uh brining it and when you sauteed in a pan you lost a lot of the juices so now let that juice redistribute from the center into the outside so when you cut it's going to be nice and juicy all right so we're going to let that rest we're going to get that reduced and then in a minute we're going to take the other one and the reason why i did both of them i want to show you the difference from the chateaubriand center cut to one then is that the end where everybody say makes two meters this is the head of the tenderloin and and the tail you can use both of them the secret it's the time very carefully and exactly what we did so we're going to show you what it looks like it all right we're going to let that reduce and we're going to come back in a few minutes and take the big one out all right friends we're going to take out the big one now and this one was in there oh a lot longer uh so we're gonna write down the uh the measurement the uh the time exactly and uh and don't be afraid friends everybody's like oh my mommy you poked all the juices out no you don't you know you don't talk you poke just a little bit of the juice out so little you'll never know in a million years don't be afraid this is very very uh big and and and uh you you take a thermometer it's much easier now it's easier if you have a little stick you can kind of guess what it's going to be but a big roast like that i'd rather you take a thermometer my friend okay and don't be afraid right now i'm looking at uh about 120. i'm looking for about 120. oh yes you got to be careful not to go too much i'm 121 right now 120 121. okay i'm going to let her rest a little bit again same deal you got to let it rest you cannot cut them until you let it rest okay so and the idea of this is to show you then you can use the head of the tenderloin like you can use the tail the same exact way you can use the center cut all right we're going to let those guys rest okay friends so this one i rested a little bit longer so we're going to cut that one first and then we'll get this one we'll let it rest a little bit longer the pencils that i did for us are very simple just stocks right and shallots and uh and salt and pepper it's just a pencil this is nothing you can add a little cognac to this it'd be delicious little cognac right if you have some if you don't have any cognac then bourbon delicious and i know you got butter just put your butter in there friends just a little butter and remember when you're putting butter what you want to do right you want to mix it up right away so it does not have time to separate it doesn't have time to separate here friends so make sure you put it in right away right there you see and then at the end just a touch of a little tarragon then that's not a time to cook and this is just a plain pen sauce something you can do with that anything fancy right there your pen sauce put it right there on a good snake and at the last minute my friend you pour this make sure you scrape all that goodies out of there you pour this on top of your steak and let me tell you fabulous very simple okay let's look at those steaks now what do we do at this point after these guys rest we're now going to take the twine off it's very simple to take that twine off there is a you know there is a a reason for everything we do very simple to take that wine off flip it on the other side grab the the twine right there flip it this way and now you notices i'm pulling on it right so you pull and you cut you pull and you cut you pull and you cut you put it down put it down grab this and voila all in one piece all right we're going to do the same thing over there you grab it flip it on the other side you cut and pull cut and pull and you pull at the same area friends cut and pull cut and pull very very simple just like this so now we're going to cut the chateaubriand the center cut and then we're going to cut this guy too all right so the first thing you do is take this chaturang right there friends and radar you got a beautiful now you have a crust on the outside but it's perfectly cooked as far as amla as far as i like it it's perfectly cooked for me okay you want a more cooked you cook a little bit longer you want less cook you're cooking a little bit less right now i want to show you the whole idea was to show you about this guy this guy right there is uh it's the head that is attached to the rest of the body and that's what most people throw away there well let's throw that away we don't need it we don't need it we're going to make stew out of it no we're not we're gonna make a roast out of it and if you cut right into it you see right there my friends you also got the perfect cut right there you see now this piece right here remember we tied this guy together but if you notice carefully you can't really see you know i mean they cook the same but remember this was tied together this piece was tied together and you can't really tell it was tied together you see right there that's the whole idea of tying it really really really nice and tight you see and so the center cut the chateaubriand beautiful and this is the head that normally people tell you to make a stew out of it i don't make no stew out of it this is perfect so you can serve this with your um pen sauce that i just made a couple of minutes some vegetables some roast this is beautiful really simple so now remember you can use the whole tenderloin you don't have to use just the chateaubriand you can use the head and you can use the tail the way i showed you how to cut it that's it i hope you like this segment remember
