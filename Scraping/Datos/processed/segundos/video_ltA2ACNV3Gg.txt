guys welcome to my channel if you're new my name is din and i'm going to show you how to prepare your ingredients mix the spices and then cook the dish very simple method i'm going to use so please follow the instructions carefully so let's cook [Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel i'm chef dinh and today i'm going to cook you a beef curry now this is a delicious dish you can use any cut of meat to cook this dish i've used beef on the bone but if you don't like beef on the bone then just use just beef chunks and cook this curry it's absolutely delicious you and your friends will love it so i'm going to show you from scratch this one pot curry where you don't need any base gravy and i'm going to put some potatoes in with this you can put whatever vegetable you like so let's not waste any more time and let's start cooking [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to add two large tomatoes what i've done is cut them in half and also cut off the stalks so this way what we're going to do is let them cook for a little while in the steam and remove the skin this is a good good way to basically not have any tomato skins in your curry so try this method it works really well and very simple to use as well this beef recipe is enough for six people but i would serve it with a lentil or vegetable dish on the side and serve with polar rice these recipes you'll find as well on my channel and they go well together as well so give it a go [Music] now is the time where we would add our three cups of water and bring it to the boil and simmer for about hour and 20 minutes you may have to cook yours a bit longer or a bit less it depends on the cut of meat you're using so just fill the meat with your fingers to see if it's soft enough for you before you start to add your spices it's been hour and 20 minutes that uh this curry has been simmering away and mine is nice and tender and it's ready to add spices yours may take a little bit longer so if it does just carry on simmering for another 10 15 20 minutes uh what you will need and then start adding the spices i would suggest getting all your spices ready before you get to this process so that you don't delay with the cooking process at this stage we're going to add our vegetable i'm going to add potatoes because that's one of my favorite vegetables in the curry especially beef curry or meat curries i i do love my potatoes but you can add any vegetable you like you can also add carrot if you like but when you add carrot you need to add a little bit extra chili because the carrot is sweet so that will combat the sweetness so give it a good stir and uh let that potatoes break down the gravy even more to give it a nice smooth sauce so what we're going to do for the next few minutes just keep stirring it and breaking the onions down right that's it we're nearly ready now we're going to just add the water make sure it's boiling hot water we don't want to stop the process of cooking and then basically bring it to the boil and turn it right down on low heat and let it simmer for 20 minutes for the vegetables to cook and that's it job done this is my beef curry i hope you enjoy it please write in the comments what you think and if you haven't subscribed to my channel please subscribe and tell all your friends so bye for now and enjoy this beautiful beef curry [Music] you
