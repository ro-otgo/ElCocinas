i love sea bass no no you don't get i really love sea bass and i've eaten it a bunch of different ways but i've never had the opportunity to sit and think what's the best way to cook this so that it tastes the best until today of course i want to try to figure out what's the most amazing cooking procedure that makes the best sebas that's the goal and i want to make this an even playing field so i'm comparing apples to apples but i also want to take it to the next level so i'm not going to serve it up with a simple sauce no i'm gonna do it mediterranean salad you know all that goodness the tomatoes the roasted bell peppers the herbs all that the olives yes all of that we're gonna make it really quick though okay let's start by prepping it we wanna thinly slice up one shallot slice off the end slice it in half remove the outside peel and then thinly slice or julienne it set it to the side in a bowl next i have three garlic cloves and i still can't find my dain garlic press so give them a smash and then finely mince them set them to the side in a different bowl and now i have 10 each kalamata and frescatrano olives we're just going to slice them in half now i have two roasted red bell peppers i'm slicing them in half because they're a little bit big and then i'm going to julienne them from there set them to the side and now i have 15 or you could use 20 cherry tomatoes simply going to slice those in half as well last but not least i have one pound of baby potatoes golden yukons and reds now it's time to cook we're going to take those potatoes over to a large frying pan add in three tablespoons of olive oil turn the heat to high once it smokes we're going to add those potatoes in there we're just going to give them a quick toss cook it for maybe only two to three minutes remember these potatoes are small they're gonna cook quick now let's add in the shallots give them a toss for another minute you can start to see they're golden brown at this point now we're gonna add in our finely minced garlic followed up by adding in our olives next are roasted red bell peppers and then of course last but not least our tomatoes we're going to saute this together for about two minutes we're about medium high heat at this point and now what i'm gonna do is deglaze with a half cup of white wine this is going to add a lot of flavor here mix all of those ingredients together cook for a further one to two minutes then we want to season it well with salt and fresh cracked black pepper give it a stir until everything is combined and then once we're ready to serve it we're gonna finish it with two tablespoons of fresh chopped basil we're just gonna set this to the side and don't worry it's gonna stay warm this is a nice hearty base it will hold because the sea bass is gonna cook really really quickly speaking of sea bass i have two pounds of fresh skin on chilean sea bass chilean sea bass is buttery melt in your mouth slightly sweet firm fish that goes great with so many different things now in order to prep it up there are some bones that run straight through now some sites say you can use tweezers and pull them right out now they're way too big what i recommend doing is simply cutting around they run straight through the middle so slice on one side you can feel them with your fingers on the other side as well and then with the other side just slice it off yes you will lose some of the meat but that's just the cost of eating sea bass and just in case you missed it we're gonna keep the skin on there it's gonna help keep shape also help make sure it's moist and tender i definitely recommend doing it when i think of sea bass i have to go back to the year 2000 in culinary school we used to serve up dinner at the school restaurant called nicole i don't remember who came up with the dish but it was sea bass with a simple for blanc and then something called a blueberry guest streak which is really just like a sweet blueberry sauce so you get this nice lemony taste from the blanc and that sweet from the blueberry it was incredible i will never forget that as long as i live i think that's where my love for sea bass started okay now for the cooking methods here's the first one we are gonna grill this to perfection but what we first need to do is pat it dry on both sides very well with paper towels you must do this because seafood always likes to stick to things especially a hot grill at this point we're going to add on two tablespoons of oil then use some tongs i want to coat it around make sure it is completely coated in that oil we're going to season it well on both sides with salt and with fresh cracked black pepper yes even the side with the skin now we're going outside to a grill it is very hot in between 500 and 600 degrees fahrenheit it's gonna take in between four and five minutes per side for this to cook a good way to know when it's ready to flip if you can't pull it away from the grill it needs more time it's still sticking so after that time that five to six minute period give it a flip got some nice grill marks still intact perfect at the end i'm just gonna brush it with a little bit of unsalted butter add a little bit of fat and flavor to this and then at this point we're just gonna remove it to the grill we let it rest for one to two minutes before serving it up now it's looking good got some nice grill marks on there okay here's the next one pan searing is definitely art when it comes to cooking fish be sure to pat it dry just like in the last one season it on both sides with salt and pepper we're going over to a large saute or frying pan we're going to add in two tablespoons of oil turn the heat to high once it begins to lightly smoke we are gonna add our fish skin side up right to the center immediately turn the heat down to medium medium-high somewhere in between there add in one teaspoon of unsalted butter it's going to add fat help brown it up and help release it from the pan what i like to do after a minute or two is move it around all over the pan just like in my steakhole poi video to ensure that every square centimeter is completely golden brown after about five to six minutes we're gonna give it a quick flip yep perfect golden brown that's exactly what i was looking for and we're gonna cook it on the other side for five to six minutes this looks perfect we're gonna take it off and let it rest for one to two minutes before serving okay we are on to the last one be sure that oven is preheated to 450 degrees fahrenheit we are gonna bake this sea bass and just like in the first one we need to pat dry well on both sides we're gonna pour on two tablespoons of oil make sure it's completely coated and of course season both sides with salt and pepper however this one is going into a small saute pan if you have a non-stick pan great skin side down we're going to add on one tablespoon of melted unsalted butter i want to keep the playing field as even as possible going to the oven at 450 degrees fahrenheit it's going to take in between 12 and 15 minutes once it begins to break up i usually know that it's done this looks awesome you're going to put all of those fundamental techniques into practice with these three procedures now that everything's done let's quickly plate this up i'm just gonna divide that delicious mediterranean base that we made in between three different plates and then we're gonna add on our grilled sea bass our pan seared and then last but not least our baked sea bass and seriously every single one of these looks absolutely delicious it smells ridiculous in here so i'm not gonna waste any more time we're gonna start off with the grilled sea bass sea bass just melts in your mouth get a hint of smokiness from the grill and that little sear mark that char mark really adds a lot of flavor that's really really good i want to try some of this base too regardless you definitely need to make that that's super good goes really really well with that sea bass okay now we're gonna try the pan sear oh man so buttery so delicious right now this is the favorite i'm not sure if it's the butter we put in the pan that crispness on the outside it's moist it's tender that one's a winner so far let's get to the bait falls apart dang i mean that one is super moist it doesn't have that nice sear on the outside but it's tender i'm guessing the oven that keeps a lot of moisture in there that's really good all right you know the rules decision time this is a tough one i'm gonna go with the pan sear i think that crispness on the outside that nice brown sear mark just takes it to the next level second place baked last place grilled sorry grill sorry barbecue fans out there pan sears where it's at today and i'm telling you right now you have got to check out my best way to eat halibut honestly this sea bass would work perfectly in all of those halibut recipes i'll see you there
