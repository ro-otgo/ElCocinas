[Music] i made this fish carry not too long ago it turned out so great this feels like i went to the indian restaurant i hope you are able to try this recipe i know it is a real keeper and you will love it here are the ingredients i'm using and as always i'll list them for you in the description box so my fish of choice is going to be this white sea bass i have cut it up washed it pat it dry and to that i'm applying some paprika turmeric and some salt as my seasoning now you coat the fish with the spices turmeric powder can stain and it actually did stain my fingers it took me a few days to get rid of the stain so if possible wear a pair of gloves or use some tongs so you don't have to directly touch the fish with the turmeric on it make sure the fish is very well coated you want it to come out flavorful now i'll set this aside for 30 minutes to marinate [Music] so now let's get ready to make a sauce i'm going to put my garlic in my blender ginger already cut up i'm using two serrano chilies you can use one if you don't want this to be hot but i want it spicy and my tomatoes i'm gonna cut up so i'm just gonna quarter my tomatoes into the blender also going to cut up my onions so in my pan i'm going to add about three tablespoons of oil let's just say about four this is what we are going to fry the fish in so it's pretty much shallow frying and i'm using avocado oil the oil is hot so i'm going to start frying my fish [Music] [Music] we're definitely going to need to do two batches of the fish i'm going to chop my coriander while the fish fries [Music] [Music] the stock of the coriander has so much fragrance you really want to chop it up and add it to everything the fish has fried for about five minutes and it's time for me to turn them the white stuff you see on the surface is just the albumin of protein from the fish that just coagulated and shipped through the fish to come on the surface it is totally fine and you can leave this on or you can just try to get rid of it whatever really pleases you i'm going to remove the fish so i can fry the next patch [Music] now we're going to fry the rest okay we're gonna bring out the fish [Music] [Music] okay [Music] now we set the fish aside and make this sauce i'm going to put about three tablespoons of oil here to start making the sauce just about this much the oil is hot so i'm going to pour my blended ingredients here we're going to wait until this cooks all the way down i had to cover this to prevent it from splattering everywhere get in there i've allowed my sauce to keep cooking until now you can see some oil beginning to come to the surface it is almost all the way cooked and now i think i can add my spices to the sauce and then i'm using paprika so i've added that here and coriander i'm also going to add some salt definitely according to your taste now i'm going to mix it all up [Music] and let it cook so you want to cook your tomatoes and other ingredients all the way through dry out before you add your milk to it your coconut milk and so at this point it has dried out it's pretty much cooked i'm just going to add a little bit of water to help it cook through a little more before i add my coconut milk the recipe called for one cup of coconut milk what i have is more of cream so i'm going to start off by using half of what i have here and then we'll see how it goes i think i could pretty much use everything so i'm just going to put it on here stair yeah i think this looks perfect now i'm also going to thin this out with about a cup of water and i'm going to let it cook through about another eight minutes it is perfect time for me to add my garam masala which is like the icing on the cake as soon as this hits your sauce you just get that curry vibe it actually puts the curry in your carry it smells like you just entered into some good restaurant this is the real deal so i'm going to put the fish in now let it stay here for about 10 minutes to soak up the flavors so i'm just going to introduce all my flavorful oils back here and i think this looks a little bit thick i'm going to thin it out a little bit more i'm going to pour in here about half a cup of water so the fish cooks with some moisture and you know this is soft fish so it is not very hard fried so be careful when you stir so it doesn't it doesn't fall apart our curry is done at this point oils coming on the surface fish definitely must have soaked some of the flavors and i'm going to add in my coriander leaves just give it a notch to spread and mix up i'm gonna let this simmer for about another two to three minutes and my curry is ready our curry is done now and it's time to serve just look at how good it is looking delicious to let you know the verdict so let's do it this feels like i went to the indian restaurant the fragrance the flavor aroma you really need to try this now let's see the fish piece of that fish very soft and very tasty try this kindly give me a thumbs up and share and until i come your way next time with something delicious be loving be kind be happy delicious
