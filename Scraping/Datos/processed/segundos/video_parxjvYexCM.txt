[Music] hello and welcome to my channel in today's video I'm going to show you how to make a creamy garlicky mushroom sauce if you're new around here my name is Jack and I'm a chef by trade my goal for this channel was to share my knowledge with you consider subscribing to learn all the best recipes tips tricks and secrets thank you and let's get started to get this recipe started we're going to thinly slice and dice one shelah [Music] [Music] that guy's to transfer that to a bowl [Music] then here I have four cloves of garlic just going to take the root ends off and thinly slice these [Music] I'm going to transfer these to a boat then here I have 300 grams of Swiss brown mushrooms we're just going to come through and thinly slice these [Music] and I'm also going to put these ones in a bowl [Music] then we are going to find me chopped 2 tablespoons worth of afro parsley [Music] and it's finished preparing this sauce we're going to finely chop 1 teaspoons worth of time [Music] to start this sauce we're going to bring a large frying pan or a saucepan to a high heat I'm going to add two tablespoons worth of unsalted butter and to stop the butter from burning I'm going to add one teaspoon of olive oil [Music] going to allowed us to melt [Music] now that our butters melted I'm going to add our four cloves of chopped garlic and our one diced shallot going to mix these around and cook these for about 30 seconds then I'm going to add our 300 grams of mushrooms [Music] and mix that around again [Music] and I'm going to cook this down for six to seven minutes stirring or tossing the pan frequently and don't worry if you think it looks a little bit drier the mushrooms release quite a bit of moisture and you can start to see now that the mushrooms are reducing in size and releasing their moisture and I highly recommend using Swiss brown mushrooms in this recipe as they have so much flavor and I also bring off a nice color to the sauce and at this stage I'm going to add a small pinch of salt then after about six minutes I'm going to add two tablespoons of white wine but ain't going to cook this off for one minute just to cook the alcohol out of it and deglaze the pan which means pulling all of the flavors off the bottom of the pan back into the sauce with enjaiied to add our two tablespoons worth of parsley and one teaspoon worth of time [Music] and then we're going to add 400 milliliters of full fat cream [Music] going to mix over that first [Music] but I'm going to bring this to a boil then reduce the heat down to a medium and simmer away for fifteen minutes or until the sauce is nice and thick and during those 15 minutes we want to stir the pan frequently I'm going to turn the pan down to a medium and allow the sauce to reduce down and become nice and rich then after 15 minutes our sauce is reduced down by nearly half and it's nice and thick and looking really rich now going to turn it off the heat check it for seasoning we're going to give that a pinch of salt and a few cracks of black pepper just kind of stir that food just going to take that off the heat and now we have a a creamy rich garlic mushroom sauce this recipe is perfect by the steak over chicken with vegetables and a pie there's so much versatility to it I really hope you enjoyed this video and I was able to teach you something if you haven't done so already consider subscribing to my channel to learn all the best recipes tips tricks and secrets please like share and comment and if there's any recipes that you'd like to see me make please leave them in the comment section down below and I'll be sure to make them I hope you'll have a fantastic day thanks again for watching bye for now [Music]
