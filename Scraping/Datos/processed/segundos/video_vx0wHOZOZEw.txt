hello everyone welcome back to my channel in today's mouth-watering recipe i'm going to be showing you guys how to make my super easy super popular honey barbecue chicken wings a ton of people have already made this recipe from when i originally posted it on my blog four years ago and every single review has just raved about how incredible they are before we get started make sure to subscribe so you don't miss any upcoming recipes all right let's get into it first things first we need to clean our wings so add your chicken rings to a large mixing bowl then squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top [Music] next we're going to pour in some cold water and some white vinegar as always a link to the specific measurements and full printable recipe is in the description below i'll also make sure to leave a link in the comments [Music] refrigerate this for about half an hour and you'll see how it gets rid of all of the little bits and pieces and stuff that we just don't want on our wings after half an hour drain out the water mixture then place your wings on a paper towel lined baking sheet i hope you guys don't mind ways because we're going to be using another large sheet of paper towel to place on top of the wings and pat them dry you want your rings to be completely dry because it helps give us a nice crispy coating fold up the paper towel and continue to pat the wings dry now once they're nice and dry go ahead and transfer them to a clean mixing bowl in the meantime we're gonna throw together our seasoning mix in a small bowl combine equal amounts of salt pepper hot chili powder smoked paprika and garlic powder stir it together till combined then sprinkle it over your chicken rings a little bit at a time i don't do this all at once because i want to make sure every inch of every wing is covered so start with a little bit toss the wings and sprinkle some more seasoning on any empty spots you see once all your rings are nice and seasoned we're going to place them on an oven safe rack that's on top of a parchment lined baking sheet then bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 20 minutes after 20 minutes we're going to flip them around just so they can bake evenly you guys would like to see more chicken wing recipes just let me know in the comments below go ahead and pop that in the oven for another 25 minutes and in the meantime we'll make our super simple honey barbecue sauce first thing we're going to do is melt some butter now add your favorite barbecue sauce i use the original sweet baby raise but any kind will work [Music] then add your honey and a little bit of ketchup stir it all together until combined then let it simmer on low for about 10 to 15 minutes if you want to make your sauce completely from scratch i have a recipe for that too and i'll leave a link in the description below once the wings are all golden and crispy we're going to put them in another clean mixing bowl and pour that luscious sauce on top [Music] [Music] then we're going to use a wooden spoon to toss and completely coat the wings place them back onto the wire rack as you can see some of the wings just don't look saucy enough so i'm going to go back in with my leftover barbecue sauce and spoon it on top the wings of the oven placing them on the top rack for another seven to eight minutes until the sauce is beautiful and caramelized like so these wings are so good you guys i'm talking clean the bone good season to perfection and that honey barbecue sauce is absolutely to die for i just know you guys are gonna fall in love with this one let me know in the comments what you think about this recipe and don't forget to leave a like and subscribe and hit the notification bell so you don't miss a single video and i will see you guys in the next recipe thanks for watching you
