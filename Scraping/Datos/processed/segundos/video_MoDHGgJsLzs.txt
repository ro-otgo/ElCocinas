hey guys Chrissy a Caribbean pop calm with a quick and easy barbecue chicken in the oven I posted a picture of this on Facebook on the Facebook fan page by the way if you're on Facebook search Caribbean Potter come you'll see what I'm talking about beautiful pictures videos chat the works I posted a picture of mr. barbecue chicken on there and just about everyone was going crazy or that picture trust me it tasted even better than it looked so here we go this is going one more time in the oven I'm gonna put one more quote coat off barbecue sauce on there it's going back in the oven I mean it's safe this is one of those dishes gonna be very quick well not quick but simple because we're gonna put it in the oven for an hour hour and a half or so but here we go barbecue chicken in the oven remember if it's the first time watching me here on YouTube above click subscribe give the video the thumbs up or like it and below is where you're gonna leave me your comments show you boys some love and do those things please in a line oven proof baking this share I aligned it because once we start glazing this and it gets all sticky and everything with the barbecue sauce it's gonna be hard to get clean later on one chicken it's a chicken I cut up here into four pieces into quarters basically they're about three and a half pounds or so of chicken washed with lemon juice and water then I drain it patted dry now you'll notice in the skin is still on it this is going in the oven and I really need the skin to help insulate this while we cook it in the oven you can always remove that skin you don't have to eat it but trust me on this you need that skin on here for that sort of protective barrier on the chicken so it doesn't dry up very simple to put together guys here then my little dish here a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of ground black pepper half a teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice and half a teaspoon of ground mustard dry mustard I'm just going to give that a quick little make up in here there these fellas get to know each other nice and lovely OOP smells nice with that cinnamon and nutmeg and everything and all we're doing it's pretty much sprinkling it all over this chicken off-camera I'm gonna turn it around and do the same thing to the other side and I'm just going to pot it on there as well additionally you can need about four strands or four sprigs of fresh thyme just gonna break that dump it all in there we you can certainly chop it up and do your thing but I like it this week this is going in the oven at 375 degrees 375 degrees for 45 minutes after 45 minutes that's when your favorite barbecue sauce is gonna come in handy this is one of the juiciest oven barbecue chicken you'll ever taste so I'm gonna go ahead season the other side of this and I'm sticking in the oven for 45 minutes at 375 degrees it's been it's been 50 minutes since I put it in the oven 375 we're gonna do a couple things now first off if you notice at the bottom there's any extra fat or liquid what you want to do it's pretty much like this stuff here we're gonna spoon that out cuz you really want this to be dry of any sort of liquid any sort of fat before we start adding the barbecue sauce on there I've gone ahead and I've removed all that sort of liquid fat that was on the bottom off the pan here now I have my barbecue sauce with a brush all I'm gonna do is coat brush the chicken pieces generously because we really want this to really get sticky and gooey and glazed up and juicy and hey it's a wicked barbecue is doing here in the oven no no we're telling your neighbors and your friends cuz you know what let them think it did this for hours and hours and hours slow cooking and the grill outside they will know the difference trust me I'm just gonna stick it back in the oven Oh for 10 minutes then we're gonna take it back out flip it and do the same thing again it's been 10 minutes since it's been back in the oven with the barbecue sauce on it so what we got to do now is flip these pieces over and then we're gonna hit them with some of that barbecue sauce and stick it back in the oven one more time so all I'm doing and brushing it again generously with that barbecue sauce and it's gonna go back in the oven for 10 minutes so it's been another 10 minutes since I basted the other side with the barbecue sauce we're gonna do this one more time so we're gonna flip the chicken over back to the original side we had up at first and give it a nice thick coat of that barbecue sauce stick it back in the oven for 10 minutes nice glaze on it you may want to turn up the heat if you need to turn up the broiler to get it a nice dark golden brown luscious sticky color you're looking for what do you think so I'm gonna flip it over brush it one more time a barbecue sauce back in the yard so all I'm doing now is the final thick coat of barbecue sauce and I remember you using your favorite barbecue sauce the one from the bottle from the jar into the gourmet stuff do you think this one here is a honey garlic Dianna's if those of you in Canada will know what I'm talking about it's a lovely sauce I mean I say it's something quick it's fast we don't need to go ahead and make our own sauce or any barbecue sauce or anything you want this nice and thick and I'm gonna stick it back in the oven Oh for another 10 minutes until it gets nice and gluey and sticky and glazed up it's going back in the oven so remember if you want you can put this on the broiler setting now to really crisp up the skin and everything else but this is it guys it's going back in the oven one more time and I'll give you guys a peek of everything when it's all done it's not a nice the kitchen smells good I'm kind of drooling watching the niceness of this chicken here nice and coated shiny with that barbecue sauce the last couple of minutes I put it to Broyles I got a that sort of nice crispy skin with that barbecue sauce down there now remember we cook this with the skin on so you can remove the skin if you want to but trust me you won't be getting rid of that skin underneath nice juicy moist remember these chicken breasts here trust me on this it's gonna be juicy Chris yeah Korean food calm guys you're keeping me about from having my dinner now but anyways thanks for joining your boy in the kitchen show me some love spread the news
