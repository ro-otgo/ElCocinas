[Music] my big question is can i cook a fish supper using six ingredients in under five minutes well we're going to do this with one camera take no cheating five minutes on the clock let's click start right we are good to go five minutes lemon salt straight from the fridge you want to use lemon soul here because not only is this soul man yay but we are also going to get quick cooking fish and it's going to be delicious to make up this sort of salmonella which is a classic sort of french way of preparing salt we're going to add some salt and pepper to some flour season up that flour with a good generous bit of pepper essentially this is going to be the coating for this fish so you do want to be quite generous with us now give it a good pinch of salt and actually before i get cracking we need to get our pan on nice and hot with any of these recipes it is all about getting the pan really nice and hot so look we've got lovely bit of flour seasoned up and ready to go just give that a good mix through and make sure that it's evenly combined at this point looking good okay give it a little shake soul is with the skin on you want to keep the skin on it's lovely and it's great flavor and it's also going to give you a lovely crispy back to it so just coat it quite nicely in your flour give the hands a quick wash into that hot pan we're going to go in there with some butter few knobs of butter going straight into that pan we're also going to hit it with a touch of oil and the reason i'm doing that is just to make sure that it doesn't burn the butter doesn't burn now while that's melting down i need to check my time we are four just under four minutes looking good looking good give that butter a nice melt down this is why you need your pan on nice and hot very quickly and now that's melted down just grab up your fish shake off any of that excess flour and just pop it into the pan coating it in all that gorgeous butter look at that right get rid of the flour you don't need that anymore we are looking good hands getting a quick wash again essentially this someone yay is with a little bit of a difference i'm not using capers and you can use them if you want to but we are going to do this as a full meal so we have some lentils and some asparagus and i have a great little tip for quick cooking your asparagus just take a veggie speed peeler like this and take the end of the stock and just take off nice little slivers of that asparagus there is a tiny bit of waste but you know what this is quick cooking and we just have to crack on so take up your asparagus spears your fish is getting a gorgeous color i just want to make sure that we don't burn it i'm going to turn it down at this point slightly keep going with those asparagus spears really quick cooking veggies if you didn't want to do asparagus spoons you could use oh what would you use you could use some spinach some baby spinach would be perfect in here but you're only doing this for one person so nice little slivers of asparagus is exactly what we're after here and the speed peeler like this will just make life a little bit quicker and a little bit easier i love the fact that with a recipe like this it literally takes minutes and fish people forget this but fish is one of those things that just cooks super super quick so just shave up that asparagus we want to you know usualize the fact that we fish that cooks quick and use a vegetable that cooks really quick too so this is looking pretty good you can eat these no bother stick them in your garden be grand give that a nice shave and those peelings are now going to get put in alongside the fish but first we do need to turn it so at this point we should have a bit of a golden color on the fish which we do it's looking gorgeous turn up that heat we are now at one minute and 41 seconds i think we're going to make it but we just have to keep cracking through the asparagus asparagus goes in and around the fish here you want to get it just coated in those little bits of butter and just get them nicely tossed through they should soften down ever so slightly and while it softens down we're just going to clear down so asparagus is gone we've got all the excess the beauty of this five-minute meal is just how quickly it comes together the rest of the ingredients we're gonna need are a little bit of lemon juice some butter and we've got some lentils as well six ingredients fish asparagus butter lentils a little touch of flour it's all looking good little squeeze of lemon juice goes into the pan while we're cooking off the fish we're gonna get that fish which is now beautifully cooked out of the pan smells so so gorgeous right now make sure you get all the asparagus out there as well get that right there we're going to whack in a tiny touch more of that butter and get it melted down and we've got 44 seconds to go lads it's not looking good to finish this up but i'll keep going we have that fish beautifully cooked we have our lemon ready to go feeling the pressure a little bit with 30 seconds to go i'm hoping that brown butter will brown up let me turn up the heat okay this is looking good seasoned up bit of salt bit of pepper tiny touch and a squeeze of lemon juice once it goes nice and brown it's starting to get there come in and have a look at this because this is where the action is this is where the flavor is i've got 18 seconds okay gonna squeeze it with that touch of lemon juice make sure to get no pips in there give it a good sizzle this is looking good we're going to utilize this to make a gorgeous sauce we've got five seconds to go quick plate it up we've got those gorgeous lentils now with these lentils you can serve them cold or you can serve them hot we're going to get them straight on the pan i'm out of time i'm out of time i didn't make it quite but you know what we are nearly there we're going to serve this up when you've gone to the effort you want to make sure that you serve this up beautifully so grab up that gorgeous soul fill it stick them on the side get some of those gorgeous asparagus spears give it a nice little toss through little lemon wedge on the side gorgeous where all the action is brown butter and my friends that is a fish supper in just over five minutes [Music] you
