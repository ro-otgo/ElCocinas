here pan down back I've got a frying pan was worried about fryers stop the fryer just a Tesco special non-stick pan 11 pound 99 and cause the Box the cornflakes get the heat hog and work it up okay just a basic pan I'm shallow frying okay I'm not deep frying big difference Thank You Oscar literally agrees with it shallow firing the way therefore we take on less fat and more importantly the actual flavor is delicious now we're studying okay you want it almost sort of like a runny texture touch more beer okay you can make this batter without the beer okay now from there once you've got that a nice sort of liquid moving like that okay whisk you finger sleep i season it lightly okay with that texture pan down big pan down Meg 20 gin and tonics last night girl poured into sin no no

excuse me look white hand every piece for Miriam now look at two days gone thank you look at that butter beautiful you want the batter just dropping through the risk if he gets a little bit too heavy a special water in there look at the color in that curry powder gives that a really nice beautiful dark color now we have to dredge this let's get the fish in first I'm gonna season the fish first before we go into the flour cuz you can't see the fish once it comes out cuz that batter stills it in okay now lightly seasoned into the flour run it through those spices and then this is really important now okay knock off that flour so just feel next the right don't jump it okay now look from there take the fish and just literally drop that in yes okay don't get that oil too hot if it was too hot okay just thank you all sunflower oil and just put a tablespoon I'll call them there okay that's why I've started with shallow fry so there's so much more control over there yeah watch lift it up and then literally from side to side use the corner of the cod and this is so beautiful so fresh lay away from you put it in okay I'm just literally lay away now I've got to take it off the gas there's no need more heat quick wash their hands okay now like I said if you're probably gets too hot okay add a splash of cold on to it but look at that now look shallow fry turn the gas down and stick that back on there take a little spoon and just put the back of the spoon just face the fish and literally this is the exciting part about basting fish this special or a prime is shallow fry they get really nice and crispy now look at the color that back to pan down make how we do time hold please four minutes gone right potatoes just very quickly square that off means top and bottom okay and literally square it off so it's all nice and flat so is easy to cut and they come down here now we haven't got long so these gonna be tall skinny fries from there in and then from there look down hold them all together uniformed this is one potato but look at the yield of fries on there okay and then finally there now get them into a little piece of kitchen roll okay and Rob them okay when you rub them it gets rid of the start and the moisture okay and it helps to dry the potato batter now lift up to the side turn that over and then this be faced again now cello prime should take literally around three to three-and-a-half minutes now look at that beautiful color again clothing size and then its face now once you've got to color on there okay the fish that thing cooks in about three and a half minutes that's a nice and crispy and from there I'm going to take it out literally drain it aside put that onto a little piece of the paper okay and that gets rid of the excess fat and litter that's been go in the oven for about two minutes now the fries quack up the gas literally a touch of cold water in there because with a blank sheet potatoes first I've rubbed them nice and dry and look we're gonna go in into the same oil now you can see the difference now see how thin they are and he's gonna cut loose we - it's time please hold for Miss don't worry don't worry now they're in

thinner my eighth grade string source um okay that's a beautiful sauce I've got my lemon there and I see the exciting thing now when we start literally to shut a fire it's so much better deep fry fish
