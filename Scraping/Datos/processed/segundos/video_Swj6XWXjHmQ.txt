uh welcome back to my channel as always if you're not yet subscribed please remember to hit the subscribe button at the bottom and if it's your first time here today thanks for joining us welcome to my channel so salmon is a delicate fish so you want to be careful with the spices that you add into it so we are going to start by making a curry paste that is just some cumin some coriander some garlic everything goes into a small processor we process that and then we go into the pan and we go from there let's go ahead and start this [Music] so into a small blender bowl goes in one shallot two cloves garlic a small knob of ginger [Music] one green chili some green onions or scallions a teaspoon of cumin coriander [Music] a teaspoon of chili powder [Music] half a teaspoon turmeric [Music] one teaspoon garam masala half a teaspoon black pepper a teaspoon of salt some white of scallions goes in into our paste i'm also going to add some of the peeling here just take out the peel without the hawaii this adds very good flavor roughly chop this this goes into our small bowl here i'll cut this lemon add some of this juice [Music] i will add just a touch of rice wine vinegar here like a half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of sugar so this give it a bath to help this process i'm going to add just a touch of water here [Music] so there you have it so after a few buzzes here we have a nice paste here so this goes into our pan [Applause] so for our salmon i have a about pound of salmon here i'm going to cut this almond into some nice pieces here so i'll have that cut that in half [Music] and then cut this in half just a good amount for this aside we'll hand the stove and start cooking add a tablespoon of some vegetable oil onto our preheated pan and into the pan straighten we are going to add our paste i need only like two tablespoons of this the rest of the paste i'm going to freeze and i can use it later so the idea here is to cook this paste to start developing the flavors that we need for our curry this takes about three minutes on medium high heat you wanna keep stirring this so that it doesn't burn so once this comes together i'm going to add the rest of our spices so the same spices that we used to make the paste so that comes together i have some whites of scallions here or green onion i'm going to add them in these are two small tomatoes plum tomatoes nicely right add them [Music] and then cook them smells good here so we want to cook this until the tomatoes are cooked down this is to take about five minutes also the key in curry uh always is how you make the paste or the sauce once you make the sauce you can take it whichever direction that you wish we are using salmon today but you can certainly switch it to any fish that you have a cord tilapia any fish that you have and mostly white fish they work perfectly for this kind of recipe our tomatoes have nicely softened here i'm going to add one cup of tomato puree or tomato sauce and then give this a couple a couple minutes to another five minutes i cook it down bring it all together [Music] just added some stems of cilantro i always save them just to cook with them the leaves i use them for garnishing our sauce has nicely baked i'm going to heat it with just some water here about a half a cup put a lid on this and cook it for about 10 minutes on low heat after about 10 minutes you want to open the lid here give it a nice stir always be careful so that it doesn't scorch the reason i'm pre-cooking the sauce here or partially cooking the sauce here is because our fish doesn't take long to cook this looks nice and beautiful so i'll check for seasoning oh this is good i will bend it just a little bit more just slightly at this point i'm also going to heat it with just like a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce just a touch of salt and pepper remember how the sauce tastes here is poured at the whole dish will taste like so the fish here will only absorb the flavors that are already in here so you want to make sure that the flavors at this point they are right before you add the fish one more time seasoning oh perfect i will lower the heat so i will come in here and lay our salmon in here just carefully just late [Music] we are basically just going to poach the fish in this sauce this takes about five six ten minutes depending on the size of the fish it doesn't take long [Music] it's time to open the lid here and check where our curry is okay that looks beautiful we'll check our fish this is a shop right here so our fish seems to be ready here i'm going to heat this with some greens of scallions some parsley just remember when you're cooking always uh keep on checking for seasoning as you go oh that tastes perfect [Music] so there you have it
