i have some garlic paste you can use fresh garlic if you like one yellow onion some carrots some celery and some potatoes of course guys you always want to clean your produce before we get to work so with these red potatoes i'm going to leave the skin on but that's totally optional if you want to remove it go ahead we're going to quarter them up depending on the size of the potatoes you just want to make sure they're all about the same size that way they cook at the same rate and get nice and tender in our stew so just take your nice sharp knife and quarter those potatoes up and set them aside and then we'll do the same thing with our celery we're just going to cut them into nice bite-sized pieces and then set them aside as well same deal with the carrots make sure you peel and clean those carrots and then we're going to dice them up into bite-sized pieces also looking good this knife is making easy work of these veggies make sure you sharpen your knives guys then we're going to dice up one onion as always guys specific measurements and ingredients can be found in the description box below so don't forget to check that out this stew is packed with flavor absolute comfort food perfect for a nice chilly day or hell i'd eat this any day of the week honestly all right moving on to the star of the show the beef here we have some beef stew meat that you can find at your local grocery store or you can just chop up a chuck roast when you're shopping for this beef you want to look for the intramuscular fat these white lines of fat that you see throughout the meat that's called marbling that's going to indicate that there's a nice fat content on this meat and it's going to get nice and tender for you while we braise it in our stew this is about 2 pounds of chuck roast we're going to heavily salt the beef we're not going to add any more seasoning to it at this point because we're going to sear it over high heat and when you do that a lot of those other seasonings burn up like the pepper or the herbs those tend to burn over high heat so that's why we're just going down with a little salt right now just to begin flavoring the meat and we'll add all of our seasoning a little bit later now we have our dutch oven you can use a skillet for this also adding a little avocado oil working over medium-high heat here and then we're just looking for some color to develop on this chuck roast place the meat down into the skillet give it a minute or two to develop some nice color or some crust let's take a look there we go say it with me guys looking good then we're just going to flip that over we want to brown this on all sides about five to eight minutes in total leaving all of that delicious fawn at the bottom of the pan for us to get up later if you want to make this in the crock pot guys you can just go ahead and sear your meat in a skillet and then cook the veggies as you're going to see me do in a minute and then just transfer everything on over to your crock pot if you like once the meat is nice and brown we're going to remove it add in our fresh veggies along with a little bit more fresh avocado oil give them a little stir around as you can see we left our celery out because celery cooks really quickly so we're going to add that at the end so right now we just have the onions and the carrots in there going in with two tablespoons of garlic paste along with two tablespoons of tomato paste and one tablespoon of better than bouillon beef base you can just use regular old beef bouillon if you can't find that stuff get in there give everything a nice mix allow those flavors to come together like a family reunion your house is gonna be smelling so good right now tell your wife to thank me later looking good now we're going in with a couple tablespoons of all-purpose flour this is gonna be thickening agent for our stew so just mix that in until the paste forms and that raw flour taste is cooked off it usually takes about a minute or two you want to reduce the heat to about medium when you're doing that and then we're going in with three cups of beef stock once that beef stock hits the pot we're going to increase our heat to high to get a nice rolling simmer going that way that flour absorbs into the liquid starts to thicken things up get everything off the sides just to make sure nothing burns scrape the bottom of the pan as well we don't want anything sticking and then we're just going to simmer this for a bit as always guys specific measurements and ingredients can be found in the description box below going in with some fresh herbs there we have some rosemary thyme two bay leaves and the world's worst word sauce right here gonna add a lot of flavor though now we're gonna add back in that beef give that a nice mix cover with a lid and we'll let that simmer on medium low for about an hour and a half or until that beef starts to get tender you always want to give it the fork test to make sure it's nice and tender during the last 30 minutes that's when we'll add in our potatoes and celery go ahead and cover with that lid pop it in the oven on 300 degrees or just simmer it on your stovetop for like i said an hour hour and a half check it periodically just to make sure everything's going as planned and then for the final 30 minutes that's when we're adding in those potatoes and that's celery give that a nice mix make sure everything's well combined and then we're going to taste for seasoning and adjust the seasoning into our palette rather than going in the youtube comments and complaining looking good all right let's go ahead and test one of these potatoes we see that the potatoes are fork tender that's a good sign gotta check the beef also you're gonna watch me struggle here a little bit so feel free to make fun of me i'm a big boy i can take it there we go make sure you fish out those rosemary and time stems nobody wants to eat that stuff but you can see the beef is nice and tender as well now it's time to add our seasoning as always guys make sure you season to taste i'm going in with a little salt pepper garlic onion powder a little cayenne pepper if you want to increase the spice factor a bit and just taste as you go and adjust accordingly you can see things have thickened up a bit now i'm going in with some frozen peas for the last 10 minutes if you don't like peas you should grow up all jokes aside guys if you don't like peas you can feel free to leave them out no big deal i do enjoy the peas and i think it adds a nice bit of color as well to the dish and that my friends is a beautiful bowl of beef stew brace yourself for a trademark money shot followed by a taste test because you know i gotta get in there and try this packed with veggies tons of flavor also some parsley for color all i need now is a spoon here we go a plastic spoon i might add let's make sure we get a piece of that beef let's get some potatoes and carrots on there
