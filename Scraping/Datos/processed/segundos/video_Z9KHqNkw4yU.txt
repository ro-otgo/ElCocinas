thing delicious cold hot i don't care what they are they're delicious okay real quick my friends let me show you um i use yukon gold potato use whatever kind of potato you want the idea is to get them like this you see cut them like this all right so you cut them we're going to make a hole in there and then the inside we're going to put some cheese these are good let me tell you guys i love those potatoes i could eat three of them easy so let me show you first thing we're going to do folks we're going to cut the ends up all right we're going to cut the ends and make sure they are parallel to each other parallel okay that means they're straights right and then what we're gonna do now we're gonna cut them so they look nice okay and uh so we go like this and we're gonna give it a side nothing really fancy just try it when you cut them to make the same size um edge if you will you see look and if you have to cut a little bit extra cut a little bit extra it's okay you know this is um we want to make them look nice you can put them with a fancy dinner for you know look no big deal right just so far so good if you don't have enough of a surface let's say you don't have enough of a surface you can cut a little bit off and then boom you see now if it's not straight enough for you you can straighten it oh yeah you can play with it a little bit have fun with it it's not that big of a deal and now how do we get the hole in there we take a melon bowl cutter my friends melon ball cutters those are really simple look you go in there like this and you go deep deep deep deep and you go in there like this right easy you can take this and saute them they're cool they're really cool and then you go inside and make a little bit bigger hole but be careful with the edges friends you don't want to hurt the edges right the edge is good right so boom very simple right now let's say you got big potatoes cut them in half right and you can still do the same deal but then i'll show you if you cut them in half then you got to play with it and do the same deal you see look see same deal now they're not going to be quite as pretty when you get them from a half than they are when you get them from from around potatoes but you see look okay they're not exactly as pretty but look we're still oh look at it mama mia this one is there you go okay so now look we take it and make a hole and bam who got the same deal all right so now if you make them in advance those guys right there let me just put this aside because i don't need any more than what i got let me just remove all the stuff i got here my friends all right i got an oil i have my olive oil right here and i want my oil to be at 365 degrees i want it to be hot right i'm almost there so if you make them in advance you want to put them you want to dry them really really good dry i'm really good with paper towels put them in water get ready the extra starch clean them up keep them in the water if you do them keep them in the water okay if you do them in advance that is right and then you're gonna put a little salt and pepper on them nothing special make sure they're super dry salt and pepper right and then what we're gonna do we're gonna get a beautiful golden brown with some um uh uh uh i use a garlic olive oil but use whatever olive oil you want right put them up in the oil make sure it's hot if it's not hot then uh wait a second oh it's good it's hot yeah it's hot i just want to give them some little colors that's all i want give them a little color and then we're going to put them in the oven and we're going to cook remember they raw right let me tell you something this we used to do them at the restaurant so i can clean up because i hate to work in a dirty kitchen ah there you go extra salt and pepper uh those let me tell you at the restaurant they were big success friends big big success what we're gonna do we're gonna put them in a um let me put this right here with a little bit of chicken stock just a little chicken stock so i don't make a mess right we may put a little bit more later maybe just put a little bit more right now right a little chicken stock remember my chicken stock let me take it out of the way so the camera are not uh how are we doing here i'm not putting this in the middle am i no that's good a little salt and pepper and a chicken stock then we're gonna flavor our chicken stock friends with some fresh thyme and some garlic and don't be afraid to put a lot of garlic it's gonna it's gonna give a little bit of flavor it looks like a lot of garlic but don't worry it doesn't give that much flavor it takes a while okay then what we're gonna do friends we're gonna flip them we're gonna keep an eye on them we don't want them to be too golden brown see this guy right there is nice and don't worry about the side of it the side of it will get their color when they are in the oven and even if they don't get too much color hey you come back over here you see a little bit more a little bit more see they're getting their friends we want them to buy some nice color now you see why it's very important to make sure then they are um parallel this is my geography class parallel i used to get confused parallel horizontal in english i got it so confused for so long i would tell people things are parallel when they were arizona i told them they're horizontal when they were parallel and uh they got all confused actually let me tell you you should have heard me when i bought my restaurant 1976. july 26 1976 i'll never forget before i bought my first restaurant i was 24 years old and i oh mamma mia look at me i'm talking talking talking you see you come back over here see okay that's okay it's a little uh suntan a little bit of suntan here you see that's okay um and i bought the restaurant and my english was very bad very bad very bad and i bought a restaurant and then it was a lovely lovely restaurant it was called zenni's years ago and i turned it into a french restaurant but when i bought it it was a fondue restaurant they're specializing in fondue and the staff was as lovely as they were and they didn't they didn't understand anything i said to them it was difficult to run a kitchen when uh when nobody understood what you were talking about let me tell you there we go friends that's it so i am much better today with my my english much much better here we go that's it okay so you see a little squeeze here but that's okay i don't care i don't care we are mount friends all right so now look this guy is ready to go right a little more fresh thyme i'm gonna put them in a 325 degree 350 degree oven just like this that's all i'm gonna do okay they're gonna go in the oven now the oven is hot no more than three just do 300. just do 300 then you don't have to worry about it how long do you cook them for you cook them until they are soft with a with a fork than the fork tender right then i'm gonna make a little mixture with cheese now you don't have to be using all those cheese okay brie i removed the rhyme of the debris uh goat cheese i i love uh no this is this is um um yeah this is goat cheese i have two goat cheese i don't need two goat cheese little little cream cheese or um or mascarpone cheese that'd be great right a little garlic a little garlic a little bit of chopacity up little chopped pasta not not much and then what we're gonna do make sure those cheeses friends are well mixed together we're gonna put some fresh black pepper cracked black pepper we're gonna put a little salt okay and then we're gonna make this mixture right there friends debris is gonna be so important take your time to mix this take your time to mix it i'm gonna take a little more time to do it off camera and then i'm gonna take it i'm gonna put them in a pastry bag and when they're out of the oven we're gonna do one more thing to them we're gonna put the cheese in it and we're gonna put them back in the oven for a few minutes so cool thing to do you can make them way way in advance when they are and when you serve dinner all you got to do is pop them in the oven just for a few minutes to reheat them they are amazing i promise you you're going to love them so we're going to wait until they come out of the oven and then i'll show you how i stuff them all right so we're going to wait it's probably going to take about 45 minutes i'm not sure exactly how long we're going to time it right now because i never timed it when i made them in a little pot like this so we're going to find out and i'll tell you exactly how long it took to make everything i made about eight of them okay so i'll be back in a few minutes okay friends i took them out a few minutes ago you gotta let them cool just a little bit so you need to handle them because you see you see some of the stocks is in there right there or your water sometime you want to take them carefully carefully and you flip them you see you just flip them like that all right so here's what i'm gonna do friends i'm gonna do that to all of them and i'm gonna let them rest until because they're still quite hot i'm gonna let them get cool a little bit like maybe uh affair and this process you'll have to do but that's okay because you can make them all ahead this is not a potato the kids are hungry oh let's make some stuffed potatoes it's something you make in advance for a fun dinner or a very special dinner party all right so i'm gonna do all this and we'll come back i'll show you how i put the cheese in there okay okay friends well they rested a little bit long enough anyway uh for me to be able to handle them you know there's no more water inside um and you want to keep some of the chicken stock i wash the dish because i'm too anal so i i have to wash the dishes i mean nuts all of them anyway i got it cleaned up and then i saved some of that beautiful broth in there because you want to keep a little moisture underneath right now the cheese friends i put it in um in a pastry bag i got those disposable pastry bags if you don't have one of those you can you can use a very small ice cream scoop if you have it uh if not you're gonna have to do with a spoon or or get one of them baggies and put the cheese in a corner of it and then you just you see you can just do it like this it's e it's easy when you see me do it with a pastry bag you're gonna go ah it's pretty easy to do it this way right and you just go right here i just want to make sure that i'm not in the middle of the camera but look see right there and you put it in there now don't be afraid friends you want to put a lot of cheese so you put your pastry back in the bottom until it stops puffing up you see you want the potatoes to be full full full now it all depends of course how much cheese you like in your potatoes now if you like a lot of cheese you want to you want to really be healthy with this if you like a lot of cheese friends and you want you want to make a bigger hole but be careful be careful friends because if you put too much um if you put too big of a hole the potatoes are going to be very fragile because you know they're cooked right that's the whole idea right so then what we're going to do we're going to bake them and uh and and then when it's golden brown we're ready to eat them so then a party you got them all ready like that and you put in your steak you're putting you whatever it is they're going to require defense like those right now are still hot so they're not going to take that long at all to uh to get ready to be served but if you take them out of the fridge you want to put them in a warm oven like 250 275 until they're golden brown and until the cheese is nice and hot then you you taste it inside and they're ready all right we're gonna go in the oven now all right let's go let's put them in and voila we'll be back when they're ready okay friends now they are ready now what i'm going to do is uh let's put a chop a little church opacity to make them nice and give them a brightness a brightness a little freshness on and uh voila right a little bit right there this guy didn't get any right right okay so now um now they're ready to eat uh by the way i just wanna let you know the cheese left over i added on a crackers for lunch today at cheese and crackers yeah cheese and crackers it's delicious i'm not gonna have one otherwise i can't speak but it's delicious so yeah you make some extra cheese let me tell you okay i'm going to take one out of it so i want to show you the inside friends but they're going to be a little hot so be careful be careful be careful you know you see you you really got to keep the bottom of this thing moist uh it's nice okay oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so when you break them and you see that it stays so you see the cheese the the cheese came up a little bit you want to make sure you fill them up all the way okay now you can also put a bit of parmesan or vagina but you have to be careful because the parmigiano reggiano is going to um to brown really really really fast so you see the cheese is melting it's coming out but you're not supposed to eat them like that you're supposed to just cut them and just yeah no i gotta wait until they're not so hot fantastic for a dinner party i hope you make them my friend i really enjoy making them for you remember
