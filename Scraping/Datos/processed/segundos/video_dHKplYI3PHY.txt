hey folks this your boy Jay rapid filling back with another video Philly boy Jay Philly boy Jay back in the building and today I'm gonna be making some pork chops now I did a video like this on my previous channel which is still available by the way PBJ show and I've also done pork chop recipes in the past I'll show you guys how to make mother baked pork chops and I showed you guys how to make smother fried pork chops this recipe is sort of like smothered fried pork chops I said we're not going to be coating the pork chops with flour okay we're gonna be frying them without flour but yeah you want to need five pork chops and you're going to need assi medium cut pork chops they probably don't refer to them as medium cut they usually only refer to them as thick or thin cut but these are in between thick and thin okay do not get thick cut pork chops for this recipe unless you're an experienced cook and you know how to get them nice and tender all right make sure that your pork chops are medium or thin cut okay and you're going to need five of them and we're gonna rinse the funk off of these pork chops I don't care what nobody saying people try to tell you that oh you ain't supposed to rinse me because of the spread bacteria listen this soothes my mind okay because I just can't bite me or put me in my mouth if I rinse it all with some salt and water first also salt and lemon juice or some salt and vinegar so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna rinse these pork chops off we're gonna remove some of the excess fat and we don't get the cooking now we ain't gonna move all this fat because the fans would give you food what it give it flavor that Philly boy Jay you know I made my food Billy stop Billy is a soulful city we are about flavor okay so waiting taking all of this fat off but we will be taking some off okay so let's do that now because we're not deep-frying knees I'm definitely doing some like look at all that right there come now look at all that that water is dark and dirty and I don't want all that floating in my or you okay I ain't gonna let don't owe you that I'm cooking my food and remove the funk I'm gonna remove it before I put it in there you know me so that's just my take on a cleaning of music but just want to rub it rub the salt water solution up against the chops like that and that's pretty much it you gonna take them out a season we're going to be using some black pepper some paprika I like that freaking because I like the color that it gives food so I put paprika on pretty much every meat that I cook if you guys notice we're going to be using some garlic powder some onion powder and some parsley flakes the parsley flakes give it a nice look it's just for decoration purposes more so okay and the paprika now for taste we're going to be using celery salt I use celery salt because I like my pork chops to have that subtly flavor if you don't have celery salt you can use adobo seasoning or salt okay or either seasoning salt all right so you can substitute the Sun result with a lot of different seasonings just make sure a has salt in it all right unless you can't have salt so these are the seasonings that you're going to need let's move on it's about the other ingredients we're going to be using you're going to need some chicken broth so there are pork chops have like a nice thin gravy and it's not going to be much gravy left over when we're done cooking the pork chops all right just gonna have a nice thin gravy or like a wetness okay to it um you want to need a small onion you want to need some margarine or butter and some cornstarch okay so make sure you have those ingredients alright guys so first thing that you're going to do is you're going to cut your onions and you're going to slice them into thin pieces all right so that's the way you want your onions in look we're going to move on down and create our slurry ok guys so here is our broth into your bra you're going to add your cornstarch okay and therefore once you stir this in stir it in until the cornstarch dissolves like that there okay guys so here are our pork chops we rinse them all so now we're going to season them and I'm going to add my celery salt first okay now I want them to be well seasoned so that's the celery salt we're going to add our onion powder and I just season one side and then rub it one to both sides okay um here is our garlic okay so drop it here's our free condoms when we give it a beautiful color and again for the full recipe with all the detailed instructions cooking time in measurements visit my website Billy Jay cooking dot-com okay here is our parsnip links and that's not least we're going to add some black pepper one a massage all of these seasonings in on both sides besides it everyone alright guys those are you well seasoned pork chops and they look well seasoned don't they I see the total bad boys 20 and you could tell that they are going to be extremely extremely flavorful because of silly folks we like our food to have flavor so we make sure that we season it not too much but breviary well let's move over to the stove now okay guys so we're going to be cooking our pork chops over medium-high heat if you have a dialer on your stove place it on about a seven okay that's about medium-high and I use this instead of for you because I like the flavor that it gives the foretop want that milk should go to add your hon you want a caramel a boon about a minute or two now we're going to add our pork chops and if I go up to brow down for little while Hey all right we're gonna turn our push off over let them round on the other side ok so now we're going to go ahead and add costs Larry and look at the color because we browned it and also we seasoned it with paprika we didn't need to add like any gravy master or anything to darken the gravy look at that some beautiful color we gotta add a thing right so just let this go for about 20 to 25 minutes you can cover it with a lid you want to get real tender and you're just going to cook this until the gravy cooks down a little more alright and that's pretty much it so I'll get back to you guys once our pork chops are all done okay and actually I think I'm going to cook it on medium heat not low medium okay I'm cooking on medium heat get back which one is done okay guys so our pork chops are done in the way that I make my pork chops when I'm making it this way is I always cut the pork chops fall once the gravy cooks down so you should be left with a rubbery thin gravy okay so we're going to cut the fire off now because they are done and we're going to get ready to play them this recipe it's really good with like eight noodles or rice okay but I'm getting ready to grow up and I'm gonna run these down with the hot sauce all right guys here are our pork chops these are gosh you gotta try this recipe these are amazing making it this way hmm I don't know what's my favorite way to make pork chops
