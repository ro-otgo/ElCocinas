hello everybody it is Michael Brownstein here with the food and wine Life channel and I'm here with their beautiful ever play and today I am going to make buffalo wings in an instant pot air fryer with a homemade sauce so let's get into it [Music] all right the list of ingredients today is very simple and very basic we're going to be making buffalo wings and so we've got a pound of wings which is about 10 wings right here we're gonna put some garlic powder a little salt and some pepper and then we're going to put them in the air fryer for 28 minutes and then when they come out we're gonna mix half a stick of butter put some crystals hot sauce you can use any hot sauce you want but I like this one and mix those two together and coat the wings and we're gonna dig in so let's get on with it so our first step is we're going to take These Wings and I'm gonna put a generous amount of garlic powder on them maybe like a teaspoon maybe a little bit more whatever your taste is put a little more then put a little pepper and a little salt [Applause] and we're going to stir them up real good and then we're fixing to take them to the air fryer and let the air fryer do the work for us so this is a very easy recipe so what we're going to do here is take some avocado oil spray and just spray a little bit in the instant pot air fryer I believe this one's called a Duo and then I'm going to take the wings and literally put them in there and try to put them in a single layer and then we're going to take the lid put it on and we're going to hit the airfry button and it's already set for 28 minutes and we're going to hit start and we're gonna let it do its magic and we're gonna be right back after that to coat it with our sauce so we're at the 14 minute mark and I'm gonna check on these wings so what I'm going to do is take the top off and put it on the protect it thing so it don't hurt the counter and I'm just literally going to flip These Wings 180 [Music] so they can cook evenly and then I'm going to finish cooking them and then come back and make the sauce so we're back and we're fixing to enjoy some great wings buffalo style so what we're going to do is we're going to take that butter that I melted we're going to put it in a mixing bowl and then what we're going to do we're gonna put some of this Crystal hot sauce in there pretty generous amount whatever you like for your liking you can alter this any kind of way you want you can put a little brown sugar or honey or or more garlic Cajun season whatever you want but basically I serve those two ingredients together and literally I just dropped the wings in one at a time like that and then probably stir them around a little bit like this and then we're gonna be back and plate them up and tell you what we think be right back so we're back in the beautiful miss ever plated it up and we're fixing to dig into them something I've always been told though is you can tell how compatible you are with somebody by who teases the wings and who chooses the flats so if you both choose the flats then you'll be fighting over the flats all the time but if one chooses the um drummies like Evan usually does yes I love the drummies and I love the flats so we don't fight so we don't fight so let's get into it looks what looks delicious Michael yeah we're fixing to find out yes hmm um that's great flavor that's that's good amount of heat oh it's it's so good it's better than in the restaurant oh yeah and it's keto friendly too yeah very keto friendly there's no sugar or anything in there so well we're gonna wrap this up but we hope this helps somebody and I hope you all enjoyed our recipe till next time
