[Music] hello guys welcome back to cooking with claudia today i'm showing you how to make this delicious steak and peppers recipe this is such an easy stir-fry recipe it's very simple it takes no time at all this recipe also does well when frozen so later in this video i'm gonna show you how i preserve and freeze this recipe for future use this video is kindly sponsored by fresco automatic vacuum sealer this is a fully automatic hands-free design food vacuum sealer that can be used to preserve all kinds of food materials later in the video i'll show you how i use the vacuum sealer to freeze and preserve the steak and peppers let's get started with the recipe for this recipe i'm using two pounds of flank steak this type of steak is very good for stir-fry recipes because it always comes out juicy when you're cutting up your steak make sure you cut it against or across the grain cutting the meat this way will make it more tender and juicier when cooked and you want to make sure you cut your meat into thin strips just like i'm doing once i've cut up all the steak i'm going to transfer it into a big bowl then we're going to marinate it i'm pouring 2 tablespoons of olive oil onto the steak i'm also adding two tablespoons of soy sauce a table and a half spoons of honey two cloves of minced garlic and half a teaspoon of minced ginger i'm adding half a tablespoon of adobo a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and a table and a half spoons of corn starch next we're going to mix everything together make sure you mix in very well we want the marinade to get on every single piece of meat then we're going to let this marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to soak in all those delicious flavors don't forget to cover your bowl okay guys while the meat is marinating we're going to prep some vegetables i'm going to cut my vegetables off camera so i cut up one medium onion one large red bell pepper and one large green bell pepper i also minced three cloves of garlic and about half a teaspoon of fresh ginger i'm going to set the cut up vegetables aside then we're going to mix together the stir-fry sauce in this bowl i have half a cup of chicken broth into that i'm adding 2 tablespoons of soy sauce a table and a half spoons of corn starch and a quarter teaspoon of black i'm mixing everything together then i'm going to set it aside for later so once we have all the prep work done and out of the way we're going to start cooking so over here i have my wok heating up over high heat into that i'm adding about three tablespoons of olive oil we're going to start cooking the meat first so once it's done marinating take it out of the fridge then as soon as the oil gets very hot and smoky you're going to toast the meat into the pan try not to overcrowd your pan you can cook your meat in two or three batches in order to get the perfect sear arrange the meat in a single layer then cook it for one minute on high heat after one minute you can start turning them over they should have a nice golden brown sear just like that cook the other side for one more minute you can toss it around a little just like i'm doing then as soon as the meat is no longer pink you can take it out of the pan and set aside for later i'm going to place the rest of my meat into the pan follow the same steps as soon as the meat has a nice sear i'm going to take it out of the pan and set aside for later [Music] next you're going to clean out your pan a little make sure you get rid of all the burnt bits because they might make the stir-fry bitter i'm going to add a little bit of olive oil to the pan then toss in the minced garlic and ginger cooking on medium heat i'm going to stir in the garlic and ginger continuously and let them cook for about a minute to infuse the oil with your flavor i'm going to crack in a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and let that cook together with the garlic and ginger frying garlic ginger and black pepper is really flavorful next i'm going to toss in the cut up onion red and green bell pepper you're going to turn your heat to high then cook the veggies until they're as soft as you want them i'm seasoning the veggies with some black pepper and just a little bit of salt don't go crazy with the salt because the stir-fry sauce and the meat have enough salt in them i like my veggies soft but a little crunchy so i cooked them for about four minutes once the veggies have softened a little i'm going to pour in the stir-fry sauce stir it in a little the sauce is going to thicken right away then add in the cooked flank steak still cooking on high heat i'm going to set everything together and cook for about 30 seconds until all the flavors come together and since we're cooking on high heat make sure you stir continuously that way nothing burns okay guys and this is the final look you guys look at how beautiful and delicious this meal looks it smells so good this meal is best served with rice so make sure you have some rice already cooked this steak and peppers recipe came out packed with all the right flavors the meat is juicy and tender i'm gonna leave all the ingredients and measurements in the description box and stay tuned because i'm about to show you how i freeze this recipe with my fresco vacuum sealer this food vacuum sealer can be used to preserve both dry or moist foods it comes with these bags for storing food so i'm going to grab one then fill the bag up with some food once the bag is filled i place the edge into the opening of the vacuum sealer the vacuum sealer has multiple functions to choose from you can select dry for dry foods but this recipe is moist so i'm selecting moist once you make the selection it will automatically vacuum out all the air from the food once the vacuuming is done the seal function will automatically and securely seal the bag once this is done i just store this in the freezer for up to three months i like vacuum sealing foods because it holds in the moisture flavor and juices of the food so when you go to eat this three months later it still tastes and smells good i also use the fresco vacuum sealer to seal all my fresh meats like chicken or beef that way they don't get dehydrated or freezer burns when i freeze them i highly recommend this vacuum sealer it's really good i'm gonna leave all details in the description box together with a 40 coupon code to save you some money a big thank you to fresco for sponsoring this video and thank you guys for watching i will see you in my next video bye
