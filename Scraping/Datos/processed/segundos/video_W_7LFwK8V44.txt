there friends we're going to make that french cheeseburger we're going to use brioche bread caramelized onion brie cheese delicious first thing i got to do i got to make the party and for the party friends i like to use short ribs take the bones out and chuck roast i like to grind my own meat but you know if you want to want to grind your own meat just get yourself the butcher to do it or you can get one of them hand cranked you know they're like 29 30 bucks they're really good all right so we're gonna do a little bit of rib a little bit of short rip and a little bit of chuck roast oop chuck roast up there you go that's your clothes hey let me know ribs little bit of roast so you want to mix them up so i like about 20 percent fat so if you don't like that much fat then just don't put it in we're going to grind it all up it's going to be more than we need we'll let it go and if you want to make sure you get to the end of it you put a little piece of bread you put a little piece of bread in there and it pushes everything out let me show you how i make my patty okay i like to get myself a big ice cream scoop i'll clean it up later because i don't have any bread right now i didn't take it out but so what i do is i take a uh an ice cream scoop it's a big ice cream scoop and that gives me an exactly a five ounce uh hamburger you see five ounce right there i know i don't have to weigh them but if you don't have one of those just get yourself away i like to make them about five ounces some people think it's too big but you know to everybody everybody's got a way of doing it and then what i have i have a little ring that i use right there and i use that ring as my guide let me just clean this up i use that ring as my guide so i take a piece of parchment paper and that ring is the size that i'm gonna make my burger in so look i get it right there like this i put my big scoop in there i push it in i don't want to have to manipulate it anymore then you need to right you take it like this then i take this uh measuring cup right there and you take it now let me get a wash my hands a little bit and what we're going to do we're going to refrigerate it we're going to refrigerate it look i take it right there put on my plate and i'm going to refrigerate it for make sure it's nice and tight for a good half hour we're going to put it right in there and i already got into i already got one in there friends that has been refrigerated so i have it right there it's ready to go it's been in there for about 45 minutes half hour i got now clarified butter in there i'm going to saute it in clarified butter you don't want you don't have clarified butter use a a avocado oil use butter use olive oil it's not going to get that hot right we're going to take it right there and we're going to put it right in there friends we're going to put salt and pepper folding pepper and my oil is not quite hard enough but there you go we're going to get it hot really quick if i you watch we're going to cook it really really fast we're going to get a golden brown we're going to get some caramelization some malar reaction maya reaction my ah my alley is the caramelization of protein then creates all that flavor a lot of people do the hamburger on the grill nothing wrong with that you can do it exactly the same principle i don't have a grill so i'm doing it right here on the stove and i like better to cook on a stove and usually in the oven that's what i use but use whatever makes you happy what else that we're going to do with the bomb well i made a little mixture friends of dijon mustard and mayonnaise dijon mustard and mayonnaise is very simple the amounts it's really up to you uh if you're using a good spicy dijon mustard you do maybe a two two part mayonnaise for one part dijon mustard but put whatever you want oh get yourself a good garlic yoli a good garlic is delicious and i garlicka yoli is a garlic mayonnaise so that'll be actually perfect also in there you can use whatever makes you happy right and then we're gonna put some uh some lettuce in there and i got them cut already so they're not too big right and i use a um a butter lettuce i like a nice butter lettuce right and then we're gonna put a nice slice of tomatoes but i want it to be too big now i want it to be perfect i don't like it when it hangs around too much i like it when it stays the same size as the bun we're going to be elegant right and then we're going to put a slice of tomatoes we're not very lucky in uh in south florida without tomatoes i got to go to new new jersey to get some good tomato have you ever had a new jersey tomato amazing let's see let's see that thing over there it's doing good um uh what was i gonna say oh the next thing i'm gonna
