this week's take on fresh fish is fried cod battered and breaded homemade tartar sauce but what really separates it is the fish market where it comes from let's dive in [Music] fried fish fried coffe who doesn't love fried fish right and so I live in Louisville Kentucky and fried cod is one of the biggest things there is this is actually a lot of people don't know this the biggest fried cod market in the world is in Europe second-biggest the Ohio Valley so Cincinnati up towards Indianapolis Louisville you know we happen to be in all three markets but it is hugely popular mainly because of how many Catholics there are in the region and during Lent candy meat on Fridays and so they have fish fries and what do they normally fry is Cod but Cod is it's very very important there's all kinds of different Cod out there if you can find it you always want to get North Pacific cod this is way up Alaska you know during the in the Bering Sea stuff like that that's the best cod or North Atlantic cod like near Iceland you know one of those two areas those are the two best areas sometimes there'll be some from Asia and things like that you really want to avoid that if you can but one of the things you want to do you want to make sure that it's as fresh as you can possibly get it because sometimes they actually add chemicals and things like that to that so like we've talked about when you're talking at your fish market or you're talking to the fishmonger ask the questions and then you'll see but what we're gonna do today is a classical fried fried cod and here's the deal so a lot of people like battered fish a lot of people like breaded fish so to make that argument easier I like to do them both at the same time and what we're gonna fry in is peanut oil peanut oil has a high smoke point so you want to make sure you get the oil to about 360 degrees and the reason why you go to 360 is because when you put the cold fish in there it's gonna bring the temperature of the oil down so what you do is I cut that I had a big fillet of cod I cut it into individual sized pieces you want to dip it in the batter and you want to get that nicely coated and I use a batter called Weisenberger fish batter mix you can use whatever brand you like the best this one just happens my preference and then I like a cornmeal bread so you you dipped it in the batter and then you're gonna do what they call dredge it in the breading and you just want to make sure it absorbs all of that breading that it can [Music] where did that two more times now one of the other keys to some people like cocktail sauce with their fried fish some people that ketchup I'm a tartar sauce guy damn you like tartar sauce tartar sauce is super super simple to make and we're gonna make some here in a little bit don't buy it in a jar I mean if you have to you can but it's just so much better if you make it yourself and when I look at when I buy my fish I like to get it at a fish market or someone that has it really has a dedicated fishmonger or something like that just because they know more you know a lot of times with you bite at the grocery store whoever's working in that seafood counter they might be a brand new employee they don't that you might know more about fish that they do but not only that they may not sell as much fish as a dedicated fish market would so you're you're subject to get fish that's not quite as fresh as the rest so our oil is ready we're getting ready drop alright so we got the oil good and hot get your tongs okay I normally put them in by hand but I can't do it's too hot for that so while that's going I'm gonna go ahead and make the tartar sauce hello and by the way those sized pieces of fish which I'm gonna guess they're about 4 to 5 ounces each they take about three and a half to four minutes to cook so I'm on a time so here we've got looks like about three-quarters of a cup of mayonnaise my personal preference on the mayonnaise is Duke's some people like Hellmann's some people like Kraft some people like whatever store it is Duke's is just something that I learned way back to the restaurant business and that's what I like to use and then then what we're gonna do is just a few capers and it's okay if that juice from the capers gets in there it'll taste better and then we're gonna do a sweet pickle relish and what you're going to do with the sweet pickle relish is you're gonna start out with one heaping tablespoon and then go from there because you can always put more in you can't take it out and then what the kicker for me is the next three things and what that is it's just a few dashes of hot sauce [Music] some pepper and some salt and mix that up now I'm making it now while we're frying the fish but I'll tell you this if you mix this up a few hours before then it'll actually come out better because that the flavor will start to incorporate I'm actually add a little bit more relish [Music] and that starters off is ready alright it's been about four minutes or so fishes ready you want to be very very careful obviously because the oil is very hot actually first thing you do turn the fire off chop that off take the fish out let it drain for a little bit and then I like to let that just sit on a paper towel just for a minute or so it's plenty hot it'll stay plenty hot for sure [Music] [Music] so you've got a battered fish that's been breaded you got the best of both worlds there you have it fried cod one of my all-time favorites battered breaded some kettle fried potato chips homemade tartar sauce [Music]
