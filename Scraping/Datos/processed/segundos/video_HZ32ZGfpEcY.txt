well hello there friends fantastic video today take dinner on a budget stay tuned i'm going to show you how to do it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we're going to do it together right now [Applause] well hello there friends have you seen the price of beef lately holy moly you got to take a second mortgage on a house to eat two steaks you go to a restaurant it's at least 30 40 50 per person so i decided let's do a stick dinner on a budget okay i bought those two sticks right here two new york script okay it's not prime it's not the best quality there is but it's choice okay that's what you find in most stores today and um and they are uh nine to ten ounces so a twenty dollar pound these two sticks right there were eighteen fifty that's not bad okay that's a and then we're gonna saute some mushroom we're gonna do some potatoes it's gonna be a nice dinner where you're gonna get a dinner for two two steaks for 20 bucks or maybe a little more with a mushroom and a spinach and all that so it's not that much expensive i decided it's time to do something on the budget prices of food is ridiculous these days my goodness so friends i got the new york strip in here we're going to do them and clarify about it i'm going to wait a little bit because i want to do a couple of things in the meantime okay so we're going to saute some mushrooms and we're going to do the the potatoes i have a video already on the potato down it's right over there and and you can click on it you'll see it i'm just going to do them really quick so because the idea of this video is to show you that it can all be down a little bit olive oil you can all be down easily what do we need to do in advance okay a little bit of chopping and dicing chopping the mushroom chopping the spinach chopping the herbs i'm going to make a little herb butter the steaks would you you could certainly do it if you wanted to have a perfect steak friends perfect perfect perfect and you have time you can do it sold to 24 hours before and all that go check out that video we did about how to cook the perfect steak right over there there's the link and you'll see it's really cool okay um but so we're gonna let that and then a little bit here for the potatoes the potatoes the trick on my potato recipe friends the trick it's not really a trick okay it's to pre-cook the potato in advance all right so we're gonna do them a little bit of saute on you know let's put some extra on you all well you never have too many onion oil somebody say there's too much onion on your food you tell them to go somewhere else all right so we're going to saute them onions right there and a little bit of bell peppers but first we're going to wait for the onion to get some colors and the potatoes the only thing i did friends i pre-cooked them and when you check out the video you'll see how we do it correctly we do it with a little bit of vinegar water and if you look at them you can see a little bit of the extra starch and it's coming out when they start to be white like that they you can eat them right now okay but we're not going to eat them okay we're not going to eat them here because we're going to saute them first okay so now we're going to do the mushroom okay so mushroom we're gonna saute them in those shallots you don't have shallots use onion it's perfectly fine okay same family right here little um uh shallots and shallots are not like onion they don't require that much caramelization but they're doing a pretty good job at it right now little mushroom and the mushroom are going to take a while to get rid of the water friends so what we're going to do we're going to put some salt and that's going to help us draw some of the water from the mushroom hey you come back over here you did you see that that mushroom just jumped in the over there uh let me see yeah i'm good i'm good just want to make sure we're all good a little bit of black pepper right here on the mushroom we're going to get rid of all the water in the mushroom we're looking good with the onion here maybe a little more caramelization let's get going with the steaks so on the sticks friends i got i don't have the right temperature yet the only thing i'm really gonna do for those text folks i'm gonna put some black pepper in here can you hear a lot of people tell you don't put the black pepper you're gonna burn it where did i got that idea from i promise you friends that black pepper is not gonna build in five minutes in a frying pan i promise you i've been doing this for 50 years one of my favorite steak is the steak of huawei and i've been doing it like this for 15 years and i promise you that i don't like burned pepper and my pepper it never gets burned you put it in here like this okay okay now i gotta wash my hand i gotta at least get them a little cleaner let's see how we're doing here friends we're doing good we're doing good i want to get rid of all the water okay the onion could certainly caramelize a little more but they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna caramelize bell peppers chop small because we want them to cook at the same time let's make sure i'm not too hot what temperature do i have i want to be at about 350 365. we're using clarified buttercreams if you don't have but i don't use a good cooking oil okay whatever cooking oil you want to use like avocado oil it's perfect to do this when we are oh mamma mia i got to put more pepper in here how am i doing i'm doing good just checking cause i got three pain going you may want to take your time now put less pepper if you don't like too much pepper and salt is best friends if you put the salt in advance if you have the time but this is like a quick dinner we didn't have time to do it in advance so we're doing it right now okay and it's okay the perfect way to do it is to try to put the salt at least an hour before but this thin steaks that they're going to do fine we're going to put them in and we're not going to touch them we're going to leave them alone we're going to create a beautiful maya reaction let me clean my hands we're going to create a beautiful maya reaction caramelization of protein and that's really going to be some beautiful flavor mushrooms i'm going to reduce them a little bit yeah i'm going to reduce them a little bit they're losing all their water the potatoes remember they cooked already friends they part boiled okay you want to put them in there we're going to give them a nice flavor right there a little black pepper and then at the end we're going to put some parsley and butter butter we love butter did i put salt in there nope but here it is hello i know i already put salt over there okay while all this is doing i want to make a quick little butter we're going to put some spinach with the mushroom friends just a little spinach chopped spinach so it's basically a little mushroom spinach dill with um with a raw potatoes and a flavored butter really really simple to do right there you go how we doing here we want to get some color on a potato so let's get some good heat on there how we doing here remember don't touch it leave it alone create some beautiful maya reaction we're not there yet we're gonna make a beautiful butter my friends i gotta wash my hands again you know i got a thing i can't cook in a dirty kitchen and i cannot cook with dirty hands so i have to constantly clean things let me move this out of the way i have to constantly clean things i can't work with dirty hands you have a thing about this okay so now we're gonna make a little butter you can flavored butter you can make them like that i'm gonna make a video on all the different flavors you can do it like that or you can do it simply i'll show you we're gonna take a little spoon here friends let me see make sure everything's okay here yeah everything is good we're going to flavor this at the last minute how we doing here this stick let me check it let me check it i want a beautiful color we're getting there we're not quite there yet okay a little bit of fresh tago restart a little bit of fresh thyme a little bit of fresh garlic i mean a fresh parsley and yes a little bit of fresh garlic okay this is like an herb butter friends very simple to make you see look you can make this at the last minute just make sure your battery is at room temperature when you do these rinse butter has to be at room temperature if your butter is not at room temperature you're going to have a tough time mixing it right and then what we do at the last minute we're going to put it on top of the stack and we're going to let it mess it's going to be great okay let me see how we're doing here friends oh yes we're going to loop we're looking beautiful all right so now let me explain you something how we doing here we're doing good we're getting a little caramelization yeah we're going to do caramelization how are those guys doing those guys don't flip so good that's okay we're going to get them there you go there you go cooking that spinach a little bit all right so there's going to be a nice little side order i'm going to put a little garlic at the last minute potatoes are doing quite well they're starting to get a little caramelization the sticks so now friends this is too thick of a steak to cook we're going to pop them in the oven for a few minutes just a few minutes like maybe four five four five minutes depends how you like it cook my friends this um uh steak right here is about three quarter of an inch steak i can certainly do it in a fry pan but if i do it in a flat pan you know what's gonna happen it's gonna overcook the outside in order to cook the inside so i'm going to put it in the oven for a few minutes i got my oven at 450 500 put it as high as your oven can go 500 we're going to leave it in there it's going to get a beautiful crust remember i flipped the right so the bottom one is going to be really really flavorful it and that's why i flip i put it on top so now the bottom one is now cooking in the oven so you don't need to do both sides as much all right so let's check out those potatoes this potato looks different nice caramelization right there so they're almost ready we're gonna let them rest for a second this is done we're good the butter is done so here's what i'm gonna do friends i'm gonna put this in the fridge for a second because i want to be able to scoop it out with the ice cream scoop to put on the steak when the steak comes out i'm gonna let them rest for a few minutes and then we come back we're gonna finish the video together i'm going to put the whole dish together okay see look at the potatoes friends see we got nice caramelization right there and the last minute i'm going to put garlic and parsley on it at the last minute because i don't want to burn the garlic remember we don't put the garlic at the beginning it was a burn and if it burns it becomes bitter we don't like it mushrooms have been and the spinach will be perfectly fine at the side on the dish it'll be perfectly beautiful and we're going to also add a little bit of garlic because we've got garlic everywhere in here i hope you like garlic all right so we'll be back in a few minutes folks okay maybe three four minutes okay the steak is gonna need to rest when we take it out and then we'll put the bottle right on top of it all right so we'll be back in a few minutes okay friends depends how you like it cook you don't want to leave it in there too long okay get used to it remember don't be afraid friends to get a thermometer then you know how you like it cook if you like a rare medium rare 120 125 degrees if you like it more cooked than 130 135 140. however you like it there's no right or wrong here let's take it out of the oven oh yeah oh this fight bed is very hot let's take it out of the oven remember friends remember number one rule in a commercial kitchen and at home you take something out of the oven you leave a towel on it i don't care if you're by yourself leave a towel you think you're by yourself and then all of a sudden the kids come from home hey what are you cooking here dad oh mom and they grab the pan believe me i did that one time when i was in the restaurant business and uh it was so bad i'm still remembering it's probably 35 years ago where i grabbed the pan that was in the middle of the kitchen full of rice and a pan was so hot then when i grabbed it it stuck to my hand and when i went like this it took the skin with it so i promise you i never do that again in the commercial kitchen if somebody does that we kick him out because that is so dangerous okay so remember we take it out you do that so now what do we do we take these steaks put them on the side look how beautiful they look look how beautiful they look now if i was not doing my clear my butter right there i would pour this out and i would deglaze and make a reduction wine reduction or stock or something you can do a basic pen sauce and i have a lot of videos when i do that but this is not tonight it is not this afternoon this is not this video so we're not doing this all right so now the potatoes are done in fact i forgot the potatoes so they're a little more cooked than i want actually they're good some people are gonna like it and some are gonna say hey they're all too cooked a little bit of chopped parsley right there friends and they are some of them a little uh suntan but i think we're fine with it here you go put a little parsley in there they don't see it right you can also what i like to do at the last minute is put just a little bit of olive oil and we got ourselves some beautiful potatoes the spinach and i mean the spinach yeah the spinach the spinach and the mushrooms are done i'm going to put a little bit of garlic to it just a little bit of garlic i don't remember just the heat of the pan is enough to release the fragrance of the garlic okay very delicate remember so this is done the steak the steak now we got the butter what i like to do with the with the butter friends i take an ice cream scoop small one you see this i don't use that for ice cream ice cream i use the big one i got big ones to show you i got everything this is my ice cream scoop check it out yeah when i go here i want to scoop ice cream here so look you take it right there friends you take your butter right there you see i have an ice cream scoop yeah i got one and you leave it right there friends so while the steak is resting a lot of people think it's gonna get cold it's not gonna get cold friends this is gonna allow the juice to redistribute the mistake but i i highly recommend you go watch how to cook the perfect steak why i explained the whole thing okay and and i promise you you learn a lot but the steak doesn't get cold not not for the little time then it's the rest but the fact that you save so much juice of the meat by not cutting it right now if you're cutting right now i promise you you're going to lose a lot but if you let it rest you're not going to use as much okay 10 minutes i promise you it's not going to get cold so we're going to wait a little bit we have everything done the potatoes are done the mushrooms are done and the spinach are done we're going to wait and while it's waiting this um this butter right there what'd i do with a scoop of yogurt right there this scoop right there is gonna slowly melt on it look at it look at this shake this up you like this i love it yes you know i love a good sauce and don't get me wrong i love a good sauce but this right there too let me tell you my friends this is going to be amazing we got to let it rest let it rest so we don't use all the juices we're going to lose some but i hope we don't lose too much all right so when i come back we'll play then we'll cut into it okay so we're back in a few minutes let's give them it's been out what two three minutes maybe so we give another seven minutes all right it's not gonna be cold i promise you we'll be back okay friends well we are back and uh it looks like we lost a lot of juice but we haven't even cut into the meat it's not the juice right there we got a little bit of butter in there and probably the clarified butter from the pan because we haven't even cut into it yet so um what i'm gonna do is i'm going to what i want to make my plates and and we're going to put the spinach in here with a mushroom right in here i'm doing i'm putting it in a ring just because i like to make it look pretty but you know you just put it in the plate don't worry okay i'm just making one plate all right we'll put it on the plate right there and we leave it alone just like this it doesn't have to be perfectly flat but i like to make it look okay you see try to look here you go come back over here right so we got this and then we're going to put the the potatoes right there the potatoes and have a nice suntan but some of you love that i heard the comment i'm here to comment we love it when it's browned then you know what you're gonna be happy because those guys are nice and color brown nice nice color right with i like the drizzle just a little bit of my garlic olive oil on there just a little bit oh yeah yeah and then we can put a little bit of extra fresh black pepper just extra this is perfect i gotta learn to remove things out of the way right then we're going to take the steak uh where's my tongue oh i got a tongue right there there you go i'm going to take it right there i'm going to put on the plate right there my friends and now you can rub the butter all over the place you can put a nice piece of uh of taragong because remember targon is the herb yeah i can see so clarified butter right there the the herbs of the butter the main one is going to be flavorful is the targong so now all we're going to do is take this guy out so you see so it looks a little nicer right there and my friends we got ourselves a beautiful steak dinner that really did not cost us that much money i promise you you're going to a restaurant and you have this it's going to cost you 30 40 per person that's a meal is very expensive this day so let's cut into it okay friends let's cut into it because i know all of you want to see it so i have it right there and let's cut in and see what we got and right there it's beautiful rare that's the way i like it you want a more cooked remember this is 125 120 to 123. um you like it more good and that's cooker to 130 135 okay and this right there my friends is is amazing you see to me it's cooked perfect and as you notice you know we always have the critique and say well you got a lot of gray line you don't have much at all cooked in the oven like this you don't have that much as long as you paint it hot and look how beautiful this is my friend i'm going to take a smaller piece you know what i like to do i like to put it in the bottle oh mmm the flavor you know what's come out the most the tago is so powerful try to find fresh tacos if you can't find fresh tacos that's
