pan going over there we're going to put a little bit of uh olive oil you can't cook steak and butter remember now you see people cooking steak in butter your butter will burn before your um uh your your meat or your chicken or your fish whatever you're cooking is cooked because milk uh a butter has milk milk has protein and they burn at 250 degrees so you can't really cook anything about it you get most out of the butter if you put it at the end that's all we're going to do we're going to put in the sauce so i want to make sure that my pan is hot and i'm looking at 350 375 okay i'll make

friends is that beautiful or is that beautiful that friends is a perfectly fancy steak opuama peppercorn we're not going to take it and we're going to go to the oven all right we're going to go in the oven and and then we're going to make the pan sauce in the pan because i'll have some mala reaction in the bottom of the pan and have some fond in the bottom of the pan then i can deglaze with cognac while the steak are resting i'm going to make a pencil so everybody can do this kind of like what you need though kind of like what you need what kind of english is that you're going to need a little bit of a beef stock now this is a beef stock that we make of course because we have a commercial kitchen so it's easy for us to do it right but it's um if you don't have a commercial of course if you don't have a commercial kitchen not everybody got a commercial kitchen but what you do you make a beef broth or you buy a beef broth and you add some tomato paste to it and if you have some extra leeks carrot celery and onion put it in a pot with your tomato paste and you beef broth then you bought already right watch for sodium right and then cook it for a while and look look see how beautiful that is that's going to be super easy to make a beautiful sauce with it all right so the green beans they're already poached remember when you cook uh most vegetables green beans um broccoli you wanna blanch them first you can't take a green beans and saute in a pan right so you want to blend them first blanch means just sautee them a little bit in advance well now we're going to take some butter wait wait we're going to use the butter don't worry see look at that everybody's always asking me why do you have such a big thing about her right why do i have such a big thing about it it's a mental support so look friends green beans are sauteed already right all i'm gonna do now i mean they cooked already all i'm gonna do is i'm just saute them in butter really simple they already cooked right so what i'm doing now is i'm coating them with so i'm going to put some floral cell on top of it just use a good mediterranean sea salt if you don't have floral cell a little bit of black pepper but little because because the um the stick is going to have a lot of that in there already right we're just going to saute them nice and pretty they cook remember there's a butter you could you can add some shout outs to it i got some right here look we're gonna add a little bit of sugar so you can cook them a little bit right while the steak is in the oven we'll cook a little bit of shallots a little green beans right there delicious simple you know what i do is i uh when i do the green beans i cut the ends then it's attached to the to the plant and i keep this it's it's kind of cute right what do you think i like when i ask you what you think or you you tell me in um in the um in the comments hey don't forget to subscribe okay we need some subscriber we just relaunched this youtube channel and there's a lot of cool videos out there we taped a lot of video uh the last couple of weeks so we have a lot of them we're gonna try to come out at least with one a week we're gonna try okay it's a lot of work folks but uh we like it so look we got these uh beautiful green beans we're gonna leave them here for a second my green peppercorn i open up you buy them in a jar okay in a jar in a can green peppercorn that's the way they come like that and what i do is i drain them out of there because it comes in a brine and it's usually salt water you know that brine is just salt water and maybe some citric acid or something i'm not really sure what the hell they got yeah yeah look green peppercorn water salt and citric acid that's usually how they and then i drain that and then i put it in a type of wet container and i replace the water with cognac so so and then i keep it in my fridge i don't know if you've ever used it uh green peppercorn but the traditional in classical french cuisine we use it a lot in in dishes and that's the typical that's a classical second problem i'm going to show you it's really simple right it's really simple to make i'm gonna make it i have totally demystified the whole recipe to make it simple but this is gonna be a crucial ingredient for you okay what we're gonna do we're gonna deglaze the panda who's coming out of the oven in a minute while the steaks are resting and we're going to deglaze it with a cognac and then we're going to put a stock and we're going to put a little bit of cream just a touch of cream in there and then we're going to finish it up with butter yeah you got our butter butter oh baby no margarine you know margarine is the molecule away from acrylic you like plastic yeah you eat your margarine yeah yeah eat your margarine i'll eat my butter thank you very much okay what do you think the steaks are gonna be ready you know what we're gonna do we're gonna check them let's check them it's gonna be smoky in there you watch whoo i'll tell you what i'll tell you now be careful when you're taking the pan out of the fry out of the oven always keep a rag on it because you know it's hot right when you take it out but then you're going to do something and you're going to forget the pen there you're going to want to move it you know in a commercial kitchen it's a rule you take something out of the oven you leave the towel on okay so depends how you like you stay cooked this feels pretty good to me it feels about medium rare rare and that's the way i like mine so i'm gonna take them out okay and i'm gonna let them rest oh yeah look look at beautiful daddy you see if you could be here and smell them we got to let them rest it's very important it doesn't matter what recipe we're making we are letting them rest and now what i'm going to do friends i am going to get rid of the extra oil right there the extra oil and the fat you can keep it in there if you want i rather replace that fat with butter because it'll give me consistency will it bring me creaminess trust me i like better that way you do however you want to do it but this is a simple preparation for this is no big deal okay anybody can do this all right so now we're going to get the pen super hot that's not not that it's not hot already it's pretty hot right and then we're going to flambe it no no i'm not going to flambe
