hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm going to redo a video that I had uploaded a while back this is the fresh baked cod video after I had uploaded it I had to fix a few things and for some reason I cut out quite a bit of the audio it was very choppy and obviously you need to have good audio during a cooking tutorial because you need to know what's going on you're gonna be able to hear who's cooking so I want to review that for you guys a lot of people were asking questions about it and I just figured let me redo it I haven't cooked cod in a while anyway so that sounded really good but if you want to know how I do it then please keep watching I'm gonna show you step by step and it's not going to be a voiceover this time it's gonna be me actually cooking everything and you can see me doing it so you want to know how I do it then please keep watching if you watched my first tutorial on this video you'll notice that it really isn't that hard to make that is if you followed along without the directions of course but I just pulled out my fish from the refrigerator it came in one long fillet I got it from the seafood section at HEB and I am going to cut it in half so I have two nice sized fillets so this is what I have here this is just wild caught cod this is one filet it is probably about close to a pound I'm just gonna cut it in the middle I'm just gonna pick a good place right here and I'm just gonna cut it there we go and they're nice thick slices as you can see I'm going to preheat my oven to 400 degrees we're gonna bake the fish in the oven so I'm just gonna grab a pan and I'm gonna spread a little bit of butter in the bottom that way it doesn't stick so when we're ready to take and serve it on our plate it's not gonna fall apart so I'm just gonna take a little bit of butter just about this much you don't need much and I'm gonna put it in the pan my napkin and spread all around like that we're done with the pants I'm gonna set that aside now I grabbed a bowl like this you can use a regular size Bowl if you want we're gonna work on the the breading so what we're gonna use is some flour we're going to use salt pepper cayenne pepper and some paprika you can also add in garlic salt garlic powder if you want but I'm gonna use fresh garlic so I'm gonna get the garlic salt and powder all together so just once a couple tablespoons of flour just enough to coat the top side of the fish [Applause] next we're gonna add some pepper some crushed red pepper I said cayenne pepper but you can use crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper or whatever you want I'm just gonna use couple teaspoons of that then you're gonna go with your paprika about a teaspoon or so go and then we're just gonna mix it all together now that we're done with our flour mixture I'm going to dice it my garlic so I'm going to move my fish to the pan that we've already coated in butter or you can use a Pam spray or whatever you have just so you make sure it doesn't stick on the bottom set that aside and I'm going to use for right now one large clove of garlic this one is really big was probably equals 3/4 of a tablespoon so I'm going to dice this up nice and fine I didn't do this in the last video but I thought of it this time and I thought that would be a perfect thing to add to the recipe so I am going to zest about half to one lemon and I'm going to add that with the garlic and the butter mixture that I'll show you in a second it's just going to be more like a lemon crusted Cod which is going to be fantastic because lemon goes perfect with the fish so I have two lemons I'm just gonna start with one I'm going to roll it out so the juices get released a little bit and then I am going to use my zester I'm gonna zest that over my garlic and I'll show you what I do from there so please keep watching [Music] and I'm going to lightly butter the top of them so you don't need much and you just want to spread this on top like that actually the knife would be a lot easier so he's your knife I'm left-handed so I have to move the whole thing around a little bit and this is gonna help give it that nice flaky golden crust that's exactly what we're going for for this recipe in particular so just like that and the butter is also going to help the butter mixture adhere a little bit better we're gonna do is add the flour mixture on top of what we just added which was the butter the lemon zest and the garlic so you just want to spoon a little bit over the top like this I'm just gonna Pat it down a little bit like that so it's gonna look something like that my oven is now preheated to 400 degrees so I'm going to stick the fish in because it is almost an inch thick and I only have two fillets in there I'm going to cook it for about 12 to 15 minutes just keep an eye on it if you have a thicker cut of fish or if you have more fillets that you're cooking at one time just eyeball it you may need a few more minutes here and there but you'll know when it's ready is you're going to have that nice golden crust and the important thing is just to make sure it's cooked all the way through I'm gonna grab another cutting board because I am going to mince up my fresh thyme and parsley that I picked from my greenhouse those will be a perfect garnish for the top of it is gonna add a nice freshness to it and the child will also add a nice little bite along with the red pepper so I'm going to dice that up and I'm not going to put that on until I'm ready to eat [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] these are gonna be the lemon slices that I'll serve with it and I'm gonna use these end pieces as what I'm going to squeeze over the top of the fish when we're ready to eat while I'm waiting for the fish to bake I'm gonna get my sides ready I'm gonna do a little side of rice and some vegetables I really enjoy asparagus and Brussels sprouts with fish but I'm sure whatever we have will be just fine so I'm going to get those ready and I'm going to clean up and then when I'm finished it'll probably be time to pull the fish out of the oven and I'll show you how it looks okay so I just took it out of the oven it took about 20 minutes so a little longer than I expected but that's okay that there's a little bit of flour there it was just a little bit of extra I put on probably a little bit too much but it'll dust right off when you bite into it or when you cut it so it looks so good we have the golden crust like I wanted it's nice and opaque so I know it is cooked all the way through so I'm gonna plate it up and I will show you what it looks like and now I am going to squeeze my lemon on top like this I'm gonna add my garnish on top like that and then my lemon and that is what it looks like looks very good to me can't wait to eat it so as you can see the fish did get that nice golden-brown crust it took a little bit longer than I thought but that could have just been the thickness of the fish so I cooked it at 400 for about 20 minutes and I did a side of asparagus and rice and I also topped the fish with a little bit of the chives and parsley and I also squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top and then just put a couple of slices on the side in case you want a little bit more of the lemon juice so I can't wait to dig in I'm very hungry it is a little bit later than usual for dinner but I wanted to film this for you guys and getting it up so if you do try this out please let me know I'd love to see how you do it maybe if you put on Instagram tag me or something so I can see what you do so once again thank you so much for watching
