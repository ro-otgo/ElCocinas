hello again I'm John Tirzah and welcome to another video cooking lesson Susan cook today I'm going to answer the question in this lesson how to make one way of making chicken fingers or chicken tenders because I happen to be using chicken tenders in this I'm going to keep this concept and this lesson simple and you can improvise it in any way you want on your own but I'm going to use plain white unseasoned breadcrumbs chicken tenders a little salt and pepper and some all-purpose flour and some egg wash which is a combination of three whole extra-large eggs in about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of milk okay now one of the problems that people encounter when they're making any kind of fried chicken dish but in particularly fingers is that they're browned enough when they're being fried to be taken out of the fryer but the inside of them is not cooked yet so if you happen to have a larger piece of chicken that you're making fingers or tenders out of then just whack it a little bit like that to make sure that it's not too thick okay so I'm going to quick wax all of these a little bit cause I want to make sure they're all done perfectly and I don't have to over brown these where it's all said and done you of course can use strips of chicken breast meat or whatever it is you want to use from your to make this or you could use this same application and then method for chicken bites or pieces or nuggets if you will so there I'm going to make sure my chicken all gets cooked and I don't have to over brown to do it now if should happen that you do get stuck with chicken that's browned enough but not cooked inside you can always put it on a cookie sheet to finish baking it in the oven and slow that whole browning process down so I'm seasoning the chicken tenders on both sides with salt and pepper you know everybody loves this of course honey mustard barbecue sauce kind of thing this is what's not the light this is good it's another version of fried chicken okay now we're gonna flour all of these quickly now there's multiple versions of how this gets fried or battered or not battered these can be better in fritter batter they don't have to be breaded but in this case we're breading it they can be double breaded they can be single Brenda they can be egg washed and then floured and then egg wash and breadcrumbs but I'm gonna give you the real basic simple which is plain single dusting of flour shaken loose making sure you get egg all over it egg wash I have made more egg wash what I need because I'm making more after this video is made so let's lay some of these out on some of the plain breadcrumbs and let's put the breadcrumbs on top Pat them down a little bit see I made these kind of flat rectangular in the process of pounding them which makes them absolutely easy to bread because they're they have two sides now and if you want to use extra fine breading this is moderately fine breading that I'm using you could have chunkier breading you can use painful style breadcrumbs if you want now this one I ate it then I'm flowering it like I had suggested and then I'm going to put it back in the egg so you'll have you'll see two different coded versions from what Saul said and done and we will be able to tell the difference of which one is which this one was aged first before it was flowered let's get these and breaded again you can season the breadcrumbs too on top of just seasoning the you see how much more breading that has and the other ones there so this is a way of increasing the breading without necessarily making bigger breadcrumbs and this is our last two this whole videos being done at real time it does not take very much time and effort to make these this whole flour egg breading process that I'm doing here is very typical for a lot of different breaded things like fish and vegetables etc okay alright so let's get these gloves off and let's get these into the fryer I have this fryer set at 350 we're going to start out with the ones that were double dipped first and then we're going to put the single dip once in right behind that we want to make sure that they don't get stuck together so we're gonna fast forward right here for two or three minutes we'll see this is these are gonna be done probably in five minutes so I'll be right back we got about three minutes into them they look good I think they need a little bit more my suspicion is that there might be a little bit of paint left enough still so we'll give them a couple more minutes then about five minutes I think they're done we're going to find out when we cut into one of them so let's get this up cause it's a slippery slope coming up with chicken let's get them on this little child ray now you can tell that that was one of the double-dipped ones you can tell that this is one of the double-dipped ones you can tell that this is a single dip one that's a double dip one and those are that single and that's a single dip on there you see the difference in the clumping of the flower stuff all right so let's get these on well let's let's cut into one of these let's take this one here and cut into it first oh that looks perfect it's got the perfect profile of cooked chicken let's give them a little stack like logs on here and let's put some chopped green stuff whatever you want to put on here parsley chopped spinach chopped scallions whatever so there it is I have a little honey mustard on the side here because we're going to eat this right after the camera stops rolling but I hope I answered the question for you how to make basic chicken fingers or tenders for your special event
