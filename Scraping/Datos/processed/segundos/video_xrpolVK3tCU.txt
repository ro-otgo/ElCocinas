similar to this just the sauce and you can take on the barbecue this we're going to put it in the oven we're going to braise those short ribs with this amazing sauce that we're going to prepare remember the segment friends you have to if you want to cook with me first you watch the segment you see if you like it you want to cook with me you have to get all your mison plus and the best way to get it is let me get my towel first i got to clean my hands because i just touched the ribs um you gotta get uh you watch the recipe you like it good let's say you want to do it you go below the the video there's things a link it says see more you click on that you see it you download the recipe you have it printed and you do your mise en place it's a lot of stuff on this folks we got onion we got leek we got celery we got peppers we got garlic we got uh habanero but we got chipotle pepper and adobo sauce we got fresh herbs mustard tomatoes brown sugar vinegars mamma mia we got a lot of stuff this is not a quick quick quick thing to do but let me tell you this is going to be one of the best short rib you've ever had i promise you you're going to love it it's really really delicious bone in you want to do a bone out the one you can get like you can get some at costco they are bone boneless you can get those also they're wonderful i kind of like the bone in it's dramatic it's delicious and the bone gives you so much more flavor so first thing we're going to do is we're going to paint serum put in a flower get them beautiful golden brown and then we're going to make the we're going to make the braising container right here just checking the machine was hot enough i'm gonna start with a little bit of a garlic olive oil and then i'm gonna paint sear it the short ribs but i'm gonna do it with a clarified butter uh not regular about a clarified butter and in the essential we have a you guys gonna have to learn to make this now then our china channel is growing i want to teach you some new stuff and and clarify butter is a must to saute meat and all that so then you don't burn your butter and you don't burn your olive oil okay so it's much better to do we're going to make sure this is nice and hot we're going to paint serum and then right here all we're going to do is we're going to dust them with flour all the way around it you see and then we're going to get in beautiful golden brown and that's going to give us some really really wonderful caramelization right we're going to do that and then we're also going to get into the pot let me remove this get myself a moist rag and we're going to put them in here we're going to pen sear them and then we're going to make the sauce in here let me now wait further let me start making the braising liquid that's where the reefs are gonna cook we're gonna start with the onion remember onion is number first number one always and less what unless we got bacon if we got bacon we're using the bacon fat to saute the onion all right so then you put the bacon first let the fat render and then saute the onion but there's no bacon in here we certainly could have bacon in there but nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that you cannot oh mama mia don't get me started with bacon hey look it's not hot enough you see that this is number one ruler don't screw up in the kitchen leave it up to me i screw up okay so what you do when you do like that you just wait you wait i'm talking i'm talking and i didn't wait long enough so now i put the onion and nothing is happening that's because it was not hot enough you see i should have known you think i would know better after 50 years in the kitchen no something is wrong it's not cooking but we're going to wait for a few seconds [Music] well it looks like it's cooking now it's getting finely thank goodness took forever don't forget folks don't do it like i do i forget all the time things leave it up to me you know if i can make mistakes in the kitchen i make him i don't know about you but i make a lot of mistake in the kitchen he would think after 50 years i don't make any more no not me salt and pepper don't forget and now we're going to take those ribs friends and we're going to put them in and we're not going to touch them remember when you're cooking don't touch them leave them alone leave them alone don't touch it we're going to take this out of the way the onion are doing the thing this we're not going to touch i'm going to put almost salt and pepper in there and trust me that sauce gonna have a lot of salt and pepper in there i had put a bit of salt and pepper in the beginning in it and now i'm gonna put more so now let's go to this part right there let's see how we're doing with this you don't want to touch them unless it's really really starting to caramelize we want to make sure we caramelize the onions so they're nice and sweet okay that's really important friends we want to make sure those onions are nice and sweet and the only way they're going to be sweet and you know right now it happens to be the vidalia onion season the vidalia onion from georgia did i ever tell you i come from georgia no but i may have told you that but it's not true so but anyway have you ever heard of italian oh let me tell you there's a lot of sweet onion out there there's some from washington state that i wanted the guadalajara they're delicious also there's a lot of sweet onion right there but i have to tell you though i think uh vidalia are one of the best there's a lot of good one out there i don't want to offend anybody except our own or just the sweet all right fine you're on your own could be just the sweet i like the vidalia on you by the way talking about onion no don't touch it jump here don't touch it and i say that and i screwed it up see you don't want to touch it otherwise you lose that malar reaction you lose that carbidization and i don't want to lose it so um really really important if we don't have this so this friends basically here's what we're gonna do we're gonna braise embrace me submerged in liquid we're going to braise those amazing ribs in a barbecue sauce yeah we're going to braise them in a barbecue sauce you can serve with polenta you can serve them with uh we're going to serve them with a polenta cake today but you can serve it with mashed potatoes here serves whatever you want by the way you notice i'm not putting anything in there until they own your caramelized they're not so sweet right you're with me with this you're all with me right so that's why the onion always gone down first you see all of those wonderful cooks are there then put all of the stuff together all of the vegetables put together think about it celery leeks those are leeks by the way this is another onion you notice all of those people they put everything together at the same time you notice their onion never caramelized and if you think about it hey can we take a peek i don't want to burn them but it's not burning but it's not doing that great either let's see now we're gonna wait um where was i oh yeah i was with the onion so if you put your sea all the time you know the trinity the onion the celery and the carrots everybody puts all together and guess what what's in here what's in here 90 water imaging friends if you were to put a quarter cup of water in there you think your onion are ever gonna caramelize of course they're not gonna caramelize they're gonna stew and and then you're missing that opportunity because for all of you then cook there you know what i'm talking about right there this is nice and delicious deliciousness is that a world i think so so all right so look we're good right there we're gonna go in there hey you know i think these guys want to turn ah yeah they wanted to no kidding look at that you see how fast that went there you go that's what i'm talking about right there my friends let me just lower the heat a little bit because now it's on steroid all right so we're putting the celery in there all right then we're putting the leeks in there we're gonna put them in the same time yeah let's put the whole thing in there that's gonna be a lot of stuff in there boy let me tell you oh man it's gonna be delicious then we're gonna put some peppers let's put some peppers in there oh beautiful colored peppers whatever peppers you got don't be a dead hey cut them and oh by the way everything is not cut very small you notice that it's like medium dice because this thing is going to be in the oven for three hours friends three hours two and a half three hours right so if you cut it too small three hours later what do you got nothing right so look this is going to be really nice we're looking good friends i'm going to do it on all sides look how big they are they're going to do all side all side i'm doing it you see all sides and it's smoking i hope it's not putting too much smoke in here maybe we could do it to put it on the side over there i'll leave it here i'll leave it here we'll just pay attention to it all right so now let's make sure everything is going uh all right next ingredient here we got the aloe peanut peppers uh chipotle um jalapeno pepper you can put habanero pepper you can put whatever pepper you want you want to put a little heat in there okay now those peppers are not so hot so don't worry and it'll be everything will be in a recipe so you'll have it uh garlic you could chop the garlic but don't worry about chopping it because this is gonna cook two and a half three hours so you know this is gonna be nice and smooth it's going to be nice and roasted garlic flavor in it and put the whole thing in there it's only garlic right all right so here we go we cook it now what else do we put in here got a lot of stuff let me tell you a lot of stuff a little brown sugar just a little bit of brown sugar very little brown sugar all right then we're going to put some tomatoes in there friends we got beautiful beautiful chopped tomatoes it's italian tomato same tomato that i used to make my tomato sauce what else we got okay hold on let me make sure i don't burn nothing oh yeah it's looking good it's looking good you see we want to get on all side here friends see the color right there if you could be here smelling this he would say chef it smells delicious i agree um i got some uh oregano thyme and a little bit of rosemary just chopped fresh herb oh if i have time i'll show you how i keep my ears it's really important okay now this is really optional everything is optional really is chipotle pepper in adobo sauce i don't know if you've ever had that but that stuff is spicy man holy moly so the adobo sauce sometime is enough or you can put one of them now remember don't put too much too much light unless you're cooking for a church this is like holy moly that's enough right there you see that was almost nothing right did i put your brown sugar in there you already i think i did all right then we're going to put a little bit of maple balsamic vinegar if you have a if you don't have a maple balsamic vinegar then put a good balsamic vinegar in it just a little bit of it okay just a little bit my vinegar is sweet so it's going to go really really well in there let me tell you that sauce is going to be amazing and then we're going to put a little bit of beef stock let me turn these guys off because they're done and and then at the last minute we're gonna put some of that this is a a a maple flavored bourbon whiskey this is good we're gonna put at the end we don't need to put it now we don't need to put it now friends because if we put it now uh it's gonna all the alcohol is gonna cook up now some of you say always ask me he said well we if we can't have alcohol what do we do don't worry just don't put it in you can't have it it's okay you're not gonna miss it if you can't have it right a little bit of worcestershire sauce worcestershire sauce however you say it and believe it or not i'm gonna put a little bit of dry mustard i know i don't use it for very many things of course i don't use it from anything it's closed it's still closed you see so i'm gonna need a knife oh boy to open it up don't tell anybody but i have knife that i use just for this i gotta cut the paper that's all i'm doing with it i'm not opening a can i'm just cutting the paper because i can see already the knife police are there going oh my god he used the knife to do it but hopefully macaroni just a little bit friends just a little bit dry mustard i actually don't really use dry mustard for many things but in a barbecue flavor it just it's it does a little magic to it i think it's delicious so here we go we're done with this we're going to take them we're going to put them in there just like this bone side down to begin with and that's okay we can flip them later that's it let me take this out of the way put it right here so it's out of the way let me move this i can leave the pot here it's doing quite well here and now we're going to put stock we got beef stock in there folks and we're going to put the stock on it just like this now remember brazing that means then it's submerging submerging that's a new culinary term we're learning today we are submerging the ribs so they're gonna cook in the stock so depends on how big of a pot you have depends how many ribs you have you're gonna it's gonna determine how much stock you're putting in you see if you don't have a oh look at this look good or what oh yeah it looks great um uh let me let me just reduce this for a minute depends how much you have how big of your pot you have how big of your pot you have i think instead of my english improving it's getting worse it depends how big your body is will determine how much stock you need so have some on hand and you're going to say wow this is beautiful i know you're going to say that if you don't you should look look look look look look how beautiful that is is that gorgeous or what this is the stock that i um i made it's under it's on a website it's center essential because that's an essential thing the chicken stock the beef stock you got to make this you can put in the freezer and last you 17 years in the freezer approximately okay so um a little more salt and pepper now remember my stock friends my stock has no salt and pepper because i don't put salt and pepper in my stock you shouldn't have salt and pepper in a stock because a stock is something you use in the dish do you put the salt and pepper in the dish you don't put the store and pepper in there the reason why when you buy a store bought is full of sodium four five six hundred seven hundred milligrams of sodium per cup sometime is because they use the salt as a preservative when you make it at home you put in a freezer that's your preservative don't keep it no cooler you keep it in a refrigerator a week maybe maybe i won't even cook more than five days in a freezer 17 years like i live a year or two what else do we do with this now friend we take it we put a cover on it we got an oven at 375. i'm gonna take him and i'm gonna go and put him in the oven that's all i'm gonna do open up the dough pull pull the shelf take it over right there put it in the middle of the oven you see friends right there and forget about it forget about it for three hours not really you don't forget about it here's what you do you put it in there every half hour i want you to go in check it make sure it's all okay in there put the cover back on go in there another half an hour check and make sure it's okay flip them on the other side go back in the oven do it for two two and a half three hour however long it takes for the meat to start falling apart and when it does you're good to go at that point you may thicken the sauce a little bit you may um i'll give you some tips in the meantime we're going to close it for now we're going to cook it for two and a half three hours we're gonna do a thing we're gonna finish putting the bourbon at the end like i said you don't put alcohol in yours don't worry just don't put it in oh another thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna put a liquid smoke it gives you a nice little smoky flavor and you know this is a natural product it's made with ickery smoke really liquidy smoke and water this is this is natural product and i promise you it gives it just a little smoky test to it it's really really delicious and yeah and make extra because the sauce you're going to get out of there is amazing so you want to make it a barbecue we're going to make a video just on a barbecue sauce also if you don't want to make the short ribs okay so we're going to put it in the oven or we're going to put it we already put in the oven and we'll come back in two and a half three hours so go do something but remember to check them and then when we're ready to serve it i'm going to show you how to play them okay friends 2 hours and 45 minutes those guys have got to be ready let's check them out oh it's hot it's hot yes it's very hot friends oh yeah super super hot [Music] let's look at it and then let's determine a few things now a lot of people like the fat in it and if you want to leave it on there it's your fat you do whatever makes you happy i like to remove it so what i do is i take a ladle because uh you know they were lit they look beautiful but they were a lot of fat in there so what i do is i put my later on in there and i just push it down slowly and you remove a lot of the fat most of the fat if you notice inside that bowl i don't know if you can see inside that bowl but there is a little bit of stock right there the rest of it is all fat so you can do it at the same position same position you got to just push it down and if you notice just don't push too fast if you do too fast then you'll get all the sauce to go in there because what you have in there folks you have the barbecue sauce now some of you have watched my barbecue video and you you have your own barbecue sauce and you can serve them you can make it with whatever you want but this right there is the braising liquid that can turn into a beautiful barbecue sauce so you see look it's getting less and less and less right you notice and all this right there is all fat so i think we got most of it you see let me go over here now and see if i can get a little bit more on that side but i don't think so see i got most of it right there now some people said oh i like to eat that what then you go ahead it's your fats you eat it you do whatever makes you happy with it but i highly recommend you don't all right so now what do we do with this you can refrigerate it uh and and and and just throw it away don't throw it whatever you do friends with this you cannot throw this in the garbage if you throw i mean if you control this in the sink it's like a cholesterol for your plumbing i highly recommend your you throw it in the garbage congeal it will put in a refrigerator and when it's cold just throw it away in a garbage all right so now let's look at our ribs i'm gonna temporarily put them on a plate right now i'm gonna look at them the bones just came out you see the bone just came out all right see the bones right here see right there that's the bone right here we're going to take the bone and we're going to do the same thing and we did right here we're going to take it off and you're going to see why in a minute now i'm pretty sure this is a safe bone to give to your pet but last time i said that i got a lot of bad comments do not give the bone to your pet okay so then don't give it to them so i'm just going to take them out i'm going to size them up and now let's take the bone out now at this point friend you can very well just take this whole thing right there take another bone here we only have three yeah okay that's good i only have three bones now at this point folks this right there is delicious there's nothing wrong with this but the french training in me says jean-pierre you cannot serve this like this you got to make it look prettier so here's what i like to do like i do with my barbecue sauce i take that whole thing right there and i'm gonna strain it you see now i'm gonna get all the flavor out of it you see i'm gonna get all the flavor out of this imagine that now all the vegetables is now going to puree oh you know what i forgot to do i always forget to do that but that's why i got it here so i don't forget put it already quit smoking there you don't want to put the liquid smoke don't put it in and like i do on my backpack on my barbecue sauce i got this beautiful maple favorite flavored bourbon whiskey okay put a little bit in there not too much right like a mama box juicer like for my barbecue sauce and we're going to puree this puree puree puree puree until we have a very smooth okay look very important friend we want it to be very very very smooth okay very very smooth that's what we're looking for see very smooth you're gonna see well it's not very smooth i agree not yet but everything is so hot you could never eat it anyway now so all that stuff right here right now everything is going well okay how do we make this look pretty i'm going to show you in a minute friends i'll show you in a minute if you've seen my uh barbecue sauce recipe you already know what i'm going to do but now let me just test this to make sure it's good now nismo salt you know it's good time to do it now more salt yeah more pepper a little more whiskey and maybe you could use just a little bit more oop there you go more or less all right so now we're going to mix all this up and like the barbecue sauce we're going to strain it you don't have to strain it if you don't want to trust me it's going to be delicious straining or not straining it i promise you it's still going to be delicious it's just going to look better if you strain it that's all right let me test it again let me test it again friends let me test it again now it's good now it's good friends remember when you're looking for salt you want to find the salt you look for a salt you look for it and if you can't find it then keep testing yeah you will find it all right so now here we go friends let me take another pot it's a good thing to have all those spots in here put that right there but this little big right and now we're gonna take that ladle that we used and we're going to take this [Music] again like i say you don't have to do this you can skip it i'm just going to do a little bit okay because i can't do the whole thing otherwise you guys are going to think i'm taking too long i just wanted to show you that's all i want to show you how to do it and like i said if you watch the barbecue sauce recipe you know exactly what i'm doing all right we strain this look at this look at this i did it in a barbecue sauce so i'm not gonna waste too much of your time watch the barbecue sauce recipe you'll see what i'm talking about but look at the difference between this and this this and this you see granulated looking smoother silk looking then we're going to do like we do with a barbecue sauce like we do at the barbecue sauce put a little spoon in there just put a raw butter in there yeah just put a little butter in there the butter is going to give it a smooth filling uh yeah it's going to make it shiny it's going to give it an exciting shine to it let me tell you friends this is going to make the ribs amazing you see make sure you melt it all right there i could have taken a whisk that would have been more professional ah you can rub that sauce all over your body no no okay how do we gonna serve this we're gonna serve that a long time ago and i'm sure a lot of you would have been very happy but you know sometime i complicate the issue i got my oh well i don't know if you've seen it but i made a video on how to make a goat cheese polenta and in the video i show how to make uh how to make it into a polenta cake so i got it in the oven i made some polenta cake and what i'm gonna do now i'm gonna take one of those polenta cake and i'm going to put it underneath the rib that's the exciting part let's find one that is uh then it's behaving that it's not too crooked this guy's fine see right here this guy's perfect right there right so we're going to take this we're going to take a polenta cake then we think it's going to fit make sure this is clean make sure this is clean and we're going to go in take a polenta cake put it right there this could be mashed potatoes this could be whatever makes you happy and then we're going to take that short ribs right there friends i'm gonna put right on top of it just like this just like this and then and only then oh i messed up the plate we're gonna take a spoon and we're going to be very very gentle with the sauce we're going to put just a little bit of the sauce on top you can put a lot of the sauce if you want it's really up to you friends but i'm going to put just a little bit of the sauce you put as much i got to clean this up or as little of the sauce as you want we're going to put a little bit of this we're going to get like a parsley leaves somewhere i got i had a couple of them here earlier right there and this friends is something you can do at home this is easy this is not difficult to do at home right there you can do it this way you can serve it with noodles you can serve with papadela pasta you can serve it with rice you can save with polenta you can serve with a soft polenta in a bowl however you serve it i promise you this short ribs is gonna be amazing right there absolutely gorgeous wow i almost forget the favorite part of the day i gotta test this thing i'll show you but it looks like it oh baby look at this look at this friends look at this look at this oh man look at this this is going to be so amazing probably going to be very hot so i got to be careful oh wow oh baby the sweetness of the barbecue sauce that thing melts in your mouth you know this rook i put it in look at this i put it in and it literally literally melts in my mouth literally
