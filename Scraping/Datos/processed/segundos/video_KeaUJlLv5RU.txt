and doesn't that look nice and the aroma in this house is absolutely amazing okay I'll carefully lift it out of the pan and onto a plate and loosely cover it with a little foil and let it rest and I'll show you how I make this outstanding gravy and just looking at that little piece of meat there you can see how tender and moist it is okay now on to the gravy first I'll remove the larger bits of rosemary and onions with a slotted spoon they've done their job I've squeezed the juices buck into the pandal [Music] [Music] now Lum meat juices contains a lot of fat and it needs to be removed so I pour it into a clear jug while it's still hot and that way the fat will settle if the top and all you've got to do then is simply skim it off with a ladle as shown and that's a good shot where you can see there's about an inch of fat floating on the top of these meat juices and it really has to come off [Music] [Music] if you discarding this fat don't be tempted to pour it down the sink or you'll end up clogging the drains what I do is either use it for roasting potatoes Yorkshire puddings etc or let it solidify in the fridge and get it into the normal trash bin once all the fatties off add an extra 200 mils of water or white wine I'm just using water and strain it into the pan on a medium heat once again squeeze out all of the liquid it's too good to waste now bring that to a simmer and add the one ounce of 30 grams of butter the butter will give the gravy a wonderful glossy appearance to slightly thicken the gravy add a couple of teaspoons of corn flour you may know that less corn starch to a little cold water and mix them together if you know how to make a simple root thickener using equal amounts of butter and plain flour by all means do that but I'm keeping it simple now pour it in a little at a time until you reach the required thickness that you like and that's the required thickness that I like and that's it the gravy's done so I'll get the lid on and turn off the heat right it's been resting for about 20 minutes so I'll carve a couple of slices off and not a little of that gravy and give it a taste how better gets a thumbs up [Music] and just by the way it's carving you can see it's tender moist and it looks so appetizing okay I think that's enough mate now for a little of that gravy all you would need to add to this would be some steamed carrots and broccoli mashed potato yokes are put in and some homemade mint sauce on the side oh yes absolutely gorgeous you can taste all those ingredients in that gravy the rosemary the onions the time all combined with that beautiful meat it really is an incredible combination told you as the thumb and once again please consider supporting my patreon appeal for as little as two dollars per month or if you prefer you can make a one-off small donation using my paypal page it really does go a long way towards ingredients and production costs as every penny pledged goes back into my videos and whether you've donated or not thanks again for your wonderful support in watching the channel well thank you again for watching please like share comment and subscribe by hitting the circle above if you do subscribe activate the bell icon next to the subscribe button on my channel page and by doing that you'll be automatically notified every time I upload a new video and in the meantime here's a few of my other videos and playlists that you may wonder watch so until the next time be safe in the kitchen and bye for now
