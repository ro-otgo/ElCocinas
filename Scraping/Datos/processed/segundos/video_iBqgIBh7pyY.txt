hello again I'm John Theurer sack and welcome to another video cooking lesson from the seasoned cook today I will answer the question of how I make a stuffed roast pork loin stuffed with sausage the ingredients that we're going to use are all right here it's a trimmed clean end of a boneless pork loin some fresh rosemary some blanched Italian sausage I have here garlic and a combination of dried tarragon oregano thyme and basil which is going to use for some of the herbs and we're going to put a little olive oil on this and salt and pepper okay so we're going to start out by cutting ourselves a hole for this sausage in the pork loin I'm going to take a knife a small knife initially and make sure that we stay in the middle then we're going to take a bigger knife and push it through notice how it's came out the other side twist that knife around a little bit now I'm going to take one of the sausages I want to cut this off because I want this end to be flat so when I put another sausage into it they come together so we're going to put a little bit of oil inside this hole that we cut and we'll put a little bit of oil on this sausage and we will stuff the sausage all the way through to the other side you see there it is now we'll cut this sausage flat again so it goes up against this one and they are flushed together in there next step is going to be quickly tying this up now why do you want to tie it up you want to tie it up because you want the entire piece of meat to be snug wild it's roasting we're going to cut ourselves a big piece of string here and we're gonna so I'm going to start by showing you the classic way to tie a rose and then I'm going to show you the quick way to tie a roast at the same time so initially the classic what we would call the professional way to tie a roast would be to initially wrapping this around three times so it stays initially find yourself a good slip knot now then bringing this under bringing all this string through doing it again now I'm going to make this roast for you and ultimately it's going to end up with a lot of garnishes like sweet and sour cabbage and roasted apple lining up all of these knots here as they do this now the other way which is the way I would normally do it with a roast like this is I'd make the first tight thing and then I just simply take the thing and wrap it up look hopefully without get my string all knotted up and then tying the first piece of string together at the end of the other piece I'm going to cook this roast slowly as if we were cooking a prime rib or something along those lines let's start by putting the roast in a bowl let's get some of our rosemary picked off of here we got some fresh rosemary for this which is perfect this is going to take at least two hours of slow roasting because I want it a pink and a little bit just a bug paint when it's all said and done and I'm gonna chop that rosemary that's enough now I'm gonna take some olive oil put it all over this roast so that stuff pepper salt acceptor stick to it so I'm gonna get very generous with the pepper and the salt and not all the herbs on the outside of this because you remember you're only seasoning the perimeter of the roast the entire inside it's really not seasoned there's some salt now we're going to put some more oil herbs they could call this an herb roasted pork loin if you wanted to it looks good as you can see okay a little more oil and the rosemary and garlic a lot of garlic well I wouldn't consider this to be a lot of garlic I would consider this to be the perfect amount of garlic okay now I'm going to take a roasting rack I'm a little pan put focus on there take the balance or whatever I got here now let me rinse my hand off for a second and now I'm going to put this in the oven and we're gonna fast-forward this video for a couple of hours until I think this is done I'll tell you exactly how long it was in the oven and then we'll take it out let it rest and relax for 15-20 minutes then we'll get it on a platter for you with a whole bunch of different garnishes all right I'll see you in a couple of hours I can't wait to eat this one this only looks really good already okay the roast stuffed pork has been cooking for about an hour and 10 minutes it's medium rare and I'm gonna take it out of the oven and the reason I know that it's medium rare is by the way it feels it's a little bit soft here you see the internal temperature of course is not what it would be for me to wear because the sausage is in the middle of this if you wanted to test this with a thermometer then I would say you want it to be a hundred 1518 degrees something like that so we're going to let this cool off completely then we're going to take the string trim trim off any jagged edges on this before we wrap it in the pastry and bake it off so I'll see you in a couple of hours you could also put it in the fridge overnight and cool it and wrap it up the next day if you want and then bake it okay so I'll see you when it's cold we'll finish it off okay this roast has been relaxing for about two hours I'm gonna get the string off of it now and we're gonna get it sliced up and get it onto a platter with a few little few little other things that I made to go with this roast all of which are just options which I have some roasted rosemary potatoes and half roast hat half onions roasted with thyme and some fresh roasted apples and I have some rosemary white wine veloute sauce also so there's a lot of rosemary going on with this particular dish make sure you get all the string off too by the way otherwise some of you'll find it end up with some string in their mouth somewhere along the line which has certainly happened to me if you do enough of these roasts sooner or later you're gonna miss a piece of string yeah get camouflaged in there all the cooking juices etc I think we got them all we got the Apple you got it all let's slice the roast and see what we got on the inside here for starters let's go right there oh yeah look at the temperature on that roast that is a perfect medium pink which is what I recommend for this particular dish you know so let's get some of this sliced up and we'll get it on our family size style platter here this looks absolutely awesome I think you would agree with that so you see how easy it was to get the pork sausage in there it's not no big spectacular skilled task you just oiled up the sausage a little bit and stuffed it in the hole oh that looks really good that looks like it's cooked like perfect I hate to be the first one to say that but what can I tell you so let's put some other stuff with it let's put the let's put some of the roasted rosemary potatoes with it let's get a little of that juice on there all that butter parsley garlic on there you have a video for that that I made for you let's put a little bit of roasted apple on this talk about getting all delicious looking this looks absolutely sensational to me let's cut back on that one let's go with those two and then let's put some of those oven roasted time flavored onions that are whole here also these are these are so delicious this whole dish with this kind of garnishing is a way of taking this kind of preparation over the top and finally let's get a little bit of that sweet-and-sour saveloy cabbage on this platter yeah we got some real food going on here this has got holiday presentation also written all over it let's get this moved up here now and let's get us a little bit of sauce on here so we have the rosemary white wine bootay sauce which I made a lesson for you for we don't want to cover up that sausage when we put our sauce on it or the beautiful color of that meat so we want to kind of put the sauce around it a little bit in some ways maybe even a little bit on some of the other foods here you know that Apple could use some of this oh yeah oh my god this looks really really good let's look sprinkle a little bit of parsley on here just for fun and let's squirt a little olive oil on it just for fun so I hope I've answered the question for you of how to stuff a pork loin with sausage and roast it and in fact going beyond that we've got it onto a plate with a whole bunch of really good stuff for you so please enjoy this one
