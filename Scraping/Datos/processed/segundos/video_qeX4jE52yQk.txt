foreign [Music] hope you all are doing well in today's video I will be sharing a recipe for Chinese style fried chicken I already have two recipes on my channel but I figured I'd do it again and address all the questions I had in the first video you know people was asking a lot of questions and you know in this video I'll address all of that now what I did was brine the chicken first this part is very important because if you skip this step your chicken will be Bland basically so I brined the chicken first but I didn't get to show it apart because I decided on the last minute to actually share the recipe again so I brine it in sugar salt and water I will leave all the correct measurements and ingredients in the description box then the next day what I did was rinse the chicken really well and now we'll proceed to The Next Step so for the ingredients I have here some soy sauce I have some housing sauce I'll be using some star anise I have garlic ginger green onions or scallions I'll be using some Chinese five spice some chicken powder or chicken bouillon and some white pepper you can use black pepper if you like so to a large pot I did add about 10 cups of water and will go in with the soy sauce now it will look like a lot of soy sauce but it's really not for you know to give that chicken the flavor you need a lot of soy sauce so we will add all the ingredients here and we will mix well and we'll allow it to come up to a boil or a simmer before we add the chicken next you want to add the chicken and you want to allow it to parboil for about 20 minutes once the chicken is nicely parboiled we'll wait until the water starts to actually boil before you start counting the time down okay and once your chicken is parboiled for 20 minutes it will float up to the top that's how you know that it's time to remove the chicken once it floats up like that we'll remove it and we'll place it on a wire rack to drain you do not want to fry your chicken when it's wet so allow it to drain off and then before you actually place it into the oil to fry it you will Pat it dry with a paper towel so one of the questions I got was can we use the broth that the chicken was boiling in and yes you can reuse the broth what I did was added it to a small saucepan and then add some corn starch to thicken it and it can be used as a dipping sauce for the chicken once you add the corn starch in there and it thickens you turn your heat off and set aside now if it seems a bit too salty before you add the cornstarch you want to add a little bit of water to dilute it and yeah it can be used now we will proceed to Frying the chicken we will fry it in oil and we will be using the airfryer because another question I got was can we use the airfryer for the chicken and the answer is yes you can use airfryer so now we will add two of the leg quarters to the airfryer and I have it preheated to 375 we'll cook it for about 12 minutes and this is how it looks once it's golden brown the skin is nice and crispy you can remove it and place it on the wire rack to drain before we cut into it and see what it looks like and remember that the cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken so bear that in mind now this is the chicken once it is all done the one on your left is the air fried chicken and the one on your right is the chicken that was fried in actual oil now they tastes exactly the same once I cut into it the only difference I will say is the air fried chicken the skin was a bit more crispy than the other one but it was absolutely delicious it was juicy tender moist and flavorful and I did serve it up with some vegetable chow mein and sweet and sour shrimp it was delicious my entire family enjoyed it and I hope you all give this recipe a try if you enjoyed the video don't forget to give it a thumbs up share it and leave a comment down below I will leave all the ingredients that I use down in my description box and I'll see you all next time thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and enjoy [Music]
