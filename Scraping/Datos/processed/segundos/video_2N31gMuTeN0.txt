and ring that bell stay tuned friends we're doing it right now together [Applause] well hello there friends salisbury steak today that's delicious we're going to make it's color oh you probably had it before it's a hamburger steak so it's a hamburger that may look like a steak or meatloaf steak or tv dinner call it whatever you want to call i'm going to make my own right there my friends i got get the gloves on uh i'm just more comfortable working with the gloves when it touches the meat then i don't have to wash my hand for 10 minutes so uh 80 20. you need a little fat so 80 20 ground chuck uh i do it but you know you can buy from butcher shop that night so we're gonna make it together okay it's very simple friends i got some bacon going over there i'm gonna i'm do it very slowly yeah it's so slowly it's not even moving uh and it's just i do it when i saute the bacon like this friend i do it very slowly because i wanna i want the fat i wanna use the bacon fat so we're going to saute the salsa berry steak uh in in the bacon fat and then we're going to use the bacon to make the sauce we're going to make a nice sauce mushroom sauce with it all right so friends i got the the meat right there we're going to put an egg then we're going to put a little bit of garlic i'm going to save some for the sauce the ground garlic chopped garlic freshly chopped garlic we're going to put a little bit of a mixture i have mixture of thyme and rosemary and then i'm also going to put some chopped parsley and then i'm going to put some finely chopped parsley you can just do one it'll be perfectly fine then we're going to put a little bit of worcestershire sauce that's going to give us quite a bit of salt we're going to put a little bit of um hot sauce don't want to use hot sauce don't worry about them and i like to use a little bit of buttermilk this can you know it's very similar to the recipe i make friends for my meatloaf if you've never had my meatloaf oh you're gonna try it out right over there jack's gonna put a link in there for you meatloaf is amazing it really is then we're going to use some fresh breadcrumb you can use dry breadcrumb but i don't like it you know so i use freshwater how do you make fresh breadcrumb right over there there's a link i use it for the tomato pie i use it for the meatloaf i use it for so many the recipe for i put on top of fish i put this boycott on top of fish you can eat this by itself it's so it's so good you're going to put things in there it's got to be good don't forget anything it's possible you can also put your cayenne pepper you can also put a little bit of dry mixture of the provence if you haven't if you don't have it all about a dry mixer but probably have some oregano thyme rosemary in there basil mix all this up friends you see mix all it up you don't want to mix it up more than you have to but why would you want to do that anyway you know you hear people oh don't mix it up too much you're going to make it tough oh we're not going to mix it anymore than we have to it's kind of fun actually i forgot to put salt in there i know i gotta put it uh uh uh worcestershire sauce but that's not gonna be enough so here we go i can't go in there in the salt right now so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take the gloves out oh boy takes the gloves out i take the gloves out i'm gonna put the salt and then i'm also going to put some pepper and i'm going to use my coarse pepper because i like it that way and now i'll tell you what real quick i put another glove on it'll be quicker to put the glove on than to try to do it with the uh with the spatula you see and then we're gonna make the steak all right and i got a easy method to make him i'm to show you i feel like i'm making making dough i need another glove hold on hold on yeah it takes two seconds you watch not exactly that'll teach me to forget something i'm always forgetting something you notice that i always forget something all right we're going to make them now all right so now i got a mess over here that's okay i'm still going to clean my hands so look thanks what i do is i take a cookie mold cookie cutter cookie cutter mold right and i put it in there this i i already know because i've been using it so you have to calculate it this is gonna give me a um a six ounce steak six ounce by the way i didn't tell you that but i got two 24 ounces one and a half pound of of ground chuck okay so i can make six four six ounces that's exactly what i'm doing so you see what i like to do i like to just bang it make sure it's nice and tight okay make sure it's nice and tight that's very important right and then we remove it right and then it's not a hamburger right it's a steak so when we take it we make it look like a steak so you push it but you see it's nicely together okay all right my friends so i'm gonna do this three more times right there maybe a little bigger yeah three more time uh and then i'm gonna put them in a cooler i'm gonna let them chill a little bit because they it's easier to handle them if we let them chill a little bit and then when we come back i'm going to remove the bacon and we're going to saute them and then we're going to put them on a cookie sheet we're going to tell them cool a little bit it's easier you could do it right away but trust me it's easier if you just take your time you chill them and uh and then we're gonna continue we do the whole thing so we'll be back in a couple of minutes i'm gonna continue making them okay friends so the the uh the fat bacon fat you see that we're gonna saute the steak in there it's hot i wonder about um i'm looking at at least three hundred three and a quarter see the sticks are holding together i call them steaks it's really a hamburger hamburger stick yeah and uh and we're gonna sear them get a beautiful color that's all we need to do and then friends we're gonna transfer them we're gonna still use the same band we're going to transfer them let me clean my hands we're going to transfer them in the oven for a few minutes so you got to make sure you got your oven on it so i got my oven on at 400 and a quarter so i like it to go really quick and um as soon as they golden brown we're going to flip them and i'm going to put them in a cookie sheet i like to cook them on this silicone mats you know the silicone mat i love those i've been using them for years years like ever since they came out 30 years ago i don't know when and they're great because nothing sticks to it silicone you wash it good the secret though with those friends if you got one of those you gotta put down soap dong dong dong dong whatever you call it uh palm olive not substitute not so good i like dom butter don't soak and uh and and you you wash it you let them hair dry let's see what do we got here i want a beautiful color let me see what i got it's starting it's not exactly what i want so but this is uh let's see yeah yeah it's starting to look good you see they're starting to look good friends so what we're going to do we could certainly um smells good we could certainly uh put them in the fry pan like that in the oven but i want to use the fry pan and all that goodies all that bacon powder and everything i want to use that i may have a little too much fat actually i'm going to remove some of it making beautiful golden brown and then we're going to put them on on the cookie sheets and then we're going to come back and make the sauce okay so voila voila and they're not going to be in there very long but you could certainly cook them in the sauce but you know i made them pretty thick i think they're more they get a better result if you uh cook them so i'm gonna pop them in the oven i got the oven going and then you see who it's hot in there and then i'm gonna get rid of some of that fat i got a little ball in here i just got a little too much i don't need all that i mean you know what i'm not gonna throw it away i'm not gonna throw that fat away because that fat is gonna be delicious for anything making omelettes saute anything right i mean anything friends now we're going to start testimonial remember the onion is always number first number one all right always always always always saute the onion make it look beautiful golden brown and then what else are we going to put in here what what else that we're going to put in here let me take this out of there let me get myself a uh a plate so i can put my thing i got we're going to make a sauce now you know remember friends i know a lot of you make you you make your your steak the way you want i i do the same i make it the way i want and it might not be what you think it should be but that's cool make it the way you want it you know i'm sharing my recipe with you you know i find it interesting when people are watching the channel they go well that's not the way i do it's like when i did the uh the shepherd spa mamma mia how many people oh that's not a shepherd spice my space my shepherd spy you're watching my channel i make it the way i like it you don't like the way i like it make your own channel yeah having a channel some people have great ideas start your own channel look youtube is a great place to share your idea for instance your idea all right look the ono is starting good we're going to give him another minute or so what else am i going to put in there i got the bacon i'm going to put in i'm going to put some more garlic i'm going to put some more fresh herbs you know what i'm going to put also it's a worcestershire sauce i got it right there i put it away earlier but i'm going to put some of that worcestershire sauce and i'm going to put some wine you don't have to if you don't like the wine a lot of people don't drink wine so uh if they don't drink wine there's nothing wrong with that just start a little more beef stock that's all you don't need to replace wine you don't drink it just put stock i mean you gotta replace it with the liquid but you don't need to you know this is how you replace it you just don't put it in and you put extra stock okay the onions are good now we're gonna put the mushroom and what do we do with the mushroom we gotta get rid of the water and what's gonna help us get rid of the water salt and i was thinking this recipe will be happy with the mushroom salt or the roasted garlic salt or the mushroom sauce roasted garlic sauce i think it'll be perfect in here you see a bit of salt in there and we're going to cook we're going to wait a minute so we're going to take a little break folks we're going to come back this is gonna take about four or five minutes so i'm gonna take a quick little break we'll come back when the mushrooms have lost all of their water okay friends look at the mushrooms they lost all of their water you see they lost all of their water so now we're going to finish the other ingredient we're going to put the bacon we're going to put a fresh thyme and then we're going to put our garlic you see put the garlic in there and a minute the second not the minute you see here ain't gonna be no minute the second we smell the garlic that means it's releasing its fragrance we're gonna put the wine another reason why friends i like to use a madeira or a masala or a pork is because they fortified wine and they don't need to be reduced some people say well why don't you reduce it so i answered the question a couple of times and i'm going to continue a little bit until the questions stop coming but think about something when you're cooking why are you reducing wine what are you reducing you're reducing it to make it softer to make it sweeter to make it not as bite because when you bring a regular wine like a chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon to boil you test it it's terrible you want to get rid of the alcohol this guy right there is already sweet you don't need to reduce it to make it nice and slow and soft and and smooth it's a fortified one so here we go so that's why i like to do you don't want to put that wine don't worry about it just put the put a red wine and just let it reduce that's all right we're going to put a little bit of um worcestershire sauce in the sauce and then we're going to put i'm going to take the steaks out friends i'll take them out let them rest a little bit i call it a steak right and then we're gonna put a little bit of beef beef broth i have my brief broth right there friends and of course at that point you make as much or as little sauce as you wish it's really up to you at this point friends so now you see the sauce is a little thick a little thin so we want to thicken it so for those of you that have followed my video on how to thicken anything where we make that roux you'll be happy to see that i'm reusing it because i really want you guys to start doing this this is really a cool trick remember we did this on a video how to thicken everything video right there if you haven't seen it this is a great way to do it this is a cooked roux if i were to use a regular roux i would have to put it at the beginning so it cooks the flour on well this has cooked already it was in the oven all night so this is a cook roux and this is a brown roux so i'm going to put very little of it just to thicken so it's to the right consistency and you see the fact that it's already cooked it doesn't it doesn't need to uh uh to wait for it to thicken your watch it's gonna stick in right away so if you don't have any cook root and most people don't have it you follow the video and you try to do it because you can keep at a room temperature right here on your counter it'll last a few months from there don't worry about it it's full it's clarify butter so that's why you scrape fry butter so it doesn't go bad and you can leave it in your counter without having to worry about it so maybe just a little bit more what do you think friends what do you think just a little bit more and what that does that adds a little bit of butter also and then i'm gonna add more you see so right there friends you have yourself an amazing sauce then we're going to test make sure it's good because uh what how can it be good i didn't put any butter yet so i am going to uh to test it it's gonna be hot need salt more salt yeah and more butter turn the heat off and more butter oh yeah yeah don't be afraid okay now you don't have to put the butter but i do now remember when you put the batter friends you turn the heat off and you want to mix it right away and look how beautiful that is so i love freshly freshly chopped parsley at the last minutes because i love the fresh fragrance of freshly topped chopped parsley and uh and right there my friends you have yourself a beautiful mushroom sauce that you can make with a steak you can you don't have to make it with a salisbury steak you can make with any steak you want and look how beautiful that is my friend now i'm going to test it again to make sure it's good and make sure it's good look at this you see look at this one well i can't take it so big of a spoon because it's delicious i just got a nice piece of bacon in there okay i'm gonna make a platter now this i like to serve family style not make a friend fancy you can serve with mashed potatoes you can certainly do some spinach you can do some green beans you can do a bunch of stuff with it then put the sauce on top you can put the sauce on the side and uh you know i don't have a clean plate can i get a clean plate guys right there i'm going to uh to put a little bit of sauce right there you see i'm gonna put a beautiful sauce right in there see right in my platter and uh of course if you serve it with vegetables you can make a fancy plate as well it's really up to you my friends so okay we're just going to do this really quick and we're going to put them right in there you see beautiful mm-hmm that's gorgeous and of course i'm gonna try one in a minute and then what i do i take my freshly chopped opacity and i put it right on top just like this and of course i would put a couple of parsley leaf to decorate the platter but this is it just right there and then also we're gonna have a plate and i'm gonna test one now this is gonna be delicious yeah simple and then friends you can certainly do also what i love to do a lot of sauce and then we're going to take a fork because we don't really need a knife and we're going to go in and just cut it right into it and this my friends it's going to be delicious now cook it however you want it i don't like it rare like i like a steak it's different it's like a hamburger i like a medium oh mama mia mmm i love it love it love it you guys are going to love this i hope you
