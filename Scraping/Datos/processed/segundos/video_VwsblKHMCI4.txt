hello again I'm chef Jon turns axe and this lesson to make roast rack of lamb parcel odd what does parcel odd mean it means a mixture of breadcrumbs garlic parsley and a little bit of butter or oil that you apply to different foods so I have an 8 bone lamb rack here and we're going to clean most of this off because we're gonna put some Dijon mustard on here and a breadcrumb mixture that we're about to make then we're gonna bake it over this mirepoix that I have sauteed with some rosemary thyme bay leaf and it has some garlic in it ready to mix in but it won't you put a little white wine on here the reason we're doing all this is we're going to make a traditional sauce out of whatever's in this pan after this roasting process is complete which is a systematic approach to salvaging any drippings in from any roast and applying it to the juice of the sauce that you're making that's what we're going to do this has some fundamental qualities to it making this dish okay so let's get this lamb rack trimmed a little bit here what does excess fat right here off keep cutting right along with it I take this off I have this belief that the least amount of fat that you serve with this kind of dish the better now can I leave the fat in between the bones I can or I could take the fat off the bones like so this is what I'm going to do is I want my bones nice and clean when we ultimately carve this this is two dinners this is an Eightball rack so it's pork chops per person here okay uh-huh okay take a little bit of extra fat off these bones this way all right now this amount of fat I'm concerned with too I don't want to have the person who's eating this half the battle between what's good and what's not good in each bite that they're cutting into so I'm going to take all of this excess fat off of here and I'd say that's just about enough off right now there's little portions like that that's okay okay so here's what I'm going to do I have two cups of plain bread crumbs here and I'm going to put about Oh a cup of chopped parsley in here I'm going to put a couple tablespoons of chopped garlic in here let's say three tablespoons of chopped garlic and I have some melted butter here now I'm gonna make let's get a little salt and pepper in here before I even continue a little bit of pepper and a little bit of salt there now we're going to add whole melted unsalted butter to this mixture until it's at the texture that we want in other words it needs to be like if you're from the north good packing snowballs because we're going to pack it onto the lamb racquet it needs to be able to adhere to the lamb rack first let's get it mixed up a little bit see it's starting to get a little pasty that's exactly what I want now you can make roast pork loin carsalot which I have done a lot by applying this to a pork loin that's a lot less expensive it's still equally as tasty let's put the rest of this butter right here I think in this case we had about a cup of melted butter okay that works for me we'll see how that texture is here it's I can let's just give that a taste for fun is it good nice and garlicky but not too garlicky okay let's sink this mixture that we have here and add a little bit of white wine to this band not much just enough to moisturize it during the roasting process at this point later we're going to be adding warm white and getting all the residue off of this after the roasting process is done okay so now let's look a little bit of salt and pepper on the rack now I remember this could be a pork loin or any other piece of meat you want to do this treatment to really now put some Jean mustard directly on this lamb rack like so it looks like a lot of mustard but it's not and it's going to help the breadcrumbs stick to it perfectly which is what we're going to put on here right now this parts a lot mixture by the way you can keep it your fridge and kind of use it for over a period of a couple of months if you want and just temper it and the defrost cycle to get back to the good packing state that this is now and I think we have enough on there we want to overload it because in the final analysis when we're slicing the lamb rack when it's all done if this is over packed with the partial odd mixture that it's going to have a tendency to fall off more when you're slicing it so we're going to put this in a hundred and seventy-five to 225 degree of it we want to cook this extremely slow so that the eye of the lamb rack is all one medium-rare temperature overdone so let's get this in the oven this is going to take probably a solid hour if not more at that temperature now I could cook it at 300 but I would call that speeding cooking it in a faster way that I need to the slower you can cook this if you think about it in terms of a miniature prime rib or something like that the better off you're going to be so we'll be back in about 45 minutes to check out it okay that rack of lamb has been in there at 200 degrees for two hours taking it out right now I've been pushing it with my fingers and saying okay this is done that's how I've been testing it so let's let's pick this rack up set it on this plate I didn't add any moisture to this smear pot throughout any of the cooking but it has whatever came out of that lamb is sitting in here now we're going to put this on stove and I'm going to throw some white wine out here so we could to glaze this this is up we're going to make a simple white wine Demi brown sauce ain't going to take too much of the glaze that about the glaze already okay so now let's light this up and we're going to make the sauce understand the first thing we're going to do is we're going to reduce this line this procedure that I am showing you right now is a very old-world standard principle in salvaging any flavors that are left over from any roasting process where the food is either put on a rack or not put on a bracket we're always systematically getting that flavor left it incorporating it into the final saucer juice so we let this reduce for about five minutes they're going to add some dummy to it then we're going to reduce that a little bit then we're going to strain it it sees it that sauce is going to be done so I'm gonna fast forward about five minutes from now be right back okay about five minutes worth of reducing here is what we've got as you can see about 75% of the white wines I'm not going to put a cup cup and a half of brown sauce demi-glace whatever you want you to put brown juice in here if you want to serve this with a nice juice we put this back on the stove bring that up to a simmer or going too fast over you through this for another three to five minutes then we're going to strain that sauce cut the lamb put it on a plate will be that simple so I'll be back in now a couple minutes okay the brown dummy and the white wine with the mirepoix it's cooked enough for me I'm going to strain it this lamb is still hot so the connection between making the sauce out of the residual from the roasting pan in terms of the amount of time if it's consistent with serving the land that having it's still very hot now I'm having to reheat or anything but now this is a little juicy and I'm okay with that doesn't have to be sauced assistant it's kind of like a cross between juice and sauce let's give it a taste this tastes good this needs a little bit of pepper it needs a little bit of salt and in this case I think this needs a small pinch of sugar also just that rosemary sometimes has that just is do I'm not making this sauce sweet by the way something that Rosemary's little there's a strong fight to and that's a way of kind of mellowing that out taste that nice okay let's put the sauce on the plate I have enough exactly here for a couple of orders have enough for one more order here we're going to put one on the plate here so let's cut the lamb and see how it looks so it's four bones fur this actually has seven bones but part of this lamb rack right here is missing this bone right here so I'm gonna cut this in half carefully because I want to keep the bread crumbs on the lamb rack how does that look oh boy that looks really good let's let's cut this carefully because we want to keep the bread crumbs intact here or the parcel I would set that down right there like that look at that probably should be using my French knife for this but I like this roast knife a lot push my French like that run into a little piece of bone there obvious and APSCo perfectly you see the way it's all one temperature that's because we cooked it slowly you could say that that's one dinner right there but if this was me eating this I would want this other at least one of these small pieces from this end here extends of that there you go there it's a nice rack of lamb dinner this is basic now - this is the an old traditional version but when I say basic I mean mirepoix underneath the roasting rack little bit of seasoning on the top looks good and how to salvage the juice from the roasting pan and get your sauce made I've and it's very very traditional way of going about so there you go roast rack of lamb parse a lot parse a lot being the crust that's on the top you get a chance to eat this which I'm about to do go for it thanks for watching
