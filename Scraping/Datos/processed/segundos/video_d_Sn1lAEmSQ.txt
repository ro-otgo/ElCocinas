[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel i hope you all are having a fantastic day and someone had requested chinese fried chicken and today's your lucky day we are going to be fixing chinese fried chicken here i have four leg quarters that i washed and prepped i have some soy sauce i have ginger garlic green onions star anise i have some chinese cooking wine and some chinese five spice i also have some white pepper and some sugar let's get started so guys the first thing we'll do is brine the chicken we will do that by adding some sugar and some salt to this chicken and we will let this sit for four to six hours if you can let this sit overnight that will be best you will get the best results if you let this sit in your refrigerator overnight but i don't have the time today so i am allowing it to sit for about four to six hours i'll go and um run a few errands uh cook some fried rice and then i'll get back to the chicken so we let this soak in the sugar and salt all of the ingredients and measurements will be listed down in my description box we let this soak and i'll be back with you guys next we'll add all of our ingredients to this pot with water i have added three cups of water to the pot and now i will add my soy sauce my sugar you know all of the ingredients like i said before everything will be listed in my description box we'll add them here and we will let this boil for about 10 minutes we want all those flavors to just absorb into the water and just be a nice broth for our chicken to parboil in so after about 10 minutes our water should be ready now and what we'll do is add our chicken in here we'll add it in and we will allow the chicken to boil in this water for about 15 to 20 minutes and what we'll do is every five minutes we will baste the chicken with the liquid we'll go in with our spoon and we'll base it you know just to make sure that the um chicken is being really good and submerged in that liquid and we'll let it go for about 15 to 20 minutes and then i'll show you guys the next step after about 20 minutes we will now remove the chicken from the liquid we'll turn our heat off and we'll simply remove the chicken but you have to be very gentle because we don't want to damage the chicken skin okay we want the chicken skin there you know because it's just better to fry the chicken with the skin it's nice and crispy it's also better for presentation purposes so we don't want to damage the skin be very gentle and remove the chicken so here i place my chicken on a draining rack because you want the chicken to drain off and dry a little bit before we start frying it you don't want to place the chicken straight out of the water into the oil it's very very dangerous so we let it drain next we'll go ahead and fry our chicken we will deep fry it in enough oil that the chicken can be submerged in there we'll fry the chicken for about 10 to 15 minutes or at least until you see your chicken starts to look golden brown at this point it should be thoroughly cooked because we parboil the chicken first so once your chicken starts to look golden brown you will remove the chicken from the oil and proceed with frying the rest of the chicken you can allow your chicken to get as brown or as light as you like it is your choice so now we'll continue the same process until we are all done and once you're all done guys this is how your chicken should be looking nice yummy and delicious now i'll plate this up and i'll show you guys the finished product okay guys so this is my take on a delicious chinese fried chicken whoever asked for the recipe i hope it met all of your expectations if you follow the steps you should end up with something amazing it's crispy on the outside soft moist and juicy on the inside i will be pairing mine up with some fried rice but you can have yours with whatever you like i do hope you guys enjoy the video if you did give it a thumbs up share it leave a comment down below and don't forget guys hit the subscribe button for me i will be leaving all my ingredients and measurements down in the description box and i'll see you guys in my next video enjoy [Music] you
