today I'm going to be showing you an all-time favorite dish this is one that's been a favor to my family for decades and it's a funny dish because virtually everybody makes it does it slightly differently I know my mum did it a certain way my father does it a certain way my sisters do it in totally different ways and this is my little tweak to version of this dish it's absolutely delicious dead simple to put together and guaranteed your family going to yum it up it's being strong enough on the one pot chef beef stroganoff is an incredibly simple dish it's so delicious it's so fantastic it's great for just an everyday dish or for special occasions so it's really easy because you just need a few basic ingredients today we're using some lovely lean beef I cheated I didn't chop it up myself I just bought some what they call stir-fried beef from the supermarket as you can see it's very thin beef little strips that's perfect for beef stroganoff because we don't want big chunks because they take forever to cook when they're big chunks so nice thin pieces there and we go to season these in some seasoned flour now you see me do this before snap my bag got 1 cup of flour in there I've seasoned it with some freshly cracked black pepper and some sea salt and I've tossed in some mixed dried herbs as well so all we're going to do is put this in there yeah we just seal them up and give a message so we go all of the beef is looking lovely coated in that flour mixture you can probably see there's a fair amount of flour and there don't worry because we won't be a little bit of extra flour in there because that's what helps to thicken the lovely stroganoff sauce so we will set that aside we're going to start with our veggies in a saucepan we have a little bit of olive oil which is just nicely heating up we're going to throw in one onion which I've just roughly chopped up pop that in give that a swirl around we're also going to pop in some button mushrooms which I've just sliced up I'm not going to give you an exact measurement only because the amount of mushrooms you want to put in is based on personal taste I've put in about 8 mushrooms which I've just chopped up just toss that in give them a stir around and lower them to cook for about 2 to 3 minutes until the onions have started soften up and the mushrooms have started to cook that's cooking nicely now we're going to add our next ingredient which is some tomato paste I'm putting in two of these little tubs it's about 300 grams in total now tomato paste there's different names depending where you are in the world you might call thick tomato puree or something else altogether it's basically just condensed pureed Tomatoes lovely stuff adds a lot of flavor that's one in we're just going to mix that through now I know some people when they make beef stroganoff they don't add tomato paste they had other ingredients but this is the way that I've been doing it for decades and it comes up absolutely astonishing so give it a go if you've never tried this way before that's looking very nice now we're going to add in our seasoned beef the beef covered in the flour mixture so we're just going to toss that entire things straight in oops yes time said many times it wouldn't be a one pot chef video if it wasn't a mess we're just going to quickly stir that around a bit and so become very it mess like sort of almost dough like sort of with meat chunks in that's okay now we're going to add in two cups of beef stock a little bit at a time so we're just going to pour a small amount in give it a stir until it's mixed in completely now the idea behind putting in a bit at a time is that if you put it in all at once it won't mix in properly it will just become a big mess we put it in a bit at a time it will slowly integrate into the flour and tomato mixture and will become this lovely thick sauce I've just finished adding the stock and I also added two cups of just cold water just plain old tap water order and we've got this lovely thick casserole happening here absolutely amazing so all we need to do now is turn down the heat to probably about medium or low on the serve top and we're going to put the lid on and we're going to let that simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the cook until the beef is cooked and is lovely in tender stroganoff is City cooking and I've just added in some sour cream no specific amounts at all down to personal taste but I put in a good couple of generous spoonfuls into it as you can see it's turned into this lovely thick creamy casserole which is just absolutely divine and smells even better this is truly amazing all right time to serve up and here's our finished result our delicious beef stroganoff I've serving it on a bed of white rice and I cannot wait I've got to just try a little piece right now lovely bit of beef bit of sauce Oh YUM beef is beautiful and tender sauce has got that lovely creamy tomato flavor to it onions and mushroom flavor it's absolutely amazing mmm now this is what I call a great meal so I hope you've enjoyed this recipe all of the ingredients are in the description below and check out my other videos at
