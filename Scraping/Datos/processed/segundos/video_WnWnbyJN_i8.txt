okay guys so here we have our chicken so we're going to do step one and us basically to clean the chicken you're going to be mixing in this bowl after you place your chicken in there you're gonna add your salt so we're gonna put some salt in here about two tablespoons of salt maybe three that should be enough we're going to add a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar say about two tablespoons should do add this border and you're basically gonna just allow the chicken to soak in the salt water or vinegar solution for an hour 30 minutes should do the job afterwards what we want to do is we want to rinse this off and then we're going to season the chicken so what you're going to go and do is you're going to rinse the chicken off rinse off all of that salt water vinegar solution so now it's time to season this chicken it's time to season the chicken we're going to season it with some seasoning so make sure you add a nice amount of this we're going to now add our adobo season to this like I said most people only use one or the other not many people use both but doable season and season the salt but I like to use both next we have some onion powder we're going to use a nice amount of that well it's chicken without pepper folks everybody seizes that chicken with pepper mix it in first we allowed us to sit for 8 to 12 hours and it's gonna soak up all of these good juicy seasons look at that and this is going to give you a chicken much more flavor so you're gonna add about 2 to 3 big tablespoons of butter to a pan let that melt and what you're gonna do you're gonna get your apple cider vinegar you're gonna add just a couple tablespoons of that I'll say about two tablespoons not much you don't have to cook this too long just want to steam it a little bit just like that to melt the butter we're gonna pour this over our baked chicken and just going to help the skin Brown and get that nice golden brown crispy skin topping that you you want your chicken 1/2 so that's all you're gonna do you want to use about three tablespoons of butter and about two tablespoons of vinegar and that's it more butter than vinegar just remember that you know the chicken that we seasoned last night and we're going to place that in the baking pan always cook my chicken on that side first then I turn it over on the skin side hmm and as I say in my other videos when I get done marinating much my food with my meats just look at how well seasoned the chicken is has a orange look to it that's not you can tell that your chicken been marinating for 1218 hours yeah we got two drumsticks two dots and five wins okay so we're going to do now is we're gonna get bad vinegar butter mixture that we mixed together and we're going to pour that into the pan what I like to do is when I'm baking my chicken I like I mean should I covered the tip of the wings so try to do that try to cover the tip of the wings because those are the pieces that kind of stick up once the oven get hot and they may burn a little bit nothing like burnt sits on my chicken so that's a cover if you can like righty I'm going to cover this try to cover the tips of the wings I'm gonna put this wing under here put this one under there and then cover this one with the thigh like that and then put this tip under here and make sure this tip is covered with this by this die and drumstick because you don't want chances it's a fine and that's what what happened if you don't cover okay so I'll show you guys how it would look after it's all done and it's nice and crispy and brown I'm gonna show you how the best the
