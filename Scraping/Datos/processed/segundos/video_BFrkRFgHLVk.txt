[Music] hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with lasagna that's right i'm finally making lasagna it's been requested so many times and because it's such a popular italian-american holiday tradition i thought this would be the perfect time to do it so for me there are two keys to a great lasagna a fantastic meat sauce and a great cheese filling so first things first so for the meat sauce i'm gonna take some italian sausage and ground beef we're gonna put that over medium heat and while it's browning we're going to break it up into as small a pieces as possible while that's browning i'm going to take some mushrooms and give them a really rough chop okay don't worry about them all being the same size those are going to break down in the sauce anyway so i'm going to add those to my brownie meat all right go ahead and stir those in i'm also gonna add some salt some black pepper and some red chili flakes okay so at this point i want you to turn the heat to medium high and cook it until the meat's browned and any liquid that came out of the mushrooms has evaporated so you see this the meets brown in the bottom of the pan is pretty much dry and at that point we're going to add our prepared marinara sauce am i using homemade well i'm not at liberty to say but you can use just about anything here homemade jarred sauce as long as it's good quality not a problem right you saw me had a splash of water there if you're using jarred sauce make sure you rinse the jars with water and then we're going to bring that to a simmer turn it down to low and simmer for hours how long exactly i don't know it should simmer until the meat is extremely extremely tender alright i did mine about two hours you want to make sure you add a little more water along the way if it's getting too thick and once it's done and you're happy with the texture turn it off taste for salt and pepper and set it aside alright so that's half the battle our beautiful meat sauce is ready on to the cheese filling which is simply a couple beaten eggs some ricotta cheese and not that skim milk stuff the real whole milk variety for this recipe you just need the highest quality cheeses possible will people know i don't care i will know and you will know so after that we're going to add our reggiano parmesan and fresh mozzarella now you notice how it's diced and not grated you shouldn't be able to grate good soft fresh mozzarella in fact there's no saying if you can use a grater you should be a hater all right so use that nice fresh soft mozzarella they have it in stores now use it we're also going to add some salt and pepper and cayenne and then last but not least some fresh italian parsley and give that a good mix so like i said earlier if you have a great meat sauce and a really great cheese filling you are going to have a fantastic lasagna there's no way not to so before we can assemble this of course we have to boil one box one pound lasagna noodles all right make sure you're using salted water now this is the only time ever except for maybe pasta salad where i'm going to tell you when the pasta is cooked drain it rinse it and keep it in cold water alright so you see that here my noodles are ready and it's time for final assembly and yes in case you're wondering i have tried using the raw noodles not boiling them first i don't like that method all right let's talk about the pan this is not something that goes in your wimpy little 9x13 casserole dish this needs a lasagna pan 10 by 15 by like three inches deep is perfect all right so get yourself a nice lasagna pan now assembly is super easy if you can do some simple math divide your sauce into four parts your noodles into three parts and your cheese into two parts so one fourth of the sauce goes down on top of that one third of the noodles all right i had 18 noodles so i use six okay so once the first third of the noodles are down the base of our lasagna is done and we're ready for the first half of the cheese mixture right so divide that perfectly in half spread that cheese mixture out onto the noodles and then top with another portion of the meat sauce all right so once that's spread nice and even we are going to take the second third of our noodles place those over and as long as it's covered you're good don't worry about what it looks like don't worry if you got a couple broken ones it's all good when it bakes so the second layer of noodles are down the last of the cheese mixture gets spread on there i don't know about you but i'm getting kind of excited on top of the cheese just like our last layer goes the meat sauce at this point we're going to give it a little shake to settle it and yes the old tapatapa and to finish this beauty off the last of the noodles go over the top you can see the end there i just pieced together some of the smaller broken pieces doesn't matter relax once this cooks it all looks fantastic all right over that goes the last fourth of the meat sauce spread that over make sure all the noodles are covered i'm gonna dot that with more fresh mozzarella we're gonna finish with some more grated parmesan cheese cover it loosely with foil i don't want the foil touching the cheese but i do want it covered i'm going to put it on a sheet pan in case i have any spillover i'm going to put that in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes at that point take off the foil continue cooking for about another 30 35 minutes until it's done and when it's done it will be golden brown it will be bubbling and it will be hot all the way through what a gorgeous gorgeous lasagna if i do say so myself and i know you can't wait to tear into this but let it sit for at least 20 minutes it's just gonna be too hot to enjoy unless you do all right but after that all bets are off cut it into nice squares you'll get like 12 decent portions out of this or like nine huge ones you can see all those beautiful layers that super meaty sauce with the sausage and the beef and the mushrooms adding a little bit of extra something the beautiful cheeses so so delicious so whether you're serving this for your italian american christmas dinner or just any time i hope you give this recipe a try so go to the site all the ingredients are there for the sauce for the filling for the whole thing and as always enjoy [Music] you
