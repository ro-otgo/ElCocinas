had chef down at the salt room in Brighton today when we cook in a wild sea bass with local scallops wild asparagus artichokes naki and a chicken veloute we're here at the salt room we're going to be prepping a amazing Latin quart sea bass now this fish has been scaled and trimmed up so I'm just going to show you how to break it down into finish first of all I'm just gonna quickly talk you through what to look for when buying a fish of this nature make sure you check the eyes you know they should be nice shiny not though or sunken good indication that the fish is fresh also is that the gills as you can see there they're nice and red and and you know it's smell is very important it really shouldn't smell of fish so first of all I want to run my knife down the back of the fish just to release the filling to make sure you've got a nice shot flexible knife for this and just follow the bones down to the ribcage we'll make a incision pound side of the head right the way through to the belly and just prise it open so let the knife do the way just follow it all the way around keeping as close to the barn as possible you don't want to lose any of that amazing flesh let's follow the ribcage around welcome across some pin bones but we'll take them out later there's one Phillip removed got pin buns running down here and some of the bones off the belly still but will requite take them out in a second then you just left with frame of the fish which will be used for stock or fish soup or something else they just using the whole animal right so we're left with to fill it to the sea bass we'll just check if there's any belly bones connected still we'll just run our knife down there trim them off discard that bit let next technique is called pin bonding so basically it's just a using a pair of fish tweezers to run your hands fingers down the middle of the sea bass you'll be able to feel the bones and they come out pretty easily yet to make there's always a couple at the front where the fill it connects to the head so make sure we remove all of them that's one of them done go for the next one and just repeat the process again just make sure you've got a little pot of water as well just to wash off the bones that you take them out one by one obviously it's very important to remove all of these before cooking done big customer chewing down on them against stuffing arthritis because warm left there we want you sure just run your finger down a couple of times just to double-check and then we're just going to pour up the Phillies now so it's going to take the belly off and just we get a nice neat portion so we move a little bit that's just writing it up then we want to be going for about 120 130 grand portion of bass in that's quite a nice portion size but I say the

cook them till they're really tender blitz them up no cream just a pure flavor the sweet corn and then we've also got a chicken veloute which is going to finish this with and that is a reduction of white wine shallots garlic and thyme then we deglaze that with the chicken stock reduce that by two-thirds add double cream bringing up to the boil strain it up and then we whisk in a little bit of
