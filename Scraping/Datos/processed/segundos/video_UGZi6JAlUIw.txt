hi this is Jeff with armadillo pepper the hot sauce barbecue sauce jerky and fiery snack store it's the fourth of July week and this evening we're going to show you how to grill grouper now a lot of folks are a little bit shy when it comes to grilling fish because the fish sticks to the grill and it just ends up being a mess we'll show you two or three little tricks here that will make that a lot easier for you grilled grouper is a awesome fish whether you're grilling it or begging whatever is such a great fish to have we're going to season this grouper lightly what I like to use is its Everglades fish and chicken seasoning it's not overpowering it's got a nice flavor to it grouper itself is a great tasting fish so at least here we don't like to add a lot of really strong seasoning to overpower the fish but this Everglades fish and chicken it's a real nice complement to it now you know you can do your own online search if you want to put with your own recipe that's great too everything we show you here will still apply you know whatever recipe to whatever recipe you're using now the first thing you want to do is heat your girl free to give up grill and make it very hot you don't want to put the fish on a medium or medium low grill you want to cook it quickly roughly five six minutes each side you'll see I've got some real nice grouper place here we went to the fish market today so you want to have a high heat what you also want to do is pre grease or pre-oiled the grill and I will show you how to do that then we'll place the grouper on the grill we'll let it cook five or six minutes on one side flip it over five or six minutes and remove it you don't want to grill fish like you might steak or a chop or you turning multiple times trying to get that nice crisscross here on the state you don't want to do that with fish the more you touch it the more you run into the problems of the fish falling apart on the grill so the first thing I'm going to do here is drizzle the grouper with some olive oil just drizzle this up a little bit I've got this nice little brush so that we can make it nice and even then we're just going to season this as I mentioned with the Everglades fish and chicken now the olive oil will help this seasoning stick as well as it will help to prevent the grouper from sticking on the grill I'm just going to turn these fillets over same thing little olive oil it's more seasoning as soon as we get this grouper seasoned up which we're almost done I'll show you how to prepare the grill all right what I've gone here is just some regular oil you don't need to use the expensive olive oil to cook this the grates on this grill to keep the fish from sticking so I think this might have been canola oil whatever I had in the pantry now the grill I've got set on medium-high I don't know you know how accurate the gauges says it's 700 degrees but I can't tell you it's pretty hot and then what I'm going to do is just take a pair of tongs and I've got a clean rag here we're going to soak up the oil and then just rub it on the grill grates now you know you do need to use caution here and be careful you can certainly start a fire or burn yourself if you're not paying attention while you're doing I've got just a little bit more here yeah you can do this with paper towels I've got plenty of these old rags so I don't mind using them and the next thing we're going to do is put the roofer on this grill and we'll let these gripper fillets cook like as I mentioned earlier about five or six minutes each side you do want to keep an eye on them just in case you get some flare-up from the oil that you put on the grill race it's been right around six minutes you can see the grouper they're the tips of it are starting to curl up and there's some juice laying here in the grouper so it's time to turn this now I like to use two different spatulas because these are pretty long plays don't worry you're going no matter what you do you will get a little stick yeah if you want to be a little bit more gentle and it wasn't that first piece then what I'm going to do here is just sprinkle a little lime fresh lime juice and I can't help myself oh my gosh we're going to close this up and let it cook about four or five minutes on this side we've been about five minutes on the other side our grouper is nice and ready we just remove our grouper fillets from the grill just going to put a little bit more fresh line here lime juice I should say look at those absolutely beautiful so there you have real grouper fillets you can see how easy it is to make these you don't have to be intimidated by fish on the grill again my name is Jeff with armadillo pepper you can check us out at armadillo pepper comm or see what we're up to over on Facebook
