tonight I'm gonna make pot roast I just got home from work it's a Monday night and I figure let's have pot roast for dinner this recipe should take about an hour and 10 minutes total cook time so it's 5:30 we'll eat about seven o'clock by the time we're all done I'm I'm kind of excited because this is a different instant pop in than one I've used before I sent the folks at the company an email about my videos and they sent me duo 60 and this is a 6 quart like my other one my other instant pot is the lux and so I'm going to learn what are the little differences between these two machines the first thing I'm going to do to make this pot roast is hit the saute button what I've learned is that when you're going to brown meat before you put any oil in the pan get the pan really good and hot and then put the oil in so I'm just gonna let this pan get heat heat it up so well the the instant pot is getting hot before I put the oil in I've got about a two and a half pound boneless chuck roast and I am going to spice it with something from pennsie spices this is Quebec beef spice and I thought it I would I would try that out it has pepper and salt and sugar and coriander and garlic which sounds really good so I'm just rubbing that in here a little bit before I brown this meat okay now I think this is hot enough to pour my oil into pour about just kind of a skosh a couple of tablespoons maybe of canola oil I like to use canola oil when I'm trying to brown meat because you can get it hotter than you can olive oil so now yeah that's good and sizzling I'm gonna put this meat in here and Brown that on all sides for about three minutes per side so it's taken most of my adult life to figure out how to get a really good sear on a piece of meat and so as I said you gotta get the pot good and hot before you put the oil in and then put the oil in and then put the meat in but the other thing you got to do when they put the meat in just let it sit for at least three minutes aside and he gets that nice brown on it so every side needs to be in that oil for for about three minutes get that nice Brown and don't move it around don't check it don't flip it okay so this meat I've steered it not only on the top and the bottom but on the side I'm gonna pop this out of here I think that looks pretty nice I'm gonna put it on a clean plate and now what I'm gonna do is I've got about two cups of sweet onions and some garlic and I'm just gonna Brown this until the onions and garlic start to get soft and then I'll put that meat back in and let it cook for an hour okay so the onions have cooked the onions and garlic have cooked for about three or four minutes and I'm gonna pour in one in 3/4 cups of beef broth and about what is this this is half a cup of red wine and what I'm gonna do is let that heat up just a minute to get all that good meat pieces little the little flavorings off the bottom just to deglaze that pan a little bit okay and now put my my pot roots back in there actually I have some really pretty from my garden thyme sprigs and I'm just gonna throw them in hole and put the pot roast back into the pot yeah and without splashing too much all right now if I can figure out my new instant pot one thing I like about it the duo as opposed to the lux is that it has this cool feature on the side where you can just hook the lid right up there I think that's pretty neat so I'm going to turn the instant pot off and put the lid on it and go with pressure cook pressure level on the duo can be high or low we're gonna go with high pressure and I'm gonna set the timer for an hour okay and I have to make sure that the valve at the top is set to sealing and that everything is secure and now I am going to relax until this roast is cooked and then I'm going to put some potatoes and carrots in for just a few minutes at the end to cook those with it okay so the pot roast has just finished pressure cooking and I'm gonna hit do it this  release on that I love watching that scene come out while that was cooking I chopped up a few potatoes some green beans some carrots a little bit of Swiss chard and what I'm gonna do when this is all done Benny is put that in there and cook for about ten more minutes okay so the little valve has gone down that means that I can now open this could you look at this what I love about this instant pot is I can just prop that right up the oh my goodness that it looks like really a lovely tender roast I'm gonna put these veggies in I cut up a few new potatoes green beans and carrots and now what I'm gonna do suppose my instant pot I can remember how to do this oh yeah I know put it on ceiling and hit pressure cook on high for 10 more Lipson I want it as an hour let it down for just ten minutes and that'll be plenty of time for those vegetables to cook you could put the vegetables in at the beginning but I was just afraid they'd get really mushy so I just want to do it this way and then I think we're gonna have a really lovely dinner okay so I cooked those veggies for 10 minutes on pressure-cook and then I let them do a natural release for 10 minutes so we're gonna vent that and that'll take just a couple minutes to get all that steam out of there and then I think we're ready for dinner okay so the valve popped down it's done venting whew this looks pretty good let me have a look oh yeah those potatoes are lovely now what I'm gonna do I'm pulling this pot roast look at how that's just falling apart which is exactly what I want it okay so it smells really good and I'm gonna put my potatoes and carrots and onions and everything in there so one thing I'm gonna do there's a there's the the little string that was that was holding that pot roast together that's out of here Pyrus looks so good and it like it's kind of falling apart I'm gonna take a bite of that mmm it's really good when I have cooked pot roast in a big cast-iron Dutch oven on the stovetop for the most part it's turned out pretty dry but this is really really good and it is just falling apart so we're ready to eat and I hope you will try this I am pretty excited I love having pot roast for supper on a Monday night after work and I hope you enjoyed this video if you did like my channel and I hope you enjoy cooking with your instant pot thanks
