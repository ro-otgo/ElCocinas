hey y'all I'm Paula Deen everybody knows that a meal just ain't complete without dessert so I'm gonna devote this entire episode to those sweet endings that can make your meal memorable first I'm gonna be making a sinful raspberry sherry trifle with layers of fruit custard and cream next I'm gonna have a twist on a traditional Eclair and this ain't your grandma's recipe this isn't a Claire cake and just in case that's not rich enough I'm gonna be making a peanut butter and cheese fudge this guaranteed to hit the spot so get ready everybody to indulge because there's about to be a sugary buffet coming y'all's way you you know some days it's hard for me to believe that I'm working well today is one of those days because guess what today's show is it's sweet endings that's right everything I'm making today is sweet but in order to get to those sweet endings we got to have a beginning so why don't we start today with probably one of my favorite trifles it's a raspberry sherry trifle now for our trifle I've started by baking off a yellow butter cake mix just an ordinary box cake mix that you get at your grocery store and it should be ready I've baked it in a 13 by 9 by 2 pan and I'm gonna pull it out and let it cool while we're making our custard this smells really really good the cake has moved away from the side of the pan and that lets me know that the cake is done so we're just gonna leave that sitting right here let it cool and I'm gonna step over to the stove and I'm gonna start the custard fire raspberry trifle I've got me a glass bowl and I've placed it over hot water now it's important that you don't let the water touch the bottom of your bowl now I'm just gonna bring that up to a bowl I've got seven egg yolks in my bowl into that I'm gonna add 3/4 of a cup of sugar okay I'm just gonna beat that up and to this I'm gonna add one cup of sherry now it's very important that you don't use a cooking sherry if it's not good enough for you to pour into a glass and drink then don't put it in your food now I'm just gonna mix these up and we're gonna cook it for about eight minutes over the boiling water until it kind of looks like mayonnaise so what are we gonna do five minutes show how about if we chat I want to show you on something that came in the mail today this very day it came in the mail today take a look over here to my right would you believe it's a Paula Deen doll a girl said that to me today and let's see certificate of authenticity this doll is from woodland face angel doll collection and Paula Deen has received a full facial repaint which I needed so bad I appreciate that one this doll is an original design by the artist Gail Jaber otherwise known as Gabby Gabby thanks so much I couldn't believe it all right now that's been whisked up real real well and in the meantime I've already got a batch of the cream made that's been putting the refrigerating cooled so it's ready for us to put together and you can see the consistency of it all right now I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna take two cups of heavy cream and I'm gonna add two tablespoons of powdered sugar now I'm gonna beat this until it forms stiff peaks now if you want to ensure yourself that your whipping cream turns out perfectly you'll want to use a chilled fold and you want to chill your beaters all right so I'm gonna sit that to the side for a second and bring in our cold custard now I'm gonna take about half of our heavy cream and I'm gonna fold it in to our custard and when I say fold that means you'll want to take your spatula go down and over and that whipping cream is gonna make your custard light all right now I'm gonna come over here and get our cake bring it over here and you can just cut this or tear it into small kind of 1-inch pieces and you can see that the bowl I'm selected for my trifle is a glass bowl cuz it's just real neat looking kind of shows it off really really good all right so we're gonna do 1/3 of the cake and then I'm gonna come up here because the next step is gonna be on raspberries and I'm using 310 ounce boxes of frozen raspberries set up and thawed if you don't like raspberries you can always use blueberries or strawberries right now I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna put a layer of custard why don't y'all go get you something to drink while I finish putting our trifle together and when we come back I'm gonna be making Eclair cake that's really really delicious and then even later on I'm gonna take three three ingredients that are probably some of my favorites and I'm gonna combine them all into one kick-butt dessert so I'll see y'all back in a few minutes [Music] hey while y'all were gone I finished getting a trifle together look how beautiful it looks look at that y'all I got a little bit of raspberry mmm that's so delicious if you're a raspberry fan this is gonna be right up there among your favorites it's truly delicious and guess what I'm making next y'all I'm gonna be making Eclair cake now I've gotten my casserole dish buttered and I'm gonna line it with graham crackers and you just do this any way you can if they overlap you know it's alright just however you need to get the job done all right now we've got our crust ready and that was very very simple wanting it kind of crust I like now we're gonna come over to this bowl and I'm gonna take instant french vanilla pudding and I'm gonna mix that with three and a half cups of milk all right I'm gonna beat this for about two two-and-a-half minutes now for some reason you don't like instant puddings you can get the cooked type pudding and just need to let that cool low before you put it together all right that looks great now I'm gonna take a small container of frozen whipped topping that's been thawed and I'm gonna take this and fold it in and you don't have to be extremely careful with this because that whipped toppings not gonna break really about the only way it would break is if you hadn't thought it well and you tried to stir it it would just it would just deflate on you just down to nothing now that's the custard part of our Eclair we've got our crust we've got our custard and if you'll move on down here with me we're going to make the chocolate part of our Claire so I've got my confectioner sugar and that's one and a half cups and then I've got a half a cup of unsweetened cocoa and I'm just going to stir those two ingredients together and then I'm gonna run them through my little strainer just to make sure that I get all the lumps out of them today is such a beautiful day it's been so windy here the last couple of days so I'm really glad to see that the winds died down and the Sun is out all right now I've got our cocoa and our powdered sugar mixed together now I'm going to take three tablespoons of room-temperature butter and I'm gonna cut into our dry ingredients now I'm going to add a couple of teaspoons of a white corn syrup all right that felt about like two teaspoons and now I'm gonna add two teaspoons of vanilla flavoring I'm just gonna mix that up I think I'm gonna use like a third of a cup of milk and if it still too thick for you then just add a little bit more milk oh it's looking good don't you just love it when you can find a 10-minute dessert like this that you can whip together at the last minute all right now we're gonna come back over here and we're gonna put a layer of our custard over our first layer of graham crackers and I'm gonna kind of gently just spread it over those crackers all right now we're gonna make another layer using our graham crackers all right now we're gonna come back with the rest of our cream filling over that second layer of graham crackers this kind of reminds me a little bit these steps right here kind of remind me a little bit of nacho Mama's banana pudding we're gonna spread that out again all right now one more layer of crust all right now we're gonna grab our chocolate filling that we just mixed up and you can see the consistency of our chocolate and then we're just gonna drizzle it which is come true easily over those graham crackers now this is gonna tighten up some y'all because we're gonna put this in the refrigerator and let it chill so you can see now why this is called an eclair cake you know this is truly like a five or ten minute dessert I think the family will love it especially chocolate lovers and it'll be a lot easier than getting in there and making your traditional eclairs so I'm gonna cover this and put it in the refrigerator and when we come back one of my desserts that contain like three of my favorite foods so I want you to come back with me and let me share this recipe with you and then after that why do things go wrong well I'm gonna see if I can help you fix it I'll see y'all back a couple of minutes I told y'all about my three favorite ingredients well here they are it's butter cheese and peanut butter now I know y'all are thinking Paulo what are you fixing to do next well I'm fixing to make us a quick delicious peanut butter cheesy fudge and you're not gonna believe how quick this is gonna come together and I'm gonna melt a half a pound of processed cheese and give that a little head start because that takes longer to melt than our butter does so I'm just gonna give that a little head start all right now I'm gonna go ahead and add the butter and I'm just gonna stir this and this is probably the longest step to making this peanut butter fudge is melting that cheese now I have to tell you that I want to talk about the recipe a minute and tell you where it came from a friend of mine sent this to me quite a few years ago this recipe for cheese fudge and I just couldn't believe it when I made it that it was so wonderful so I made it with the cocoa and the nuts and I said you know this would really be good use this basic same recipe except leave out the cocoa and add peanut butter and make peanut butter fudge while I tried it and it was perfectly delicious and the cheese and the butter has finally melted now I'm gonna take it off the heat and I'm gonna pour this over to one pound boxes of confectioner's sugar but before I do that I'm gonna throw in this peanut butter so that won't take that but a second to melt down now I'm gonna pour our butter and our cheese and our peanut butter into a powdered sugar and I'm gonna add a cup of nuts now I'm gonna be adding chopped pecans but if you wanted to because you're using peanut butter you could add chopped peanuts and that would be real good also and I'm gonna toss in 1 teaspoon of vanilla and this is kind of a messy job but really there's a reward at the end cuz you get to lick your fingers because about the only way to really get this mixed together real real good is to get in there with your hands and I think I'm just about to that point and in we go and you can see how stiff this is but the heat from my hands just breaks down that confectionery sugar very very quickly cuz you see if I would kept trying to stir that in it would have taken so much longer all right I'm gonna take an 8x8 pan and I'm gonna give it a spray because I want this I got a lot of butter in there but I still want to make sure that when I go to cut my fudge that it comes out nice and easy so I'm just gonna transfer that to my dish and press it and if you find when you get through patting it out that you feel like there's too much butter although I've never heard of such a thing you may think it is so you can just take a paper towel and blot the top of your candy just like that all right I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator and it's not gonna have to sit hardly any time before I can cut it and when I come back I'm gonna be tasting all these things because y'all don't know and I don't know if I've made them right do we its I gotta taste them and also I'm gonna help you out with some solutions the problems that you may have in the kitchen you you know I don't think there's anything more aggravating than being in the middle of a recipe only to find that you're missing an ingredient so I hope a few of these substitutes that I have for you today will help you out when you're in a crunch say for instance a recipe calls for two tablespoons of flour you don't have flour well not to worry you can substitute that with one tablespoon of cornstarch all right you've pulled out that cake mixture all ready to go only to find you don't have all in eggs don't worry about that either because one cup of yogurt is the perfect substitute for your oil in your eggs I'm forever running out of milk so to get that one cup of milk all I have to do is take 1/2 a cup of evaporated milk add a half a cup of water to it and I've got 1 cup of whole milk like I said I hope these will help you out when you've got an emergency what a perfect setting for some sweet endings I swear to Pete I have had the best time today and you know what out of all the desserts I've made today I don't know which I like the best the raspberry and sherry trifle or the Eclair cake or this peanut butter fudge I I really don't know you know I've got a a great diversified tastes for all palates for the chocolate lover [Music] that tastes so much like an eclair in the trifle if you like raspberries you're gonna love this dish but you know Cody I think that maybe the peanut butter fudge maybe my favorite tell me what you think [Music] what's good thanks buddy good mood I hope y'all will use these recipes and love them as much as my family does so until next time y'all the dogs and I would love to send you love and best dishes from our sweet endings to yours
