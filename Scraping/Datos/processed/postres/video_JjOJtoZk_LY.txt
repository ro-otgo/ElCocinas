- Whoa! (chuckles) 12 days of Christmas cookies, y'all! I think this recipe is gonna. be a huge hit with y'all. 'Cause guess what? You. don't have to bake 'em. Which, you know, that's a bonus. And this recipe was sent in to me from Tammy Dubrula, from. Harpers Ferry, West Virginia Beautiful part of our. United States, y'all. And she said, "Hi Paula.. Hope you'll try these. They are delicious. And. they're so easy to make." Yay, cornflake balls. So, what you say, let's get starting. The quicker we get 'em made,. the quicker they cool 'em the quicker we can eat them. Like I said, there is no baking. There is a little. melting of stuff, though. And we are gonna start by. melting our white sugar, along with a cup of white Karo syrup, which I used to love as a child. on my pancakes and waffles. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Okay, so we're gonna just heat. this up on top of the stove until all the sugar is dissolved. All right. Tammy tells us to. put this over like medium heat and bring it to a boil, and make sure your sugar is dissolved. So the next thing we're gonna do, is we're gonna add a 12-ounce. jar of peanut butter to this. But, we're gonna take it off the heat, to let that melt. So, here we go. I think I want a harder utensil. (utensils rustling) I love this thing right here. Didn't somebody send me this? - [Eddie] Yes.. - Oh my gosh. - [Eddie] Peanut butter person. - Thank you, thank you,. thank you. I love it. Huh? - [Eddie] The buttery. - Oh yes! The butter girl! Well, I love it. See, that reached all the way. down in there to the bottom. Got it good. So we have a cookie that's easy. Healthy. Protein. I mean, what more can. we ask for in a cookie? You don't have to bake. it. That is the bonus. So we're just gonna stir this,. per Tammy's instructions. Good to the last drop. I wish one of the grandchildren were here. They could have fun licking that utensil. All right, so I'm just gonna stir this. Let that peanut butter. melt, all in our sugar and our white Karo syrup. And while our poonup butter. (laughs) Teresa and I both are having. trouble using our words today. - [Teresa] Yes. It's. not been a good thing. - I don't know. Is it our teeth, or - - [Teresa] I don't know.. - Our brain. - [Teresa] I'm a little worried.. Yet again. (Paula laughing) - Okay, that's melting pretty good. So while that finishes. its melting process, I'm gonna put in four. cups of cornflake cereal. And this is not sweetened. And I'm gonna add one. cup. This is a little shy. So I'm gonna ask y'all's. patience just for a minute. 'Cause I'm gonna look and see. if I have some more coconut. Okay. I found some, y'all. Quite often, when I use coconut, I don't ever use the full bag. So I just tied it up real good. Stick it in my freezer, and it's ready and waiting on me when I need it. So, gonna mix these together. I'll check on our stuff, our good stuff. And it is all melted. So Tammy tells us to just pour this over our cereal and our coconut mixture. This just making me smile.. I can't help it. (laughs) What a bonus. I mean, this is one of those cookies that would be great to. do with the children or grandchildren, you know? I mean, you don't have to worry. about them getting burned. And of course they love to get. their hands all in the stuff. All right. So, I don't. know how hot that is, so I'm gonna do it like this first. (cereal crunching) (Paula laughing) Tammy, girl, thank you. Thank you, Tammy, from West Virginia. Mm. Mm. Wanna dig deep and bring. it up and around and down. Oh, my granny's. (Paula laughing) Yum. Mm! Y'all hear me crunching? Can you hear the crunch? - [Teresa] Crunch, crunch, crunch. - I love it. She doesn't say anything. about mixing till cool, or anything like that. She just says, mix thoroughly. And then form them into. walnut-sized balls. I'm thinking that I'm gonna. need to do this to my hands 'cause I could wind up eating. more than, (Paula laughs) more than I'm supposed to. Mm. Mm mm mmm. Is that the size of your walnuts, Tammy? Sometimes, mine be pretty big. No, Eddie? You say "no"?. - [Eddie] No, that's - - Is it bigger than a walnut? - [Eddie] I think so.. - [Teresa] Yes. - [Eddie] That's bigger than a golf ball. That's bigger than - - [Teresa] I would say golf ball. - Okay. (Paula laughs) Tammy, I love this cookie, mainly 'cause you didn't have to bake it. All you had to do was melt your sugar and your white Karo syrup. and your peanut butter. And that was it. Look, I. put these on a platter, so it looks like Santa Claus's beard. Ain't that cute? And I guess we could, let's see if I can find some good ones. And do for his eyes. No, when you take away his eyes, it looks different, doesn't it? Well, I tell you what, Tammy. While I was dipping these up, I got a little bit on my hand, so I had to get it off. (Paula laughs) Cheers. So good!
