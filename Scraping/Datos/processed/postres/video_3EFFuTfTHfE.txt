[Music] thank you so much we had a great time let's do it again okay let's do it well I can't do it today but why don't we do it through the food let's do it you want to what we could how does chocolate creme brulee sound to go no custard and creamy and warm and color with the melted sugar topping enough let's do it so I've got eight eggs that I need to separate y'all and I just need the yolks and then you've got cream mmm three cups of heavy cream how long does it mean since we made that tree up that's been a few years I think maybe four years are we married yeah you know in a way it seems like it's been forever no no instead of just three or four years well we packed a lot in short marriage we have we had to make up for lost time in Michael's pot now he's got a one-out square of unsweetened chocolate that he's chopped just watching Michael in Paris y'all looking in all those store windows with all the chocolate and the pastries and the bread Michael was literally in hog heaven all right now tell everybody what you're doing Mike put two and a half tablespoons of liquor a wonderful chocolate liqueur we're gonna put 3/4 a cup of sugar y'all one tablespoon and one and a half teaspoons will cook up so you've got almost two tablespoons of cocoa y'all three teaspoons make a tablespoon so we're just a little shy of two tables so you could always if you didn't want to fool with getting that precise you could always just put in a couple of tablespoons cuz a little bit more chocolate ain't gonna hurt easy okay now we'll add our vanilla last Peepaw okay wait because we don't yeah we don't want to vanilla flavoring to cook out right and then I'm just gonna beat these eggs up after this gets warm we're gonna temper our eggs and put it back in here so tell me what was your favorite favorite chocolate Sheldon I assume the chocolate it was the chocolate but it was an incredible place it had all kind of chocolates and I could have been locked up there overnight as a fancy you want to know what my favorite was can't remember the name of the restaurant but y'all it was fabulous they they the one that we see they hit this button and this ceiling folded back you were sitting here in this formal dining room and then all of a sudden you were eaten under the stars it was fabulous at a moment it did cut back but now we're in there before you have a baby okay one hour want you to hold off on it but you go ahead and put it okay all right now Michael I just want to see what this feels like oh my goodness that coffee look cooler I'll put that vanilla extract in it's a perfect time I mean perfect timing Michael's always right young you can say that again Michael's always right all right so this is warming up Michael okay so what I want you to do is just pour me a little bit because we want to temper that and tempering just means slowly bringing up the heat because we don't want our brulee don't wind up like chocolate scrambled eggs yes okay all right so now we're just gonna transfer this back to the pot then we're gonna finish mixing it all together all right now pour it over in here Mikey all right now Michael yes I had my strainer up here just in case that lumped up on us but it didn't lump this is really beautiful now we're gonna cook these in a water bath then what I want you to do Michael huh is get your ball in water and we're gonna fill up our baking dish y'all about halfway full so yes go ahead and then that way I won't have to worry about you dumping hot water in my creme brulee about halfway you say perfect no you can't all right I'm just gonna fill up all these ramekins look at that and I'm gonna have almost Michael six completely full cups we're gonna cook it in a slow oven y'all 300 degrees for about 30 to 45 minutes you know we don't mind even 45 our first dessert always dessert first life is short dessert I'm gonna finish up our chocolate brulee and I'm just gonna sprinkle a little sugar on these show and then I'm gonna fire them that fire is gonna make that sugar just melt all on top of these now I've chilled these brûlées in the refrigerator so they're nice and cold y'all look I'm making a mess with the sugar and I don't care that's absolutely fine because I want to get it evenly over it all right so here we go y'all ready the hairspray techniques scared I love doing this you just want to be careful that you don't score you don't get this on fire yes that's one of the things you have to be careful long as I get these done would you curl me some chocolate and we're gonna put a little bit more sugar see I like sugar all around those pages I want a lot of crystal they really good I've just waiting on something catch fire and it'll probably be my Oh because I'm really close to your head all right Matt
