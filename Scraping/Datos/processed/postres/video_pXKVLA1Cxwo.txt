- Hey, y'all come on in the kitchen. Cause you know what? Today is another day about air frying. And I'm gonna make these fried candy bars. (chuckles) Another great quick dessert that you can sit down to. the table to eat your dinner or your lunch and pop these in your air. fryer while you're eating. And when you're done, these will be ready for your dessert. And I tell you what a scoop of ice cream along with these could be really, really, really good. Now you can use any. kind of candy you want, but I'm using the little. candy bars, you know, that are individually wrapped. You can buy a big bag of them and they come in like the crispy, what do they call those? That's got like the cereal in it. - [Teresa] Crackles - [Paula] Crackles, yeah. And then they make the dark chocolate, which I don't care for,. but Teresa loves it. And my favorite just the. milk chocolate candy. And this one is... Oh gosh, what is the name of that? - [Teresa] Mr. Goodbar. - Mr. Goodbar, yes. It's got peanuts in it. and the milk chocolate. So all I'm gonna do... I'm using like a bar and a half. The recipe calls for just one bar, but you know how little miss piggy is. I wanna(laughs) I wanna make sure I got. plenty of chocolate. So I'm gonna try doing the one and a half and see how that works. And that seems to work pretty good. Pretty good. So I'm gonna continue. on with one and a half. All right, this is gonna. be the milk chocolate. And you wanna start at your begging end. There you go. Tuck that up there and tuck that in there. I'm gone wet it with a little egg so it will stick. I'm gone rub this one with a. little egg so that'll stick. And I'm gone rub this one with. a little egg so it'll stick. Cause I don't want that. chocolate escaping. Okay. So now we're gonna do the dark chocolate. We need to Mark this one somehow Eddy. So you and I won't(laughs) won't get the dark chocolate.(chuckles) All right. Coming under the belly. Wetting that. Then I'm gone wet that. Just like that. Okay, the last one is the crackle. And here we go.(chuckles) Okay. Seal that up. Oops. Gone seal that up too. Am going to seal this side up. Then gone seal this little flapper. Alright, so now we're gonna brush these with a... With whole egg that we've just mixed up and put a little water in it. It might help it... It might help it just go. a little bit smoother, but we definitely want that shiny finish. We'll do a little underneath because we have made the decision that we're not gonna flip these. We're gonna just let them. cook for the whole... Is it ten minutes? Yeah. So in they go, into the air fryer. These are gonna be so good.(laughs) Dough and chocolate, I can't. think of anything any better. Right, now let me check if there's something right on the time. 375, 80 for five minutes. And it says turn over and. cook for two more minutes. So let's just put it on for. seven minutes all total. Okay. (fryer roaring) Look, I'll eat that milk chocolate. Which do you want? Crackle, dark or Mr. Goodbar? - [Eddy] Mr. Goodbar. - That's Mr. Goodbar. Let Broom Hilda have that dark chocolate. (laughing) That's what she said she likes.(laughs) - [Teresa] It's good for your health. - I know. Now one thing I like wine. and a dark chocolate bar. They say that it's good for ya. - [Teresa] I don't know Paula. (water splashing) - I guess cause I'd rather. have a glass of sweet tea and a piece of cake.(laughs) Okay, seven minutes. All right y'all, seven. minutes in the air fryer. We did not turn them over and they got nice and brown because I had brushed. the bottoms with the egg. So no need to turn them. And I just love... I just love little. begger purses, you know, no matter what they got in them. I just like them. And so y'all, I've got...(laughs) I asked Eddy, I said, "Eddy would you make me some of that icing that you make that is so good?" Just the confectioner, sugar and water. He said, "well there was a. little bit more than that, yeah. (laughs). Paula." So he said I've got. some in the refrigerator from the salmon rolls that. we made the other day. Well, tell them how you make it Eddy. This stuff, I could eat with a spoon. It's not just... All right, come on drizzle. Tell them what it is. - [Eddy] It is powdered sugar, some half and half. - [Paula] Mm hmm - [Eddy] Some cream cheese all whipped up. - [Paula] Mm hmm. - [Eddy] And did I say. powdered sugar?(laughs) - [Paula] You did not. say almond flavoring. - [Eddy] And then almond flavoring, yeah. - [Paula] And we poured that all over those hot cinnamon rolls y'all and it was out of this world. I might, should have heated. this a little bit more Eddy. - [Eddy] I kinda like it thick. - You like thick, okay. I do too, so here we go. (laughing) That's what we like. It's about what we like, isn't it? And it's what I tell my friends out there. It's all about what you like. Just cause I say do it that way that don't mean you have to. You do it the way you want it. Oh Gosh. And now remember what's. inside of there y'all.(laughs) Those candy bars. Ooh! But you know what? I got 'em mixed up and I. don't know which is Teresa's. That dark chocolate. I don't want any dark chocolate. What is that? Mr. Peanut.. - [Teresa] Crackle? Mr. Goodbar.. - Is it crackle? Mr. Goodbar. So eenie, meenie, minie mo. Catch a tiger by his toe. If he hollers, let him go. I don't want dark chocolate. - [Teresa] I hope you get it. (laughing) So dig in. - Okay. This might be yours. Is that... That's dark chocolate, isn't?. (laughing) Come here Teresa, that's yours you heifer. (laughing) - [Teresa] I knew it. That's what happens when you are ogling about chocolate.. - [Paula] Look and see... Look and see if that's not dark chocolate. - [Teresa] Oh yeah. (laughing) - [Paula] All right Let's. see what this one is. - [Teresa] Oh I don't know.

If I give you a bunch of them and then just put it out.. - I know it's like that box of candy. - [Teresa] Mm hmm. - You never know. I've bitten a many of candy bar, little bite of candy half in two.(laughs) And then throwing it away started on the next.. - And then put it back in the box.(laughs) That Mr. Goodbar, because it's got peanuts in it.
