[Music] all right pecan pies I know you've probably all had a pecan pie but I've got a new pecan pie recipe for y'all and this was sent to me from a friend from New Orleans all right now I've got three eggs busted I'm gonna add some sugar and I'm gonna add some white corn syrup now a lot of people use white corn syrup for the pecan pies a lot of people use a dark corn syrup to me it doesn't too much make a difference as long as your syrup in it you're just gonna whisk this around it doesn't have to be beat up too too good all right and I'm gonna add the vanilla all right this is our syrup layer and this is gonna be the surprise layer that's in this pecan pie and we're gonna start with cream cheese a little bit more sugar a little salt to cut the sweetness you know what I mean a little more vanilla and one more egg and we're just going to incorporate that together a pecan pie is great for beginner so if you want to surprise the family pull this recipe out on them and see what happens all right now we're gonna add our cream cheese to the bottom of the pie looks like melted white chocolate doesn't it I'm just gonna kind of smear that around evenly here we go now I'm using a chopped pecan you can use a whole one but it makes it much much easier to slice by the piece when your nuts are chopped up like this one so you have to decide what you want all right now this is the standard filling right here for a pecan pie now all we're gonna do is take this and pour it on top of those nuts and then when this pie is done all the nuts will have risen to the top now if I can just get it to the oven without spilling it and you can see that I'm gonna bake this in a raw pie shell because this time actually gonna bake it for about 45 minutes so you don't want to pre-bake your shower it would get too Brown I got it in there without spilling it so we gonna come over here and check on this one oh my gracious look how good that looks I'm actually gonna put it over here in this corner cuz I got a great breeze coming in that door so I'm gonna let that sit right there and cool look at that mystery pecan pie have you ever seen a pecan pie with cream cheese in it neither have I I know you're gonna love it and as always I send y'all love and best dishes from my kitchen to yours [Music]
