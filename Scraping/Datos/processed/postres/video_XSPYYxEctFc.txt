so yah we made the peach cobbler earlier now I think I can't do this with gloves yo I just washed my hands but I've got to have my real fingers to do this one sorry I think this is the fourth show I've done for YouTube the very first one I did cracker salad you know I told John that I'm trying to come up with little things that hopefully you have in your pantry at home so we did the peach cobbler earlier well now I'm gonna share with you my fried pies and it has this airfryer of mine has just worked beautifully for my fried pies now this is what my grandmother Paul used I don't even know in her kitchen years if there was even so much if there was such thing as puff pastry back then I don't remember but I remember this I remember grandma taking her canned biscuits taking the cover off or wrapping it and saying I was so damn glad when they came out with these canned biscuits she loved the convenience of canned biscuits that's what she used to make a blackberry cobbler that's what she used to make her fried pies but I on the other hand prefer puff pastry that's my favorite I'll use a canned biscuit if I don't have any choice but I've taken my sheet of and look I cook 20 and had it ready for you I put a little dollop of butter on it because remember there was no butter yes no butter in it or on it oh so I am dampening the edges of my puff pastry you got to wet it a little bit so that you can seal it so I'm gonna put a scoop of my blueberry pudding I mean my blueberry cop my pie filling y'all and this comes in strawberry it comes in apple cherry cherry it just comes in so many flavors is there a dishrag right there that I can thank you Eddie Oh comes in a lot of flavors and this is the most convenient way to make fried pies I've got my mushrooms thank you I've got my mushroom I'm not my mushrooms my peaches and my pear trees out there and so I've got I've got fresh pears and fresh peaches in my freezer but we would have to take those out sweeten them cook them down and then we would have to thicken them with cornstarch because this pie filling has to be thick if it was spinning it would run all out we would have no juice all right so I've got those sides nice and damp so we're just gonna fold it over now you get in puff pastry you get two sheets why do my puff pastry box oh don't worry about it you get two sheets and I take my my itty-bitty baby rolling pin and roll that sheet of puff pastry out just a little bit so it's not quite so thick and I get four fried pies out of one sheet of puff pastry so in order to make sure this is feels good and my pie filling doesn't come out I'm putting my times of my fork in flour and I'm just coming around like that making sure it's good and sealed all right now I kind of like a shiny finish so I'm going to wait you know what I'm gonna go ahead and make another pie before I do that I think I'll make three pies because that's what I've got laid out okay so these are so simple y'all it's almost silly they're so simple and people will just think that you've been to a lot of trouble my favorite fried pie of all fried pies believe it or not y'all is pear and then apple is my favorite after that one and peach is probably my least favorite fried pie and I can't tell you why cuz I love peaches I love peach cobbler but when it comes to fried pies I I love those pears now this puff pastry when you thaw it out it comes tri folded and when you unfold it well it takes a few minutes but to thaw out before you can unfold it but as soon as it starts falling you can gently unfold it and then it it thaws out really really quick when you spread it out and I sprinkled a little powder on my piece of parchment paper so I could roll that crust out a little thinner okay so here we go just that quickly I've made three front well actually I made four because I had one for y'all to see and I think I cooked him about 10 minutes in the air fryer that grandmama and myself have always fried these on top of the stove and a nice big skillet with maybe half an inch or each of grease all whatever you use to cook the frying and that makes them really tasty but I have realized the value of that airfryer y'all I can get basically the same effect without any grease ever touching it so that really helps me on my watching my intake of fat now I've just used just the egg yolk for this and you see how pretty and yellow that is so it made it made that pie like a pretty golden brown I'm gonna I've got room for probably one more but I could probably do four but I'm just gonna do three and I did after the top started getting brown y'all I did flip them over for a few minutes because I didn't want a doughy bottom on my pie I wanted to make sure it was all nice and brown all the way around I don't know who came up with that puff pastry y'all but I could kiss them square on the lips because I've never had a desire to try to make my own and I admire people very much that are into making all those delicate breads but I've always just been a housewife trying to beat the clock you know what I mean so I'm gonna spray this I'm just gonna kiss it with a touch of I think this is canola no this is bacon but you can use any kind you like you can use the temperature you can find them in all different selections all right now I've got this on 350 and I'm putting for 10 minutes I don't like to I don't like to use my airfryer and put it 25 or 30 minutes because I would no matter what I'm cooking I like to at least check it at the end of ten minutes so and it's even less if I'm just eating up something so then we go just that simple what am I forgetting gang what am I forgetting reconnecting goodnight yeah [Music] that's a pretty good job and I know probably a lot of y'all keep these biscuits in your refrigerator the first one thing and then another so it really makes it convenient if you don't have an air fryer get your big frying pan load it with whatever kind of all you choose to use and fry them on top of the stove we're lazy one thing that but this is good and this is saving me some fats that I don't need whether one Eddie aunty Oh that is exactly the way I deserve it piggy asked if I would surf that with some ice cream yes yes all you think is just fresh sweetened whipped cream and those frozen whipped topping personally I don't use those I like the real deal but whatever your tongue likes that's the most important thing about all cooking that's what it depends on your tongue and I love y'all and I will be doing these some more please let me hear from you if you have any special requests and just remember we're all in this together and we are going to get through it and we'll come back stronger smarter than ever love and best wishes
