- [Paula] Eddie just said something that it reminded me of... Who, who did our.. - [Eddie] Our counters? - Uh-huh. - [Eddie] Uh, Ralph Chapman. with Creative Stone. - Ralph Chapman with Creative Stone. I just have to say that. those folks are so good. Ralph really cares about his final product And, um, my first. countertop that was in here he knew it wasn't right. Uh, that the, what hit the did the material done it. - [Eddie] It It was, um,. courtside and it was, it was, uh, warping, I mean, I mean it's a very - Yeah - [Eddie] it's a very. hard stone but it had - Yeah, it was warping. And, um, Ralph said "You. know we we can't have this, I want the project to be perfect." So, uh, they couldn't. get him on that stone so they asked me to come out and pick out another one. Is that right, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah, well,. the ones were picking out were were having the same issues. - Having the same issue, so, - [Eddie] So we different, - So Ralph said, - [Eddie] different direction (laughs) - Just go in a all new direction. So, um, seventeen years ago. when we built this house I put in this soap stone. And I liked it soap stone is beautiful. In fact, you can see some of the original, uh, soap stone is in the pantry. And, um, its been there. since the house was built, so, you know what I decided what the heck I'm just going back with soap stone because I know that I like that, and it was good, but, um, when they, when they finished putting it together, Eddie and I looked at it and I said Eddie... that um, (laughs) - [Eddie] Paint color - The island needs to be. painted white. (laughs) And he said, you know I. totally agree with you Paula. Because it was like dark and dark So, we'll get around to. painting the bottom white. One day won't we? (laughs) Someday we are going to get it done. But in case you think, what's different about her kitchen, that's what it is, it is soap stone. So, anyway, um, you know it is strawberry season. Eddie was telling me up where his mother lives in New Hampshire, there's, she's probably got another month before strawberries come in. They have like plant city flora, I mean, the strawberries are just... scrumptious! And, um, so in this issues magazine look, uh, there's a. story about my surprise birthday party that was thrown for me. And, uh, you see on the cover, I want to show you all, is this issue still out Eddie? - [Eddie] It's just coming out right now. - Oh, just coming out, good. - [Eddie] This is... - I don't mean to brag but this is a wonderful magazine y'all it is so so good. Uh, you know, just really. family friendly recipes. So, uh, this is the story on my surprise birthday party. And I want to show you that, that was my cake. Totally edible! And the flowers, uh, I mean that's not glass, that's cake! It's all cake! And, uh, I just could not get over it. In fact, I said, Eddie we've got to save those flowers. So, we took them out and they are know in the china cabinet. You want to show them how, what we did with them, Eddie? (footstep sounds) - [Paula] And the ladies. that made the cake uh, said they would last until the year. You know what, they're not as pink now as they were. - [Eddie] Yeah, yeah. - [Paula] The color, they. they kind of turning white. - [Eddie] I have a. feeling once the humidity hits here they may... - [Paula] Yeah, yeah. - [Eddie] They may be going away. (laughs) - [Paula] But Bonnie Bedingfield, uh, and Eliane Drewin. - [Eddie] Elaine make the flowers and Bonnie made the cake. - [Paula] Uh ah. Yes. So, those two girls are located, um, around the Atlanta area. - [Eddie] I'm thinking Newnan? - Newnan? - [Eddie] Newnan, Georgia? - [Paula] They are so incredibly good! And naturally Sissy Bubbles. Uh, told Michael and. Eddie about these girls and Susan arranged for them to delivery the cake to me. And it sat right over there and I, I just, I was just floored. All those folks surprised me. But I hope y'all can find an issue. And Peggy came. Oh, we had a good time. But if you see this magazine and you interested in seeing. about the surprise party you go pick that up. Plus, it is full of great recipes, in fact, um, I'm fixing a recipe today, from this magazine, and um, it's kind of a salute. to strawberry season. Alright, so I'm watching this over here, this one does not go. all the way up to 350, that candy thermometer. It's so old. But so anyway, this is very very simple to put together. I've got one and three fourths cup of all purpose flour. No, it's self rising, I'm sorry. One and a fourth cups of sugar, but that's divided. I've got one cup over here that I'm going to use later. So, a fourth of a cup of sugar. Into our self rising flour. And, I think it's a half a teaspoon, fourth of a teaspoon of salt. And... One and a fourth teaspoons of cinnamon divided so, uh, about. a fourth of a teaspoon is going into our actual batter. And we are just going. to blend that together. (stirring sounds) (glass clanging) (egg cracking) And we are going to put in one egg. (whisking sound) And we're just going to try to beat it up a little bit in this little bitty bowl. And we've got three fourths of a cup, two thirds of a cup, of buttermilk. (stirring sound) So, we're just going to. stir that all together. I'm worried about my... My oil over here getting too hot. I would fry 'em in my deep fryer but I hate to do that because I don't think most people have a deep fryer, so... I want to do this just like you would be doing if you're. doing it in your house. Plus I'm not crazy about that air, that deep fryer. (laughs) Okay, so this batter's going to be stiff. And, I am, using naturally fresh strawberries for these fritters. (stirring sounds) And, uh, (glass clanging sounds) Now I'm going to fold in one cup of fresh strawberries. That have been cut up and, uh, drained or dried. You want to just dry them off before, you, start dicing them. (stirring sounds) Oh, it looks good, good! And it smells so good! You smell the strawberries, Eddie? - [Eddie] Mmm hmm! - [Paula] All right, I want to make sure I've got everything right, ready when these come up. All right, I'm going to. get me some cold water. (water rushing) So, hopefully, I'll be able to, Okay, so I think, this candy thermometer. just goes up to 300. Which is a hard crack. So... All right, we're going to need something to drain these on, Theresa. - [Theresa] Okay. - [Paula] Um, please. (banging pot sounds) - [Theresa] Do you want something. like this to go over it? - [Theresa] Are you just going to... - Yeah, that that that, would be good. Or I can just drain it. on the paper towels. Okay, and then, uh, - [Theresa] Do you need a. bigger bowl to roll the? - No, I don't think so. - [Theresa] Okay. - I'm going to go ahead and, uh, add my cinnamon. A teaspoon of cinnamon. to the cup of flour. I mean, cup of sugar. (stirring sounds) - [Paula] And this is what we are going to roll our fritters in. (stirring sounds) (spoon clanging on glass) Okay, so I'm going to get my spoon in water and hopefully this batter will come out. all right off the spoon. (spoon clanging in glass) (sizzling sounds) Looking good! (spoon clanging in glass) (sizzling sounds) Oh, thank you, I, uh, this is where I make my hush puppies. If you water your spoon down every time. Uh... And you'll want to start. turning these pretty quickly. Because if you don't, they got top heavy. (sizzling sounds) And they don't want to stay flipped over. So, see what I'm saying? If you've ever... Put up, (laughs), turning back over. These are going to have to stay buddy, on that side, sorry. (sizzling sounds) And you too. Uh, they look so good! (sizzling sounds) So good! All right, now, our instructions tell us to, um, cook them for about four minutes. (sizzling sounds) And I'm going to cook them in kind of small batches so that I don't have to wait so long before I start turning them. (sizzling sounds) Yum! You know what, these would be good with a glaze. That would taste like a. strawberry donut, wouldn't it? (sizzling sounds) So if y'all do that let. me know, okay? (laughs) I'm going to want to know how it turns out if you decide to glaze them instead of rolling them. in the cinnamon sugar. Mm, look at that y'all! - [Theresa] Those are so pretty! - I say its been four minutes. And you can, uh, make these kind of any size you want. (glass clanging) In the book we recommend, just a scant... under a fourth of a cup. Now that was a good bit. Okay, so those should be all I need to be cooling off for me to, yeah, it's cool enough for me to touch. - [Theresa] I timed it. - [Paula] Yeah, yeah, oh good! Yeah, just keep flipping those Theresa, or either change places with me and roll, what you want to do? - [Theresa] I'll flip if you want to - [Paula] Okay. It don't matter to me cause. it's all got to get done. (mixing sounds) Those look good enough to eat! - [Theresa] Yeah. - My Grandma used to make up fritters. She would make apple fritters and, - [Theresa] And you could make this look, could you pretty much use the same recipe and change out your? - Oh, yeah. - [Theresa] First - Yes. I'm a glutton for punishment but I'm going try to finish. Use up all that batter. - [Theresa] Those are beautiful! - [Paula] Aren't they beautiful. - [Theresa] Think the babies will eat one? - I bet they would. If their Momma would. turn her back. (laughs) So I could give them to them! (laughs) I think all the babies would. I know Davis would. Davis has got a sweet tooth on you (Eddie laughs) like you wouldn't believe. He comes in and he says. "suck suck" "suck suck". He's looking for gimmes. Jar of suckers. (Theresa laughs) I said well I'm your. biggest sucker. (laughs) (stirring sounds) Okay, Eddie, do I have you takers to taste with me? - [Eddie] Oh yeah! - [Theresa] I'll hold the camera. - [Eddie] I think I can hold it. (Paula laughs) - [Theresa] Ohh! He ain't giving up. control, honey. (laughs) - [Theresa] He don't want. his face on the camera. - Do you want a hotter one? Or do you want one that is cool down? - [Eddie] I'll take a cooler one. - [Paula] Okay, I'll take the hotter one. - [Theresa] Be careful. (biting sounds) (chewing sounds) - [Eddie] It's good. - It is good. - [Eddie] Mmm hmm. - So next time I'll try with a glaze. And then the next time I'll try confection sugar. You know? - [Theresa] And blurberries? - Just dusty, uh, blueberries would be one. - [Theresa] Right after Easter. - [Paula] Uh ha. - Mmm, mmm, look at the mess I've made. You like it, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah, it's very good. (Paula laughs) - [Theresa] He can't eat. and film at the same time. (Paula laughs) Loving best dishes y'all.
