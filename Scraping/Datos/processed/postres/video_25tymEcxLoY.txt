- Hey, y'all, I'm back to Paula's quarantine cooking. shows, but you know what? I think we're going to. have to find another name for the show because I truly feel like we're on the tail. end of our quarantine. Hopefully very soon our. problems are going to be over with, but I'm not gonna. stop my cooking shows because I have loved. reconnecting with y'all again. And I get so many cards, so many letters so many recipes, and I love. each and every one of y'all. And I love the fact. that we are conversing. So let's think of a new name. Okay. Y'all help me, help me. So I am going to start off. I'm going to get this started,. and then we're going to talk. You want to talk, Theresa? - [Theresa] Let's talk.. - We're all talk. Alright, now where's my other sheet. I had another sheet. I don't know what I did with it - [Theresa] This one, but it's the same. - Oh, it's the same thing. - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - That may be a little. easier for me to read. I'm going to make a. chocolate chess pie today. And this recipe and request was sent in from Stacy Thompson. And this, this pie was. served at the Angus Barn in Raleigh, North Carolina,. and Stacy loves this pie. So she was gracious, gracious. enough to send me the recipe and she's tweaked it a little bit. So I'm going to make it. just like Stacy does. And like I said, I so. appreciate y'all's recipes. I just like, I like hearing. what, what y'all like out there and what y'all are doing. So I'm going to put a stick and a half of butter in a double ball or whatever. Thank you. Whatever kind of pot you're using. And that's like I said,. that's over boiling water. And so we go melt our butter. Our, let's see, how much Theresa. I can't even remember. An ounce and a half of unsweetened Baker's chocolate. And then Stacy said that she. added this to the recipe. A handful of Ghirardelli's. unsweetened chocolate. I think bittersweet,. bittersweet chocolate. She said, cause she just wanted a little. bit richer than what it was. So we got richer. Alright. So. We just gonna let that melt, and all I have to do is. just stir it occasionally. We'll turn that down a little bit. Cause you know, we're going to talk. What was in that? Oh the chocolate. I've already put that in there. Y'all. (chuckling) Look at me, I done put on my makeup today. - [Theresa] You look so pretty. - Oh, well thank you. - [Theresa] I told you to. tell them how pretty you are. - I ain't telling them how pretty I am. Cause I don't think I'm all that pretty, but I tell you what. Powder and paint makes us what we ain't. I'm addicted to powder and paint. So anyway, how many months now? Have, when did life stop for us? March?. - [Theresa] March, March 17th. - March, April, March 17th?. - [Theresa] 'Case we had no St. Patrick's Day. - That's exactly right. They cancel St. Patrick's day. And you know, Savannah has the second. largest celebration of St. Patrick's day in the United States. Second only behind New York city. And I think they cancel. theirs too, didn't they? Yeah. So hopefully we're getting back to normal, but that's March, April, May, June, July, August,. September, seven months. - [Theresa] Tell them. how your eye's doing. - Yes.. - [Theresa] Because remember, you've been off a little bit for that too. - That's what I'm getting. to, you know, we've been in quarantine for seven months,. almost eight months, right? Eddie.. - [Eddie] Yes. - And so when we were. quarantined, I started thinking about, you know, what can I do to just have the ability to pop. in to people's phones or iPads or computers and just. cheer them up a little bit. And so Bobby said, mama,. please, please do a cooking show on YouTube. So I asked Gabby, I. said, why am I not doing? And he said, I don't know. Nobody knew why I wasn't doing it. We hadn't thought of it. So I started doing it. And you saw me in a much more casual... - [Eddie] Atmosphere.. - In my real way, in my real self, you. know, in my atmosphere. So last night I had a two hour show with JTV and JTV is jewelry television. And I have a line of. jewelry that I come on with. And so it just got me. all hyped up last night. What is Emily's last name? I can't remember. - [Eddie] Peterson.. - [Paula] Pierce that's right. Emily Pierce.. - [Eddie] No, Peterson. - Peterson, Emily Peterson. One of the most wonderful sweet girls you could ever. hope to meet does my hair and makeup and nobody. can do it like Emily. Well Emily came in yesterday. and did my hair and makeup. And I did my show on. JTV and it was so nice. Cause every day I get up. and I look in the mirror and I say, oh, Paula, you. just got to be butt ugly the rest of your life. That's just the way it goes. You got a bum eye that you're not supposed. to be putting makeup on. So 73 and just butt ugly for life. Well, last night, Emily just fixed me up and I just almost felt pretty again. So I tried to duplicate it today. Course it's nothing like. Emily does, but you know what? I'm just, I'm just forewarning y'all. Some days you're going to see me looking like I just crawled out of bed and some days you're going to. see me where I tried to gussy up for you. But my hope is that you. enjoy these enough to put up with me being butt ugly. straight out of bed day. Right?. - [Theresa] That's it. - Because I've just got no. intention to leave y'all. Nobody can make me leave except y'all. So, ooh, look. Look, look, look. You know, now a chess pie, y'all. I've always thought of. a chess pie you know, having meal, corn meal,. mama used to make them. And she, I think she would. just sprinkle it on the top but you know, this, this recipe. does not call for any meal. Nope, no meal. So I guess chess pie recipes come in all different shapes and sizes. So I'm going to stop right here. and let this finish melting and we'll come back to. that after it's melted. So good to be back. But I want to tell y'all I do appreciate my sons taking full responsibility. of this stove while I was out with my eye. And, but you know, we're. a team, the three of us, we're a team. So you'll be seeing them right on. Okay gang we're back here, back on our chocolate chess pie that. Stacy Thompson sent me. And it's such an easy, easy pie. Course chess pies are easy anyway. And the only difference in a. regular chess and a chocolate is you just have to melt your chocolate. So, and I am using a. store bought pie crust. And you know, it, this. just works well in my life. It cuts a lot. (dog toy squeaking) of time out and one of the dogs. had found their noisy toys. So if you hear a lot of squeaking, it's not Theresa down there crying. (laughing) Listen, Max is... - [Theresa] Give me that toy! - Max is crazy. When he gets a toy. y'all he won't share it. - [Eddie] He's already back around. (laughing) - Hey Max, hey buddy. And listen. When the other dogs have a toy, like when my children's dogs come over and they may have a toy with. them, Max will get their toy. He'll run, take it off.. And then he'll pee on it. And then he keeps it like, no, you're not getting. my toy back. This is my toy. Gimme that toy, Max.. - [Eddie] Max has issues. - Gimme that toy, Max. Gimme that toy, gimme that toy. Gimme that toy. Gimme that toy.. (laughing) Oh my gosh. They have a lot of fun. Okay back to our pie.. (dog toys squeaking) So I have three eggs that are unbeaten and I am just gonna, and Stacy says to just use the hand mixer on this recipe and, and in goes her sugar. And remember it calls for one and a fourth cup of sugar, I. think in the original recipe. But Stacy took hers down to one cup. So I'm doing this just like Stacy. So remember if this pie to your. tongue is not sweet enough, you're safe to go ahead. and add a fourth of a cup more of sugar. - [Eddie] She added that extra chocolate. Maybe that took care of it. - She added the extra chocolate. Yes. So she felt like she. had to take away something. Alrighty. Let's see. Next goes our carob syrup. How much is that supposed to be? Quarter of a cup. - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - Okay, I was thinking I had. seen three quarters of a cup and I'll give y'all a. little tip right here. We didn't do it, but it sure does help. If you'll spray your measuring cups with a nonstick spray before. you, before you put honey or syrup or anything. like that, it's sticky. It'll just cause it and flow right out. - [Theresa] See, you needed to a good tip. - Yes. - [Theresa] I was helping you out. - All right. (mixer whirring) Okay. So this is cooled down enough that we don't have to worry. about tempering our eggs. So in goes a melted. chocolate and our butter. And this is smelling wonderful. - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. - [Paula] Doesn't it smell good, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - Yum yum, whoa. Get every drop out. And then I think it calls. for like a half a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. I'm trying to put a teaspoon 'cause I like vanilla flavoring. And the recipe Stacy tells us to put this in a preheated oven,. preheated to 375 degrees. But now, you know your oven. better than we know it. So use your own judgment on whether you want to stay at 350 or 375. I'm actually starting this one out at 350, - [Theresa] But you're gonna be-- - Yeah, but I've also flipped. this oven to convection so that will make up. So that is it, I spend. a lot of time talking. If I hadn't have been talking we could have made this. pie in like two minutes. Really. This reminds me a little bit of our chocolate, gooey butter cakes. The way it smells. - [Theresa] This has got Eddie's. name written all over it. - [Paula] All over it.. - [Eddie] It does, doesn't it. - [Theresa] I almost, I told. him I almost had to make two. And he was like, well,. there's never enough chess pie in the house.. - [Paula] Uh uh, uh uh. - [Theresa] I think he's. a little disappointed that we only got the one. - Between Eddie and Michael and me. (phone ringing) Excuse me. Let me look at the phone. It may be, it is, hello? - [Man On Speaker] Yes (indistinct) - Thank you. (beeping). (dogs barking) Okay. Excuse me y'all. - [Theresa] I was going to say. you don't ever leave anything in the bowl. - I'm trying to get it all y'all. I want us to have every bite. - [Theresa] Eddie was hoping you were going to leave a little bit. for him to lick a spoon. - [Paula] Oh he was? Oh okay, then maybe I won't get. that little bit right there. Maybe I'll just leave it. Okay there, Eddie. - [Eddie] She ain't kidding. - [Theresa] I'm not kidding.. (laughing) - No honey.. (dog barking) What? Do we have company? Do we have company? Alright. Stacy also says she. recommends cooking it on a on a baking sheet. So it just makes it easier. when you go to get it out of the oven. And I totally agree with her. I dripped a little chocolate on the crust. But I think it's okay.. (dogs barking) So she tells us to bake it. uncovered for 30 minutes. Oh my gosh. Theresa turned on the oven,. but she didn't put it to temp. So I don't know. I maybe should take it out. Yeah. I thought Theresa turned it. - [Theresa] I did turn it on, didn't I? - It wasn't on, it was on 200. - [Eddie] Is this oven on? No?. - No. This one was turned on,. but it was just turned on at 200 degrees, you. know, where (laughing). - [Theresa] Your markings. are a little funny on that. - That is oh.... - [Theresa] Fancy oven. - That is okay, Theresa. - [Theresa] We fixed it? - Yes. That is an easy fix. If that's the worst thing. that goes wrong today we are doing good sister. - [Eddie] It just means chocolate pie ten minutes later. - Yes. And Stacy said it's fabulous. with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and a little. chocolate drizzle over it. - [Theresa] Well, we'll. be back to show 'em. - Yes, we will. And I came out with a. hand sanitizer y'all. I take it on to Shop HQ and I enjoy, enjoying using. it in the kitchen rather than having to walk off and. wash my hands every few seconds. This way, I feel like I'm, I'm clean. (dishes clinking). (dog toy squeaking) Just makes me feel better. I got to stay clean for. all these grandchildren that we've got. So that's it. We're going to bake it for 30 minutes. And then Stacy said every. five minutes, look at it and determine. She said it needs to jiggle. just a little, which sounds like our gooey butter cakes. We want to jiggle just a. little bit, but not much. So Eddie, you'll be eating. pie in 30 minutes baby, or maybe 35 or maybe 40. Okay. Y'all. Stacy Thompson's chocolate. chess pie is ready. Hopefully it's cool enough for me to cut. And you know, I told John that we used a frozen pie crust, so, oh my gosh. And she said, leave it a little jiggly. You know, when you take it out. of the oven and I have shared with y'all how I get that first. piece of pie out of the pan. You know, it's, if you're. gonna mess up one piece and be able to get to the rest of the pie. Well, I take my scissors and I snip. Oh, there went the crust. I snip where I have indicated. where my piece of pie what size my piece of pie is going to be. And then you just want to take that down, pull that down. And it makes it so much easier. to get that first piece out. Oh, I didn't get all that. I left some I didn't mean to. There you go. I'm not, I'm not missing any of it. Wow. Oh gosh. My glasses won't stay up on my nose. I'm starting to sweat. Gosh, I wish I could give you. chocolate baby, but I can't. I just can't. It's not good for you. Pie and ice cream. Many, many pies scream for ice cream. Or fresh whipped cream. Now, I've got ice cream but I don't have any fresh whipped cream. So I'm going to cheat. I think this was bought for my grandchildren. when they were over here you know, and going to make something. So, and I am so hungry. Stacy girl. That is some more ever good. Stacy Thompson's chocolate chess pie. - [Eddie] The handful of extra chocolate makes the difference. - Yes, but you know what? Stacy cut the sugar by a fourth of a cup. - [Theresa] You would've kept it. - I would've kept it. (laughing) Because chocolate is really not sweet. It's bitter. So if y'all make it every. tongue's different though. Look at this. You know, when I was on that Food Channel they tried to teach me. how to take princess bites but I didn't know how I've never been a princess. So I didn't know what a princess bite was. Thank you, Stacy. Thank you so much for sharing that recipe. And I want to thank the Angus Barn in Raleigh, North Carolina,. for sharing this recipe with you so you could share it with us. So thank you darling. I appreciate it. And I'm sending everybody. love and our best dishes.
