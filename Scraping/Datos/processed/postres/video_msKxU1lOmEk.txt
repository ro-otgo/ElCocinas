- Hey, y'all! Happy whatever day it is. (giggles) I think this is a Wednesday, right, Eddie? (laughs). I don't know. (in background). - It's Wednesday, yes. (chuckles) - Anyway, I hope y'all. are having a good day and I am so happy that. you've joined us here in not my kitchen, but Bobby's kitchen. Look, I'm already getting. butter all over me. Oh, I forgot I had it on my spatula. So, I'm fixing to share. with y'all a recipe that was given to me by. a very special friend. Her name was Maggie. Her name is Maggie. And the name of this is. Maggie's Decadent Brownies. So I've got 4-ounces of chocolate in here along with two sticks of butter. So, Maggie tells us right off. the bat, this is decadent. So, I'm going to put it in a microwave. And she says, to microwave. it for three minutes. So, let's see what else. they tell us to do. She tells us after three. minutes in there to make sure the chocolate. is completely melted. And we're gonna to add the eggs, and 2-cups of sugar, and a. teaspoon of vanilla extract. (coughs) This is decadent, y'all. - It already smells decadent. - I know it smells decadent,. dunnit? And I wouldn't-- I wouldn't expect anything. less from Ms. Hart. Okay. Now, I added this. sugar first because I-- Ouch, it's so hot I didn't. want it to cook our eggs. So, in goes our vanilla. So, we're going to add our eggs one at a time. Oh, a double yolk! You don't see the double yolk? Kinda like a bathing suit--. suit top, doesn't it? The top to a bikini.. (chuckles) I love that! You know, we don't get many double yolks from eggs that we buy. from the supermarket. Very, very seldom. But when I had my chicken. coop, and look, they're like Siamese twins, Eddie, they're-- (chuckles) they're actually joining a-- they're adjoined. Okay. So, but I used to. get a lot of double yolks when I had my chicken coop and I can't wait for us to get into Dogwood because I'm. going to get my chickens back. I'm gonna have me a chicken coop if I have to go out there. myself and string up some-- some wire. (chuckles) to keep 'em in, cause the raccoons will sure come get 'em, you know, if you don't. find a way to protect them. All right, so, I'm gonna. get a fork so I can beat those eggs a little bit (clatter). Uh, oh. Oh, oh. Butt-shot. You missed it, Eddie. - I didn't get it. - You missed the butt-shot. Okay. I can't get over... I've never seen the double yolk that was actually joined. together, like that. Can't even beat it up. Okay. So, I just want to make sure that-- that chocolate and sugar. won't turn this stuff, scrambled eggs. No, it's all right. It had cooled down enough. Okay. So, we just want to incorporate our eggs in that batter really well. So, somebody told me yesterday, Eddie and I were out running--. running errands. Look at that, that's-- I think that's from that double yolk. And I said, I couldn't hardly. wait to get in our house because I definitely wanted. to take everybody on a tour, to show them what we've been. doing for the last six months. And somebody said to me, "Oh, I'm so happy to know that. You need to do a room a day." And I said, "that's. such a wonderful idea." Because it would be hard, the video would really be. long, wouldn't it, Eddie? To try to give a tour of the whole thing? - Well, depends on how fast--. - On what? - How fast we walk. - You know I ain't walking fast. (laughs) You know I'm not walking fast. Okay. So, now that's well incorporated. Let's see what they tell us to do next. Oh, okay. We added the sugar, the-- beaten eggs, a teaspoon of vanilla, and now we gonna add the flour and stir to combined,. spread the battery evenly in the prepared pan and. bake for 25 minutes. Okay. So, this is our flour and it-- it is all purpose flour. - Not a lot of flour. - No, lotta sugar though.. (laughs) Yeah, that-- that works a little better. All right, now, it said a prepared pan. So, that tells you that. it needs to be sprayed with something non-stick. But what I did, when I unwrapped. my two sticks of butter, I just took the paper that the butter was in, and I used it to grease my pan. And that worked out perfect, cause I had two sticks of butter and two sheets of like the. wax paper, that it comes in. Now, the thing I do like about Margaret Jo's recipe is I hadn't had-- I have not had to pull out a mixer yet. Okay. So, we're putting this. in the oven for 45 minutes-- for 25 minutes. And I. will see y'all back then. Okie-dokie, the brownies are almost ready to come out of the oven. Maggie's decadent brownies. And now, we gonna make the. frost and it goes on 'em, y'all. And I have to say, I've been talked about a lot cause of the butter I use, but do y'all realize that. Maggie's decadent brownies has one pack a butter in it? It's got four sticks of. butter. You go, girl! (laughs) So, for the frosting, we're gonna melt four 1-ounce blocks of cheese, - Of chocolate.. - and it's-- Not cheese. (laughs) I think I'm thinking. a cream cheese, maybe? This is unsweetened. chocolate, right, Teresa,? - Yes, ma'am.. - That you have up here? - Yes, ma'am. - And then we've got. our two sticks of butter and Maggie tells us, because this frosting. really doesn't get cooked. She tells us, to use that. pasteurized egg substitute. Am I correct, Teresa?. - Yes, ma'am. - When I say that?. - That is correct. - But I don't have any of that. You know what?. - I say we leave it out. - I don't think I'm gonna put eggs in it. The eggs would help bind it together. But rather than me using. my raw eggs that I have, I just don't want to chance. getting anybody sick, you know, with them. - And we are going to eat these. - Yes. They gonna make me eat it, y'all. Theresa said that I had to eat some. - And Eddie and Theresa.. (laughs) - All right. So, let's see. I think she'd probably tells. us this for three minutes again she had a us warm this. Let's see. Three minutes. Yup. It's actually the same amount. that we used for the brownies. We're gonna make sure you do whatever you need to do, Theresa. - I'm gonna bring it over here for you, so it's a little easier.. - Oh, thank you. Yes, because we're going to. pour this frosting on them while they're warm. All right. That's one pound of-- (laughs) Everybody get in the picture here. You just go, Maggie. I'm telling ya. - Yeah. I mean it's pretty. much pure sugar and butter. - Yes. Yes. All right. Well, this is going. to be really, really stiff and I don't think it, the eggs. would do that. Do you, Eddie? I'm gonna add my vanilla flavoring. Give it a little moisture. - So, do you remember her ever baking-- - No. No, I don't. I'm sure she did though. When she was at home, but being our teacher,. you know, we didn't have-- I know some of the girls. used to hang out with her. Some of the kids that were. ahead of us, you know, like if I was a sophomore or junior, there was some senior girls. and girls below us that were really, like Susan, like Bubbles. She was five years-- She is five years younger than me. So, her class got real. close with Margaret Jo. Like I said, she just had. a lot in common with us being not much older than us. You know what, I think-- I think I'm gonna have to put. this back in the microwave, Eddie. - How much egg substitute. was supposed to go in there? - Like a fourth of a. cup, something like that, - So--. - Half a cup. So, that-- that actually didn't get very hot at the end of the three minutes. The butter and the chocolate. wasn't all that hot, so. And I may wind up having to. add a little cream to it. But it's okay. Okay. So, that was the. end of an extra minute. So, let's see what we got.. Yeah. Yeah. It needed just a. little-- little bump. And I am gonna add just a little cream. To make up from us not having the liquid of the pasteurized eggs. That looks pretty darn. good, doesn't it, Eddie? (laughs) You smiling hard, Eddie?. - Yeah, it smells good. (laughs) - Wow. If this doesn't satisfy. your sweet tooth, y'all, I don't think it can be satisfied. (chuckles) Wow. Yeah, that little bump in. the microwave helped it. It just didn't get hot enough. those first three minutes There is not a better word,. for this, than decadent. Taste, Eddie. - Okay, the kitty cat. is like harassing me. - Oh, she is? - She keeps scratching.. - She's grabbing your cord. - She's grabbing my. cord, my leg, everything. - For good reason. Looks so good. And it's chewy. (joyfully exclaims) - Yum! That's like eating fudge outta-- - Oh, it is. It's like. eating a chocolate cake, chocolate pancake in fudge. - I wanna tell, y'all what kind of person Margaret Joe Hart was. She and Bubbles would come over when I first started the bag lady, and they would help me, they. would go to the grocery store, and find my groceries for me. Because they knew, you know, the only money I had was. whatever the children brought in from that day's revenue. And, so, it went on for a. year and a half that away. And-- Kenny, who's a friend of. mine, called and said, Paula the Best Western kitchen is empty. And he said, you really. need to go down there and try to get that space. So, I did. And naturally at night I wanted. to be able to cook steaks and, you know, I had no way to cook them. So, Maggie and Bubbles. was over here one time, and I said, you know,. showing them all around, I said, you know, we should add a grill, you know, so, I can grill steaks. And Maggie said, well, Paula, I've got one that was in the Oglethorpe. Her mother and father owned. Oglethorpe hotel/motel, And Oglethorpe restaurant where. a lotta people went to eat, - Wow. - And she said, I'm gonna bring you over the. one that was in our restaurant. And she said, I want you to have a grill. So, the next time they came, honey, they came loading up that gas grill and put it in my kitchen. So, that's the kind of people that I've been around all of my. life. You know, good people. And-- so, that sums it up, what kind of person Margaret Jo was. So, I send you, honey, love. and best dishes, today. And thank you for everything. that you ever did for me. And especially for this. wonderful, wonderful recipe. (giggles)
