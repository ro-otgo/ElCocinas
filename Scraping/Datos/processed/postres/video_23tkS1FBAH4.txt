well we've gotten our turkeys taken care of they're all settled and waiting to be cooked but before we get started with those I'm gonna go ahead and start on our dessert which is called gooey butter cake and you're gonna love this recipe it's so easy and simple to make and once you taste it you'll never ever want pumpkin pie again we're going to simply start with a yellow cake mix and you can just use the brand of your choice along with one stick of melted butter and to that we're going to add one egg now you can't hardly get much simpler than that and this is going to be our crust we're gonna just beat this until all the cake is mixed and moist all right we're ready now so we're gonna just ease that up and kind of spin that off of our beaters as you can see our crust to our gooey butter cake is very very thick that's why I normally just stick it in a mixer and get done with it now all we're gonna do at this point is take our crust and lay it into our greased prepared pan and to make the spreading of my face a little easier I'm just gonna rub my hands in the pot that I had the butter in and I'm just gonna grease them up a little bit you know when I started making these wonderful little gooeys I just used a very basic recipe of cake mix and eggs and cream cheese but after a while I got bored making them that way so I got into the kitchen and I just played around and tested and I bet you at this point we probably make 50 different gooey butter cakes now we're gonna move to our cream cheese filling and I'm not even gonna bother washing this mixer we can use it just like it is you can make your gooeys the morning or the day before I really prefer a fresh gooey that was just out of the oven the day of Thanksgiving and you don't even have to refrigerate these which is even nicer we're going to start with our cream cheese and our powdered sugar and we're just gonna beat these two things together until they're fluffy really is so simple and then we're going to slowly add another stick of butter and remember this is called gooey butter cake so we're going to add three eggs to the center we're gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring getting there at this point now we are at our original gooey butter cake recipe now is when we're going to make our changes today because it's Thanksgiving we're going to make pumpkin and I'm using just a regular canned pumpkin and we're going to just fold this into our cream cheese and because this doesn't have any of your flavorings I'm gonna add a little ground cinnamon and a little nutmeg now I go lighter on the nutmeg than I do the cinnamon because it's really a potent seasoning and so at this point this is when you change your flavorings if you wanted to do blueberry or if you wanted to do peanut butter if you wanted to do cherry peaches whatever you want to do but as I told you this pumpkin is just perfect for Thanksgiving and look how wonderful see you getting your pumpkin e color now so all we do now at this point is pour it onto our crust in about 45 minutes we're gonna have the most wonderful pumpkin dessert you've ever put in your mouth and we're ready to go into the oven our cooking time is up now and our gooey butter cakes and they should be ready and they are they look just perfect now normally I would let these cool for about 20 or 30 minutes but I can't stand it I'm gonna go ahead and cut them now cuz I want y'all to see them I'm gonna just slice this and I love to eat and I can't eat a real big piece so cut them to suit your preference and these down here a little bit bigger so we'll give this into the men and I tell y'all before I put them on the platter I don't think anybody all know if I just sneak one real quick light so I've just got to taste it because it's been a while since I've had the pumpkin but look look look at that beautiful beautiful warm gooey pumpkin and I always top mine with a little fresh sweetened whipped cream and if you like when you go to serve it you can also just sprinkle it with a little cinnamon just dust your plate I don't think anybody all notice if one little tiny piece is missing it really is Thanksgiving
