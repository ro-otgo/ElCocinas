So you're welcome to put it on. - Okay. - You might just can't turn. it on cause of the sound. - Okay. Okay. (both laughing) And if I have a flash, I'll. have to borrow it from you. - Okay. We'll share it. How about that? We'll share it. - Okay, so get going, girl. - All right. So we are gonna do the peanut butter bars. Some people call 'em old school, Old Fashioned. Peanut Butter Bars. Are they either call 'em Nutty Buddy Bars. - Nutty Buddy, yeah, they. taste like a nutty buddy, don't they? - Yes, yes, yes they do. So the first thing we're gonna. do is take our ingredients. We have two cups of sugar. We have two cups of self-rising flour. We have two cups of oatmeal. We have two eggs and one. cup of creamy peanut butter, things that you can find in your cabinet all day long. - You're so good. I kind of forget to tell my ingredients. (laughing) - So we'll start with the oatmeal and we mix it all in the same bowl. - Love it. A one bowl. - Yes. - One bowl wonder. - Yes, one bowl wonder. Nice and quick. So there's no special way. We also do two cups of, we do two cups of, two sticks of butter. Two sticks of melted butter. That's it. That's it, Paula. - See, I told y'all she was my soul. (Q laughing) - So I'm getting it all in here. All right. - So who rode with you today from Albany? - I have my dear friend that. rode with me from Albany, little Shakka, Barney Pate.. - Shakkakan. ( all laughing) - So I'm so thankful that she was able to come with me today. - I know that you were. - Yes. - That's got to be the most boring drive. - It is, yes. Oh my gosh, it is. - You think you're never. gonna get off of 16. - I know it. And luckily that's what. she likes to drive. So guess what? She was a great help. - Oh, so you drove, Shakka? - And then my two stick. (audio drops) - Do you know that margarine, this is what I hear, margarine was first invented to use on automobiles and things like that. - Oh no, I did not. - On machinery. - Oh wow. - And they finally found a. way for us to consume it. So, you know, I said, "God made the cow "and the cow made the butter. and stick with the real thing." - [Q] Yeah, stick with the real thing. - [Paula] Stick with he real thing. - [Q] I use a pure butter,. real butter on everything. - Absolutely - I do, so I'm just... - Some people like margarine, but I recommend that you stay away from it maybe. - I do too. So I'm folding this. - Yes, you are. - It's very simple. Very, very simple, very quick.. - And this doesn't need any spay? - [Q] No spray, we've got... - [Paula] Because of the butter? - [Q] Yes, the butter. We got lots of butter. - [Paula] All right, well. I'm gonna be your sous chef and your cleaner upper. - [Q] All right. So we gonna fold this in and then we are gonna get it ready to go. - That's what I meant to ask you. I'm gonna cut the oven on. What do you bake it on? - We bake it on 325. - 325. - Yes. - [Paula] Well, I'm gonna. get our oven to going. - Okay and now I've got it folded. I'll put it into the pan. Do not spray your pan with these. Do not. You will mess up the. entire recipe if you do. I've done it before, y'all. (laughing) - Cause I believe in. those sprays, you know? - Yes. - [Paula] I've had some disasters. - So I'm just spreading it evenly. And we're gonna pop it in the oven. - [Paula] Q, - [Q] Yes. - [Paula] In case people missed our video, our conversation video? - Um hm. - [Paula] Tell everybody. about your YouTube. - Oh yeah. You all can find me on... - [Paula] It's new thing. that she just started, y'all. - Yes, "Mixing It Up With Ms. Q." And it's a combination of recipes, great talk and inspirational conversations that I have with my audience. - [Paula] Kind of like therapy, isn't it? - It is, it really is. So you don't wanna miss it. I'm sure someone you. know, if not yourself, can use some of that great. information that I give. I also added resources. If you need a second chance, you've had some struggles with. getting on track with life, you can get some resources off my YouTube, "Mixing It Up With Ms. Q." I did a pink table and I. offered a lot of resources after at the end of the pink table. So go and watch us, on "Mixing It Up With Ms. Q.". - Is that done in the bakery, Q? - Actually it is, it is, yes. So we're gonna put this in. the oven for 25 minutes. - [Paula] Okay.

The eggs.. - Well, most people, yes. - Most people that come and they say, "What do you have healthy?" And they say,. (Paula laughing) "Oh, it has peanut butter and oatmeal. "I'll try that." (Paula laughing) We're not gonna talk about the chocolate that goes on top of it once it's done. - Oh, oh, oh chocolate. - Yeah. (laughing) - Yay. (both laughing) - All right. So we're gonna start with our chocolate. - Yes, while our oatmeal bars, peanut butter oatmeal bars are baking, Q is gonna make the. chocolate icing to go on 'em. - Yes, yes, yes. So we're gonna start with. like a half cup of milk, and we're gonna pour it in the saucer. We gotta turn it on first, don't we? - [Paula] Actually that's heavy cream. - Heavy cream, yes. I love heavy cream. So I would do heavy cream. opposed to regular milk. - [Paula] Yeah. - Okay. - Or half and half - Or half and half. You can do half and half. - Yes. - Yes you can. - But ain't nothing like that, y'all. - I call heavy cream my secret weapon. I just love it.. (Paula laughing) I just love it. So we got about three cups. of powdered sugar here and we gonna add it into the heavy cream. Just making us some good old fashioned, homemade chocolate icing. - [Paula] Yeah, so simple, isn't it? - Yes, very simple. - When does your butter come in? - The butter is coming up next after this, so we're gonna go ahead. and add some cocoa. - [Paula] Do you need a whisk? - Yes, I do.

I think it'll finish. melting in your chocolate. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - This is perfect. - It's an honor to be your sous chef. - Well, I thank you. I'm gonna add a little vanilla. - [Paula] That's good. old homemade vanilla. - I see. I want this y'all. Paula got everything. (Paula laughing) She's got everything, I'm telling y'all. - We made this almost. a year ago, didn't we? - Wow. Y'all gotta help me talk her into taking some of that to the bakery. I bet y'all will like that, huh? - Yes, and you know for it. to really be good though, Q, it needs to sit for a couple of months. That's the only thing.. - Really? Yes, you get. - Oh wow. the vanilla beans and. slice 'em and then scrape all the goody off of 'em. - Oh wow. I'm gonna add the rest of this. - With your vodka? - Oh yeah. - Bourbon. - Or Bourbon. - [Paula] Yes. That's the only thing. You can't wait until you're out. - [Q] Right, you gotta make it, yeah, because it has to sit. and marinate for so long. All right. So we're about finished. with our chocolate icing. It's looking really good. - Um, um, um. That is chocolate-ate. - Yes. At its absolute best. (Paula laugh) I love it. - All right. That you get it thin enough, so you just pour it. - Pour it. Yes, it's a pour. Yes.. - Okay. The good old fashioned grandma icing. - Yes, I was gonna say,. it's more like an icing than a frosting, right? - Yes. Yes it is. All right. So we've got our peanut. butter bars out of the oven. Just pay attention to the color. We don't want 'em that dark, 'cause we want keep the moistness in 'em and we gonna bring them over here, where Paula is, and we're just gonna pour the chocolate that has been made.. - I tested your chocolate to make sure it was good enough for you. (laughing) - So what'd you think? - I think it's good enough for you. You do think it's good enough? - Yes. - All right. all right. So we're gonna pour it on top and Paula's gonna spread while I pour. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Q] Yes. - [Paula] Oh my goodness, Q. - [Q] Yes. - Oh, I forgot it was so hot.

By all means.. - Every drop. Yes. Get it. Perfect. - You know you can tell. I'm from the old school. I get every drop out. - Every drop that's me. They laugh at the bakery. (speaking over one another) cause they say, "Ms. Q is gonna get you "if you throw some of that away." - I'm telling you what. - We want every drop - Every drop. And I'd watch the kitchen. staff like a hawk, to make sure they wasted nothing.. - Nothing. - [Q] That's it. That is it. - I told them one day, (chuckling) I used this as an example and I think it made it clear for 'em, you know, what I was saying, but I said, "I want. y'all to think about this "because this does have. something to do with y'all. "All right, you think. about this container, "this dish of dessert. "And I want you to think. about it this way." I'm gonna wait for you. to come back over here. - [Q] Okay. - 'Cause I think it's a great. way to get away the, okay. So you think about, I asked them to think. about this pan of desserts. All right, this third of it. - [Q] Don't touch it. (Paula chuckles) - [Paula] This third of it. pays for the ingredients. This third pays your salary. And this part is a profit. for the restaurant. And it's very important that you don't throw the. restaurants profit away. - That's good. - 'Cause you need all of that. - All of that to make one. Perfect. That's perfect. I like it. I like it. So I want you to taste it.. - They understood. - They understood. - Oh good. Very good.. - It was clearer to 'em when I could involve. - When you did like that. their paycheck. - Exactly. I do a lot of that at the. bakery with customer service. Just telling them how. important the customers are. If you you treat them good,. - They're everything. and you show great customer service, they'll keep coming back and. we can keep the doors open and then I can pay you more. The more the customers,. the more you can get paid, the more the company can make. - That's exactly right. - I always telling 'em,. let's just keep that in mind. - I'm telling you. I've been in some businesses. queue where you walk in and that person in that business acts like they are doing me a favor.. - Favor. What's up with that? - I don't know. It's horrible. - [Paula] Oh gosh. Look at this. I don't know how big you cut. these in the restaurant, but. - [Q] You just cut a little. small piece so you can taste it. I just want you to taste it. - [Paula] Well, I could. have gotten four out of that but we'll get, we'll get three. I hope it'll come out. with it being so hot. - If you get a strong enough spatula I know how to get it out.. - Yeah, that's what That middle one right there.. I'm looking for. - Well, this one, this one. is my grandmother's spatula. I've got one that's not quite as wide that my Aunt Peggy gave me but this was my grandmother's spatula in her restaurant at River. Bend when I was little. - Really? - Yes. - Wow. - And it's got the date on it. It's got USA 1945. Oh dear, that's sweet.. - Two years before I was born. Oh that's sweet. - Yes.

It's not your fault. I should have read the directions right the first time. (Paula and Q laughing) - [Paula] So this is warm. Keep in mind. It'll cut much better after school. Whoa. - Trying to hold it together. - Yes. Like I said after it cools. - After it cools. - It'll be fine. But you know what? A nice warm bite of something sweet is pretty good. - Yes. - It's real, real hot. - (chuckling) You like it? - Um hm. You taste the peanut butter,. a homemade chocolate. - How did you put that. in your mouth, honey? It's hot. - Gotta blow. (laughing) - It's so good. (laughing) (blowing) Um, um. Um. (laughing) - It's really good. - It is so good. That oatmeal and the chocolate. - See, the chocolate is, yeah, is not too sweet.
