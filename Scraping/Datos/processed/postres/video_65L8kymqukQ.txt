hey y'all come on in the house you know I know it's a little early but I'm already planning on some of the desserts that I'm gonna make for the 4th of July celebration and I think this one is perfect and you can find the recipe in my issue of cooking with Paula Deen magazine it's there's a beautiful picture in there so you can see what we have in mind when we were putting the recipe together but this is real simple it's one of those recipes that you just gonna love to keep in your little recipe box and you know I was talking about convenience products that you can find now this is a very good convenience product it is a no bake cheesecake filling and it tastes just like cheesecake and this is in your dairy section right Theresa is it with the egg cream cheese bags and the cream cheese yes all right so we're using two of those and these are gosh I don't see the size on me and I know it's got to be there young it probably comes in just one size it does Oh net weight twenty four point three ounces all right now I'm gonna take our cheesecake filling into that I'm gonna add some lemon curd so this is just gonna make it give it a lemony fresh cool taste and somehow lemon just tastes so good in hot weather I don't know why all right I used a fourth of a cup of lemon curd so I'm just gonna mix that in and if you wanted it more lemony you could you could add more curd to it it looks so good looks like a white cloud that you just could dive into it's so hot outside you're so hot just dive into a cloud of coolness okay now I've got my trifle bow you'll need like a three and a half quart and I'm gonna start by putting two and one-third cup on the bottom layer and I love love my measuring cups these are so good what I'm doing right now I use them all the time when I'm loading my cake pans up with cake batter because I can make sure they are gonna be perfectly even all right so we're just gonna press that down and around until we've coated the bottom oh you know what I can do maybe I've got a magazine over there I think that this recipe was in do I not Theresa do I have the magazine I do not we don't have it here I do not actually it's coming out it is it is the recipe it has been in one of our other magazine okay all right now I'm gonna add two cups of crushed vanilla wafers so I use these a lot yeah I mean coming in here maybe three sets all right this is crushed up vanilla wafers and I'm just gonna sprinkle 2 cups of a no-bake dessert you're in the hottest months of the year okay okay next is strawberries or raspberries blackberries and blueberries alright I'm going to divide the fruit into two cups each layer gets two cups so raspberries are a soft little fruit okay so that's one cup okay and then we're gonna go to our blues and take out one more cup so this will be two cups of fruit that we've used how's that looking Teresa hmm they look good you know and this is almost well I don't know if it's healthy healthy but it's a great way to get the kids to eat their fruit don't you don't you agree all right we're gonna come back in now with another layer your cheesecake dollop that on top then I'm trying to spread it around with now disturbing the berries too much okay that's one cup sails columns that's all I did sounds calm to begin Salam okay so we're gonna have to very gently spread that cheesecake filling over our fruit oh gosh it's looking pretty you know people are gonna think you worked very very hard on this recipe and it's so easy all you have to do is spray it spray it spray it and everybody loves cheese take that back who doesn't love cheesecake okay and I need another third of a cup all right now I'm just gonna take the paper towel and try to clean up right there right there and right there outside the bubble where was touching it that looks pretty good look for the plane too young okie-dokie all right two more cups of crumbs [Music] okie-dokie that's pretty okay we added two more cups of the crushed vanilla wafers and now we're adding two cups more of our fruit and this looks so good or save a few for the time okay now comes in I believe I blew blackberries okay and now our blueberries love it a lot in this cloudy it looks good you know the fourth of July is such a fun day to spend with your family and friends and you want it to be easy so you can do this the night before and then just pull it out and you're all ready to celebrate alright so the next thing that goes on oh no one second okay sorry about that all right so in goes our cheesecake topping on top of all that wonderful fresh fruit you know and you know by all means use your favorite fruit if you don't like blackberries for some reason then you don't have to use them you can use all blueberries but what we want to do since this is a fourth of July cake is make sure we got our red white and blue how are you you are just in terms on guess what are we with everybody we're with everybody everybody should be jealous this is our fourth of July son thanks it looks like the fourth of July I know it's red white and blue almost could stand some more cheesecake feelings but well is this the sampler no no you'll get the sampling tomorrow yeah can I help I don't think so son I'm I'm just having to delicately you know the Cheesecake Denton room yeah that's hard yeah for sure yeah so tell me what I'm looking at you're looking at cuz it looks like a trifle you are looking at yeah lemon very drunk yeah we're dirty trifle because the reason the lemon has worked in on it is because the cheesecake filling has lemon curd mm-hmm so it gives it that just a little light clean oh it's gonna be so good you know who's gonna love that me well besides you you everybody your baby yeah they will love it yes so what do you do you put this in the refrigerator oh yes yes so see I'm getting all the work done today yeah Bobby uh-huh and then tomorrow you can just have fun I'm just having fun that's the way I'm just gonna have fun smaller planet yes and I'm just gonna clean this up a little bit where I got some what goes on top could you like shave some lemon zest on top of that or something there's some color what would you do well maybe sweet mint sprigs Oh anything personally what I like on top is my two layups you still alright so here's what we're gonna do the Crone's this is this is banana yes vanilla wafers like some people use on banana pudding and then we're just gonna put our fruit on top but I don't think I'm gonna do that yet I think I think I may wait put it in the refrigerator at this point yawn and then tomorrow just put my fruit on top of it don't you think so or should I do it named jealousy you know what this is partly because I've got a talk about me for a second let's talk about you you got an event coming up for um for the pool's foundation I've got Albert who votes in his wife for precious be beautiful people with an inner Francis moppy's great foundation for for families and for children with special children and so anyhow they they were asking me about the menu that I'm gonna do that we're gonna do together because I've roped you into it oh they're very excited but you're gonna be a part of it oh good it's been a while since I've seen them and they are just lovely they're wonderful they asked me for a truck assistance no they asked me if I would do a trifle dessert and have it just ready and when are we gonna do this we're gonna do it soon I'll tell you I've already got okay can I put this in the refrigerator and save it till that day well I won't be honest if you put that in the refrigerator in this house I don't think he's gonna make it till tomorrow's named yeah you think it's my baby and it looks right that's photo worthy now nobody starts up on you do them no that's what we do that's what they do when the leaf falls oh how beautiful is that okay y'all this is a beautiful desert just perfect for the summertime and Bobby want makes this a lemon trifle mm-hmm it's because I used a ready-made cheesecake filling that you can buy now I mean you can hear so many convenience foods out there but I put lemon zest into that so oh not lemon zest lemon tell you what you put in it okay cream cheese I know and that's lemon curd it gives it that fresh lemony little tart okay y'all that is Bobby Deen approved you know I trust this little palette and if he tells me
