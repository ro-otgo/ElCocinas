hey y'all i'm paula dean welcome to my kitchen i'm getting everything ready i'm gonna have a few friends in for a tea party so today i'm gonna be fixing the cutest little individual strawberry shortcakes and you're gonna love my gooey pecan squares and of course no tea parties complete without some scrumptious sour cream scones that we've topped off with a sweet raspberry fig preserve so y'all sit back it's a tea party y'all let's go ahead and get started i've got everything gathered here that we're gonna need to make the cake part of our strawberry shortcake and i'm gonna use two cups of all-purpose flour there we go just right into the bowl i'm gonna pour it to my flour i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of salt one tablespoon of baking powder three tablespoons of sugar now i'm gonna cut in one stick of very cold butter that i've cut up into pieces now you'll want to make sure that this is not at room temperature cause we don't want our butter to like melt into our flour we want it to be cut in so there's little chunks of butter all right so we're just gonna pulse this until we see that that butter is cut into that flour one more little faults all right there we go yeah that looks good almost looks like a little bit like cornmeal very quickly the food processors work great for that now i'm just going to transfer that to my bowl i'm gonna make a well and i'm gonna add two thirds a cup of half and half and just work that into my my buttery dough i remember when i was a young girl my mama would go to the grocery store and she would buy those little cakes the packages came like six had six shells for strawberry shortcake and oh man dude we love those but that was definitely the store-bought answer and there's nothing like the real old-timey sweet biscuit for strawberry shortcakes so i'm excited about making these today all right i've got all of our half and half mixed in now i'm just gonna take our spatula and i've got some flour up here on my counter and i'm just gonna put our dough into that flour and you can see that our dough is very very sticky so that little bit of flour is gonna give me just enough to kind of knead into that dough so i can touch it without it sticking to me and this is just perfect now i'm not even gonna have to roll this dough out i'm just gonna pat it out three quarters to an inch thick and you can see how easy and quick that was to get our shortcakes together a beautiful fat biscuit i'm just going to add this to the tray over here that i got going now you'll want to make sure when you're making your dough for your strawberry shortcake that you don't overwork your dough you want to just handle it as little as possible okey doke so i've got these on a cookie sheet now i want to just brush the tops with a little half and half and i'm doing that for two reasons the half and half will give a little sheen to our shortcakes plus i've got a little extra sugar for these bad boys and that half and half will give the sugar something to stick to you know this is a dessert so i want my biscuits to be sweet okay so we're gonna pop this in to a preheated oven at 400 degrees in they go and while those are baking i'm gonna come over here and i'm gonna finish up my strawberries i had gotten them started now i'm using like one quart of strawberries the larger ones i'm quartering the smaller strawberries i'm just cutting in half had a junior strawberry and a granddaddy strawberry there all right so into the bowl they go [Music] i'm gonna toss them with a fourth of a cup of sugar and that'll sugar will go into those strawberries and they're going to produce a nice juice i'm going to give these a quick stir so they can get to mixing with that sugar and when we come back i want to share with you a favorite recipe of ours down here in the south they're called pecan squares and it's going to be delicious along with our tea and then later sour cream scones with a raspberry fig preserve i so hope y'all are enjoying the show and if you do be sure to click like subscribe and the notification bell so you'll never miss a video and we'll be right back after the break [Music] hey y'all welcome back while we were on break i took the biscuits out of the oven and look how beautiful these little biscuit cakes look i'm gonna use a serrated knife so that they won't crumble on me look in here see that oh my goodness the girls are gonna love it um now i'm gonna come in here with my strawberries just kind of pile them up on there and now i'm gonna go in for that juice and now i'm gonna come back in here and put my lid on it put a few more strawberries on top of that and you can't have strawberry shortcake without some nice sweetened whipped cream can you and some of my beautiful mint from the garden look at that look at that beautiful shortcake just glistening y'all don't mind if i go ahead and taste do you i don't know what to say it's so delicious i know my girlfriends are gonna love it we'll move on down here because i want to start on the next dish and i said pecan squares now i've got four eggs here waiting to go into my bowl and i'm cracking those one at the time i'm gonna crack them first and drop them in this little small bowl so i can just give them the old eagle line make sure those birds were flying straight that day and so far so good they look great got a little bit of a shell there you know i don't know about your town but savannah has gotten some nice tea rooms and some tea shops here in the last few years and people are really into them especially women all right i've gotten my four eggs beaten now i'm gonna add a one pound box of light brown sugar the whole box goes in there and sometimes your brown sugar will clump up on you you know if you need to just take your whisk and go down in there and break up that brown sugar think that last chunk got them all so in our double boiler it goes so there we go we're gonna cook this for about 20 minutes or until it gets to 240 degrees now while that's cooking come on over here and we can be mixing up our dry ingredients for our pecan squares i'm going to measure out one and a half cups of all-purpose flour so that's a half and this is a full cup i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of baking powder there we go and i've got one and a half cups of chopped pecans that i'm gonna just toss that into our flour mixture there we go all right let's come back over here and give our pot a stir we'll stick our thermometer in and just kind of see where we're at okay so it's ready so i'm just gonna pour our eggs and brown sugar that's been cooking over our flour and our pecans and before you know it we're going to be snacking on fabulous pecan squares and i'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and then we're just gonna stir that up just like that just mix that until our flour is incorporated okey-doke that easy i'm just gonna pour that into our pan that i've buttered and floured okay i'm just gonna spread those out you can see because this is partially cooked kind of wants to be a little stubborn now we cooked our shortcakes at 400 degrees i've lowered my oven temperature to 350 so in they go 22 to 25 minutes and when we come back i'm going to be making some wonderful sour cream scones i hope y'all are enjoying the show and i want to hear from you tell me what recipes or videos you'd like to see me make by just leaving a short comment below now let's get back to the show y'all [Music] all right y'all that was a very very quick 22 minutes and our pecan squares are done now i'm gonna sit here and let them cool for a little bit and come on down here and i'm gonna make us some sour cream scones i'm gonna start with two cups of all-purpose flour just right in there y'all can y'all hear lady bird she's wanting me to come out there and talk to her all right three tablespoons of sugar this kind of sounds like our shortcakes that we did for the strawberry shortcake doesn't it it's a little different though two tablespoons of bacon powder one teaspoon of baking soda and that goes and a half a teaspoon of salt now i've got five tablespoons of real real cold butter and we're gonna cut that in until again it looks like about the consistency of cornmeal that looks good all right now i'm gonna add one cup or one eight ounce container of sour cream and to shake up our little prissy tea party i'm gonna pull out my egg separator that says more paula than prissy and i'm just gonna look at that y'all i just love it i know you kids out there love it too mom and daddy may think it's sickening but i just love it it's very very important that we take time to laugh and have fun and that's definitely one of those things that just makes me laugh all right so let's mix this together you can see our dough is starting to form a ball in there all right there we go now i'm gonna bring this out onto my cutting board and i'm gonna put a little flour up here because once the ingredients got mixed together it became very soft again okay so i'm gonna just take my spatula and get the rest of that out okay oh and this looks very good now i'm just going to pat this out about one inch thick kind of pat it into a square i'm going to come in here and i'm going to cut this into four squares and i'm gonna cut them diagonally one time giving us eight triangles okay that's great i'm gonna come over here and i'm gonna get my grandmother's spatula and just transfer those to my baking sheet just like that the dough is beautiful isn't it [Music] okie doke last one on and i'm gonna brush them with half and half because it's gonna give it that little bit of shine and instead of using regular sugar i'm gonna use a raw sugar it's so pretty to work with i'm just gonna sprinkle those tops of those scones with lots of that raw sugar [Music] all right so in the oven our scones go 350 degrees for about 12 to 14 minutes okay so the scones are in the oven about 12 to 14 minutes and i'm getting this tea party pulled together rather nicely y'all uh when we come back i'm gonna pull it all together our scones will be ready i'm gonna cut our pecan squares and coming up next is raspberry fig preserves the perfect topping for our scones i so hope you all are enjoying the show and if you do be sure to click like subscribe and the notification bell so you'll never miss a video

you what we can't serve a scone without something to smear on it can we and let me show you how easy we're going to put this together i've got three cups of mashed figs three cups of sugar and two
