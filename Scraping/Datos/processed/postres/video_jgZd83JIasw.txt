we are cooking nothing but thanksgiving desserts we're gonna start off with a cinnamon ripple sweet potato cake so why don't we get started sounds good now the first thing i'd like for you to do is drain our sweet potatoes i am gonna be beating up and creaming two sticks of butter bird and two cups of sugar okay while you're getting all of our dry ingredients ready how do you want these paula just mashed up good you can't hurt them all right so when you get those sweet potatoes made jay you can just measure out one cup and put it in that bowl okay and i'm gonna start creaming our butter and sugar together and i'm just gonna beat this until it's creamy fill it up a little bit more baby a little bit more uh-huh all the way to the top and then level it off sounds good so i'm going to do the dry ingredients here i'm going to start out with a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg one teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of ground cinnamon now i'm gonna add one egg at the time bird and one tablespoon of salt here and then i'm just going to mix this up jaybird do you ever get to cook at home you know i do more so now than i ever have um you know i see your girl well that's right you know i've always been the eater in the family until now but um we're cooking more and more which is uh is nice it's my refrigerator has more food in it now than it's had in two years okay so we're gonna do three cups of this all-purpose flour i'm gonna add the rest of my eggs this is my third egg now jaybird i've got going in i'm just gonna give a little beat after each egg okay all right this looks good so bird if you would um go ahead and just scoop those sweet potatoes and again that's one cup of sweet potatoes and look at that that was still warm and look what you're doing to that butter all right now you take that spatula and just go around the sides for me you got it might need to cut that down at least time am i going to slush yes we got it going on that's right tag team in it all right so i think that's enough so now i've got a 16 ounce carton of sour cream and i'm gonna add three fourths of a carton of this so i'm just going to eyeball it y'all and i'm going to beat beat beat all right jaybird if you would just take this um measuring spoon and just slowly add this to our cake okay let's bring that that would be great and i might need you to just take that spatula and go around the edge of the bowl so we can keep all that flour okay you ready for the other i am so paula out of all the thanksgivings that we've spent together what was your favorite well jaybird i did love those thanksgivings in statesboro i did too we had so much fun he is running crazy and i'm very upset that we don't do that anymore because i'm old enough now to play poker with y'all yo as soon as we walked in the back door we set up the poker table last thanksgiving was pretty dadgum good i cooked thanksgiving here i know the store was open that's right i'm usually stuck down there so i'm gonna have to take some time off this thanksgiving so i can spend it with the family you think maybe you can make a phone call for me i think i think i might know somebody so while you work on that are you ready for me to make the streusel yes please okay so i'm going to work on that down here i actually am going to take a half a cup of brown sugar half a cup of chopped pecans here add that in okay and last but not least we're just going to throw in a teaspoon of ground cinnamon all right now we have sprayed our bundt pan and i'm going to put half the batter in and then we're going to put your dry ingredients right in the middle [Music] do you like eating cake batter i do i could actually live on it all right jay bird so we're going to take your dry ingredients yes now all you have to do jaybird is just sprinkle that evenly okay over that batter and if you want to do it with your hands that's perfectly all right and you know this is gonna be so delicious with some fresh whipped cream i cannot wait i know i can't either we are doing i think there'll be enough left for anybody else by the time i don't know but you know what today we don't have to share all right so if you would just kind of rotate this bowl sure as i go there you go that makes it easier this is one of those beautiful old retro bowls from like the [Music] right over 60s i got it ready to go okay on 350 we're going to stick it in there for one hour okay and count the minutes and look i won't take my finger and rake that off so you can have that jaybird 350 degrees for one hour yes while you're stirring those i'm gonna come down here and i'm gonna finish up our cake uh i'm gonna make the glaze and how oh that's a heavy cake so how's this jay bird it's beautiful in this beautiful alakazabra alakazam i'll be damn i'm a poet and don't know it how's that that's beautiful magic yes it is magic cake magic all right now i'm gonna make a glaze for our cake i'm gonna use two cups of confectionary sugar [Music] a half a cup of heavy cream three-fourths of a teaspoon of rum flavoring i'm just gonna mix that up does that look good to suit you it does okay jaybird i think it's done right right good you just put that to the side we're gonna let it cool because otherwise the frozen topping would just collapse if we added it to the hot so we'll let that cool all right now jaybird i'm gonna just glaze i'm just gonna dribble this over our cake do you want it almost frosting like i do okay do my half that one okay now this cake is no longer warm so if the cake were warm it would
