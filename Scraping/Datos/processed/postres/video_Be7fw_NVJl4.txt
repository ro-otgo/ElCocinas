- We would just talk about the surprise it was pulled on me last weekend y'all. I think my birthday, I. don't know what date it is, - [Theresa] The 19th, it was January... - I know it's January the. 19th, but I don't know what day that is.. (laughing) It's in a few days or. two days or something. - [Theresa] Yes, it's in two. days, it's on a Wednesday. - Anyway, Eddie came to me and told me that we're doing a family photo shoot this past Saturday. And I didn't think a thing. about it because we do update our photos every couple of years, especially with the children growing. So, I remember back there, Emily was here to do my hair. and makeup and she said, hi, you want to wear your hair, Paula? And I said, well, what's easier on you, to do it down and then. put it up other photos. And I noticed she didn't. get what I was saying. And we do things like this all the time. Finally, I just said, oh, just do it down. If it doesn't look good,. we'll put it up later. And I told Eddie when he was. telling me about this shoot, I said, I don't know if you've noticed, but I hadn't been asking. any questions about this. Because if Eddie tells. me, it's the solid truth. I can go to bed knowing. So.... - [Theresa] Now you know. - Yes, yes. So I was back in the bathroom and I was getting my shirt, I don't know, whatever I was doing, my earrings or something. And I said, it sounds like. a party in the kitchen, so I figured maybe all. the kids had gotten here. And I was hoping that. Michelle was going to be able to make it because her family. had been under the weather. Well, I walked in the kitchen, it was all the folks that. ain't got nothing to do with family photos.. (laughing) - [Eddie] Well, it was kind of a family, it was extended family, - Yeah, extended family, that the kind of family that you pick, because you love them.. - [Eddie] Yeah. - I am standing up here just nibbling on what I'm supposed to be fixing, but Aunt Peggy was here. and Bubbles and Feel. And so many of my friends couldn't come. Not that I have a bunch of friends. - [Theresa] Yes you do.. (laughing) COVID was really... - Yeah, lot of folks couldn't come, but the ones that were. here, appreciate them. But you know, I'm just. not too big on surprise birthday parties.. (laughing) - [Eddie] It was a was. a surprise hoist rose. So as an outdoor event. - I know. And Eddie said something about, he did say we are gonna be. doing a low country boil. No, we gonna be doing a. meal for this photo shoot. And I said, a meal? And he said, I said,. well, what are we doing? And he said, low country boil. - [Eddie] Technically, I did not fit. I mean, we did have hair and. makeup and someone was there taking photos and stuff.. (laughing) - [Theresa] And it was Michael's idea. - [Eddie] And it was Michael's idea. - [Theresa] So, Eddie, you were. only following instructions. - [Eddie] I was, I follow instructions. - Michael was... - [Theresa] But it's a milestone. It's a nice. I'm not gonna say it because... - It is a milestone. No, listen. I've earned every year I got. I have earned them. - [Theresa] So tell them what. age you'll turn in two days. - I'm 57. - [Theresa] You and I are the same age. - Are we?. - [Theresa] We are. - Well, I know it. involves those two numbers and I get confused y'all, is it 57 or 75? - [Theresa] I'm going with 57.. - Me too. - [Eddie] Oh, someone swapped. the candles in the cake. - [Theresa] Did they really? - When I saw those candles, I. turned them around to say 57. That was me.. (laughing) - [Theresa] They're only numbers. - [Eddie] Well, now, Aunt. Peggy up until the day before she came, was still thinking, I thought, because we started planning this back right after Thanksgiving, and... - Really? - [Eddie] Yes, - Gosh, Michael was on the ball, one got. - [Eddie] Aunt Peggy asked Susan, the night before they were coming, now, what should I wear. for this photo shoot? And Susan said, Aunt Peggy,. is not really a photo shoot. (laughing) - She had already forgotten what it was. Oh, I love my Aunt Peggy, so much... - [Theresa] She is 49. - Yeah. - [Eddie] Or 39. She's gonna be 39.. - [Theresa] 39. Sorry. I'm sorry.. (laughing) So, she called me yesterday, y'all. And we were trying to talk to each other and have a conversation. And neither one of us, we've all gotten, we've both gotten something forgetful, some of the easiest words. we can't get them out there. And she was saying, oh, I can't remember. And I'd say, oh, well so, and so, and so, but I can't remember either. So she finally said, hey old, I'm gonna hang up because I can't remember any of the words to my story.. (laughing) I said, I am with ya.. (laughing) I can't tell you my story either, because I'm forgetting half the words. Now this is one of those. recipes that you can do, like a warm bread. pudding or a cold trifle. So I'm doing a cold trifle today and I'm using a box of. instant vanilla pudding. And I've got two cups of heavy. cream that has been whipped. And we are gonna put a combination of cinnamon and sugar in. with the whipped topping. Yeah, this is real, real easy to make. And in this one, I'm gonna add, I've already poured in. the vanilla flavoring. I think I was talking. and didn't tell y'all, but I'm putting some brown sugar. And you can find this recipe. on the website, can't you? - [Theresa] Yes. Ma'am. And as always, it'll be. linked to this video. - Okay, good. All right. So I have put half of the. toasted cinnamon bread down, and now I'm gonna put the raisins in that I have soaked in a dark rum. All right. Now we've got our brown sugar and cinnamon whipped into our cream and. we've got our pudding over here that I added the brown. sugar and vanilla to. All right, so, gonna do spread this out. I can't get over how good, just have good that cinnamon bread is. - [Theresa] I know. You know, it was a buy one, get one, - Buy one, get one free. Well, how come we're. not making two of these? (laughing) - All right.. - [Theresa] You might need to. (laughing) - I know it, I've... - [Theresa] Don't forget the cream, don't forget the whipped cream. - Oh, I forgot. Thank you, Theresa. - [Theresa] We have a picture.. - I know we do. I have to get that pulled out.. - [Eddie] It's right in there. - It's right in there. It's hanging in that pantry. - [Theresa] when you finish this... - Okay. - [Theresa] Dish you might. have to go over there. - Okay.. (laughing) - [Theresa] It used to hang in. photo shoot, do you remember? - Yes. - It was sad losing my mother and daddy, was very sad for Bubba and me, but Aunt Peggy, sure, it was wonderful to have, that was, Aunt Peggy was my mama's sister. - [Theresa] Is she older or younger? - Aunt Peggy was two years younger. - [Theresa] Okay. - So that's all of that. And now I'm gonna put. the rest of our pudding. I think this could have stood another. - [Theresa] We could have. done the big box, the pudding. - Yes, I think so. Because the recipe called for four ounce and I don't think they seem. a such thing as a four ounce. It's like three and a half. So this is gonna be. really skimpy, Theresa. - [Theresa] Well, it's also just... - It's been so many years. - [Theresa] That trifle balls'. a little short and fat too. - Yeah. It's been so long since I've made these. - [Theresa] It's all. gonna eat good though. - Yeah. - [Theresa] I can see it. - Now, I'm gonna put. the rest of the raisins in little rum.. (laughing) This is gone. Spread it up a little bit, this cream. - [Eddie] I can smell the rum. - You can?. (laughing) - [Eddie] The rum and cinnamon. - [Theresa] You could probably. like add bananas to this too. Like, if you wanted to add... - There's so many things you. could do to this Theresa, but this does need to. sit in the refrigerator. But, next time I make it, I will increase the pudding. I think I would use three, I mean, two, three and. a half ounce puddings. Because I do like a lot of custard. - [Theresa] I'll make. that change on the recipe. - Yes, that would be wonderful. - [Theresa] And then that. way they'll have that. - Yeah. I don't wanna eat and try a trifle. And I mean, I'm gonna get every bit back that cream out of there. - [Eddie] Do we have some spiced. pecans left from Christmas? - I don't know if we do or not. I think I might've eaten them all. (laughing) Because there was some. sitting on that table and I think I might've got them into me. - [Theresa] Yeah, Eddie,. you missed our conversation about eating sweets at night. that they talked to us. - So this is gonna go in the refrigerator and let it sit and mellow out. - [Theresa] You've already. tasted all of it together though. (laughing) - It's good, y'all. Okay, so in the refrigerator it goes. You can see the pudding. I didn't separate the pudding, too good. I put too much on the ground floor. (laughing) There we go. I'm gonna cover it, put. it in the refrigerator and let it sit for 2, 3, 4 hours. And it's a nice dessert. I think I might sprinkle some more raisins and maybe some nuts on top and then make a nice, easy. dessert to serve to your friends and your family. So we'll come back and. we'll taste that later. All right. So, our raisin bed trifle has been in the refrigerator, just sitting in and merrying. all those ingredients together. Now I did sprinkle some. real finely chopped pecans and some more raisins on top. So, this is one of those dig deeps. Oh, Michael, I think. you're gonna love these. The cinnamon toast that I had been buying, I didn't use that particular brand, but, same thing. So, I made this trifle. - Thank you. - Out of cinnamon raisin bread. - It's good. - Oh, good, I'm glad you like it. I made it years ago, but,. I've probably forgotten. - [Michael] Looks fresh. I said it looks fresh. - It is fresh. I made it today. - [Michael] I thought. you made it years ago. (laughing) - That's right. It's good, ain't it? I like the raisins, those. are a nice addition. And, the toasted raisin bread is good in there. Cinnamon raisin. - Delicious. - I feel glad you walked in. the door just in time to... - I smelled something. - [Eddie] Have your. dessert before your dinner. (laughing) - I mean, Michael's nose is. as long as Aunt Eugene's nose. Because when I'm cooking something, it's like you walked in the door. Perfect timing. Delicious. Loving best dishes, y'all.
