[Music] we're fixing to move on to an old standard of cookie now this particular recipe that I used was my grandmother Paul's and Grandma made hers involved well and sometimes I do them that way too but over the years I just started making them in fingers but in the meantime I've got two and a half cups of plain flour or all-purpose flour 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar we're just going to mix those two ingredients together this cookie is very very easy but it does take a while because they have to bake for about 20 or 25 minutes which is what about 15 minutes longer than a normal cookie whoops feels very dough girl all right now I'm going to start this off by using a wooden spoon to just kind of cut that butter in there a little alright now I'm going to put in some vanilla flavoring and if you wanted to kind of shake your flavoring up you could do just about any kind of flavoring you want to orange flavoring would be nice almond would be delicious in there all right now I'm going to add our chopped pecans and you can see how quickly let me get my hands in here coming together I still think that some of my best utensils are the ones that God gave me these two hands right here they make great spoons and mixers so like I said my grandmother Paul used to roll these into balls but I'm going to roll mine into fingers and I just remembered our oven is on 350 from our pecans so I'm going to reach over here and turn that to 325 and if my hands are not too greasy I'm just going to fan it to cool it down for a minute because we're ready to put these in the oven all right so here we go into the oven let's go over here and check you can see how they swelled up a little those are perfect just barely a light brown then I can right now we're just going to toss these in our powdered sugar while they're warm and look at sticking so nicely got me a plate [Music]
