hey everybody I'm Paula Deen and guess what I want y'all to get your turn ready because today we're gonna have an ice cream social and I'm gonna make some of the best ice cream and sorbet that y'all have ever tasted first I'm gonna start off with a savory butter pecan ice cream and a sweet sweet strawberry sorbet and while they're freezing I'm gonna be making some crunchy ginger cookies and Maggie's decadent brownies so y'all stick around you his show makes me want to Paris yep do you know why because it's all about sweet stuff today I'm gonna be doing an ice cream social and I'm gonna be doing some goodies that are so tasty along with the ice cream I've got my basket of strawberries that we're gonna be using in a few minutes but why don't we get started with our ice cream the first ice cream I'm gonna make today is a butter pecan and so I'm gonna start by melting a tablespoon of butter I'm gonna toss the pecans in there and let them toast and I'm gonna watch them carefully because we don't want them to scorch because if they scorch you're no good so we're just gonna let those lightly Brown right there and then I'm gonna drain them on a little paper towel I'm gonna come over here and I've got three cups of whole milk not 2% not that diet stuff three cups of whole milk and to that I'm gonna add one can of evaporated milk and now understand that that is evaporated not condensed milk some people don't get those two confused alright and I'm gonna add to this a small pack of vanilla pudding you can see our ice cream is gonna be really really a nice pretty yellow that smelling so good I'm gonna add a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla all right now today I'm using one of the little counter ice cream makers you can use this in that type of ice cream maker or you can use it in a regular ice cream churn so our Bowl has been in the freezer for 24 hours we're gonna turn it on and this is very important that you turn your machine on first because if you pour your ice cream mixture in it will immediately freeze to the sides of it and then your your blade won't go on I'm just gonna slowly pour our ice cream mixture into the freezer all right so I'm gonna let this churn until the ice cream really starts to thicken so while that's churning let's come on over here I'm gonna be making a strawberry sorbet all right I'm gonna add two cups of sugar to 2 cups of ball in water and I'm gonna mix those up and then we're gonna need to let this cool after that sugar entirely melts in that hot water and I've got some back here that has already melted and cooled all right so let's come over here and we'll put our strawberries in our food processor and I'm just gonna puree them they smell so good and now I'm gonna add 1/4 of a cup of fresh lime juice and that's going to give it a real part taste alright okay alright we've got our strawberries pureed up nice nice and fine alright now I'm just gonna bring them over here and I'm gonna run them through this sieve and this is gonna remove all the seeds that the strawberries have and I'm gonna help it along by stirring them around strawberries are a beautiful color aren't they so I'll just say that now to our strawberry juice I'm gonna add a half a cup of white corn syrup and I'm just gonna stir that around alright now the last thing I'm gonna add is our simple syrup that we made earlier and we allowed it to cool so our ingredients are nice and cold you can make this earlier in the day put it in the refrigerator measuring cup because I don't trust myself to hit that hole with the ingredients in them in the bowl so and I'm gonna do the same thing with this one I'm gonna slowly add my strawberry puree all right there we go that's gonna be wonderful so now it's time to add the butter pecan to our vanilla base alright so I'm just gonna slowly add these and let the machine have a chance to mix those in so this just looks great so I'm gonna take a minute to clean up get everything out of the way because I can't hardly wait to taste this ice cream in this sorbet so while I'm cleaning up grab you a cup of coffee and I'll meet you back here in like two minutes [Music] [Music] hey y'all I'm just fixing to put this in the storage containers and throw it in the freezer all right so I'm just gonna pour this in the container and I'm gonna throw it in the freezer and let that get nice and hard and I've already got a strawberry sorbet poured up and you can see it's really really loose it's I'm really poured it up and a soft-serve state because I'm gonna put it in the freezer and let it finish hardening and I've already got some that it's gotten hard you can see what it looks like and you can see how pretty that is and how fine gosh I can't wait to taste it but I think I'm gonna taste this one because it's still nice and soft give me brain freeze mmm oh my gracious mmm I don't put this up and get it out of my way I'm not gonna finish with these other two things that I want to show you so I better put this away I'll just wind up standing there eating ice cream for the next 30 minutes and all the sponsor so canceled and then I won't have a show but I'll be nice and full all right I want to show you a wonderful ginger cookie this is gonna be so so good with our butter pecan ice cream now I'm gonna start with 3/4 a cup of shortening I'm gonna add a cup of sugar I'm gonna add one egg and 1/4 of a cup of molasses oh it smells so good I love molasses gosh it almost tastes like a strong cane syrup it's so good all right now we're just gonna take these ingredients and we're gonna blend them up real good last it took it a while you can see what a nice rich color that molasses turn this into now we're going to come over here I've got two cups of all-purpose flour I'm going to add two teaspoons of baking soda a teaspoon of cinnamon a teaspoon of ginger and a half a teaspoon of cloves and a pinch of salt now I'm just gonna stir this up and we're gonna dump it over into our shortening and molasses mixture that we've got over here I'm just gonna give that a little stir all right I'm gonna try to swing that batter am i swinging it on y'all [Laughter] okay here we go all right now I'm gonna take these and I'm gonna roll them into a small bowl a little larger than a marble and I've got some just plain granulated sugar right there I love my ice cream right now I'm just gonna toss these around in the sugar okay I've got my oven preheated to 350 degrees and we're gonna bake these for about 12 minutes and while those are baking I want to come over here and show you Maggie's decadent brownies and they are decadent now I've got me a 13 by 9 by pin that's been greased right here got my two sticks of butter and my four squares of semi-sweet chocolate melted so I've turned off the fire and to that I'm gonna add two cups of granulated sugar and I'm gonna add one cup of all-purpose flour and a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm gonna just mix that up and I think I'm gonna take it off the heat because I don't want it to cook my eggs that's a lot of chocolate looks and smells delicious all right I'm gonna come up here and I'm gonna add my four eggs okay so we got our four eggs in there I'm just gonna mix those up good I'm gonna pour that into our prepared pan and we're gonna put it in a 350 degree oven and we're gonna bake it for about 25 minutes well we ain't finished with them yet either when we come back I'm gonna show you how I finish them up or hi Maggie finishes up and we're gonna be tasting those wonderful ginger cookies so I'll see y'all back in a couple of minutes [Music] [Music] so y'all look at what I got ginger cookies don't they look good I love the cracks in them I gotta find something to put them on oh these look delicious and here I'm there already Chris is there hitting the plate I can tell that they're gonna be really nice and crunchy oh they're gonna be perfect with that ice cream all right you're probably saying well those brownies don't look so decadent to meet Paulo well let me show you the really decadent part of these brownies well this is like deja vu because in this bowl I've got two more sticks of butter and four more squares of semi-sweet chocolate so those that are counting this brownie now has one full pound of butter in it four sticks all right I've got that melted so I'm gonna turn that off now I'm gonna bring it over here this is gonna be like our icing for these brownies I'm gonna use 1/2 a cup of an egg substitute a pasteurized egg I'm gonna pour that in there along with some vanilla and one box of confectionery sugar it's just one little box y'all all right we're gonna mix that up most frostings do call for a whole box of confectioner sugar but I have to tell y'all most brownie recipes don't call for four sticks of butter all right now I'm gonna add four cups of marshmallows and I'm gonna stir them quickly because I don't want them to melt I want you to be able to see them and this particular recipe reminds me so much of my wilmington Island Marsh mud cake gosh it's so good all right well let's take our brownies out of the oven all right let's take our brownies out and I'm just gonna pour this icing on top of them [Laughter] Maggie's decadent brownies I think the name suits the recipe all right now I'm gonna just spread that over look at that YUM all right I'm gonna take this brownie I'm gonna let it cool and then I'm gonna stick it in the refrigerator but I'm gonna just sitting back here came out of my eyesight so I won't be tempted I just adore melted chocolate oh now I've got one that's cooled back here waiting on me so let's cut this one and see how it's gonna look we're gonna make four lines of brownies gonna go to something a little bit smaller to get that first piece out with Margaret Cho I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself girl those look wonderful but you all know what I want to taste I want to taste that one back there that's hot and the chocolates all melted and since this is my show I think I can do what I want to look at that y'all look at it running down that spoon hmm so y'all give me a minute excuse us while we come back I'm gonna show you how to turn a snowball into a delicious ice cream [Music] I got some nice tips for y'all today I know you're thinking Paulo what are you doing that big ol bowl of snow in front of you in Georgia well believe it or not once in a while a freak thing will happen well in 1973 we had a huge snowstorm we had 17 inches of snow and there was a housekeeper that lived across the street it was a dark a widow doctor and he had two little boys and and made us a big old bowl of snow ice cream it was the best thing ever putting my mouth hadn't had him he says 1973 but I'm gonna show y'all how a team a made it she went out got a big ball of snow she took a can of condensed milk and poured it into that snow [Music] she added some vanilla flavoring and she just mixed all that up and I tell y'all what I couldn't believe that snow could taste so good [Music] but how wonderful is that ice cream just doesn't get any better and Eddie Mae was probably in her late 50s or 60s so that she's no longer with us but and he may just know wherever you are I think about you and that snow ice cream that day it's just the best stuff in the world look it's better than any ice cream you'll ever eat thanks Eddie make y'all I have to say that I love my work every show that I do I love but some I have to tell you I really love a little bit more than others and today's show is one of those between the butter pecan ice cream and the strawberry sorbet and the ginger cookies and for goodness sakes Maggie those decadent brownies are unbelievable but I have to tell you the thing that I enjoy doing most today Eddie Mae's snow ice cream was my very very favorite today to make and eat and I hope you'll enjoy all the other recipes we've made today and as always I've loved every minute that I've spent with y'all I thank you for coming and until next time y'all I send you loving best dishes from my kitchen to yours
