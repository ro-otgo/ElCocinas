hey y'all I hope I hope y'all are on well I hope everybody has kind of settled into this new normal you know whatever in the heck it is I know that I've been in the kitchen cooking a lot of stuff y'all because that's one of the ways I found myself a way to keep me busy and occupied and keep everybody fed at the same time because you know that's always how I've showed my love for somebody is cooking for them so I want to share this recipe with y'all today and as I've told you before I'm feeling requests and I got a bunch but eventually I will get to your request so today I'm gonna share with y'all loaded banana bread if y'all like me you know you'll buy a bunch of bananas and you may not be in the mood to eat bananas so I wound up having to make banana bread with them and so I'm gonna show y'all this wonderful recipe and this is actually from my newest book southern bacon and this recipe is wonderful because it's got so much stuff in it in fact oh look at this one I've already baked it and brought in either oven Oh doesn't that look delicious lots of nuts I think that's why I like it so much because it's nutty kind of like its maker so the first thing I'm gonna do y'all is mix up my dry ingredients so that is 2 cups of all-purpose flour what's that 1/2 a cup of sugar no 1 cup of sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder make sure you get it on that out half a teaspoon of salt and a half it I think it's a half a teaspoon wonder what I do in the glasses half a teaspoon of baking soda y'all my glasses all right so that's our dry ingredients and you want to take your whisk and whisk all those ingredients together because that's almost like sifting it doing this during this quarantine my dog has gotten so jumpy they barked at the drop of a hat New Year's Teresa got three nervous Nellie's okay I'm gonna flip back to the side and now we're gonna mix up a wet ingredients and I want to show y'all the way that I've come up with during the years over the years you know any way I can find to help help the process so I like to mash my bananas and you'll want to make sure they're very very ripe in fact an over overripe banana makes the best bread so I like to mash that in the skin and then just peel it and that gives it a great head start so just like that and I'm gonna just get every bit of that banana all right so I'm gonna use four ripe bananas and this will yield me one 9x5 loaf pan of bread and I'll tell you what it's real real good to make up to make a spread to go on this bread if you'll make take up cream cheese and herbs and make your herbs bring it it is so good with that brand it's delicious rather than something sweet something savory in fact I had the most wonderful recipe for cream cheese but I don't know what I did with it it's somewhere up then the other two million recipes in my head all right so this is a great tip if you always use it doesn't take nearly so much muscle all right so I'm gonna a4 mashing my bananas alone see see how quickly new when you mash them in the peeling it goes so quick alright so I'm gonna add my vanilla 1 teaspoon of vanilla I think that was a half a stick of melted butter is that right okay and yogurt now I am using Greek yogurt for this recipe but when I made that first rafi I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream and it worked out perfect so we just don't mix something called wet ingredients now I'm gonna add the eggs and look at my beautiful eggs y'all you know we got a chicken coop and the depends on the chicken is to want color their eggs are hey Mikey and I've got how many chickens do we have that lay the blue eggs Mike just move on and the rest are brown they're so pretty these almost look like Easter eggs I love that I think that's about the color of our living room Long's eat me that's why I like that that color so much alright and these are fresh free shakes yo and my pinky swears she can tell the difference so anyway skip back to the banana period I love making muffins and fruity breads because you never ever have to pull out a mixer because one of the rules of making muffins and breads like this is that you come over beat them you want to just mix those ingredients until they're blended so no need to pull out a mixer okie dokie so we're going to pour this into our flour you move these banana peeling so I'm gonna add 1/2 a cup of raisins and I'll do love love love raisins and I'm giving you the recipe just as it reads um half a cup of nuts let's whatever call a once in the nut family so I had it a few more I just love what the nuts do to it okay and um I've got a half a cup reserved here because I'm gonna sprinkle that on top you can see where I sprinkle the the nuts on top of that alright so this is almost mixed up good enough hmm those bananas smells so strong wonderful banana aroma is in there all right so here we go we're ready to put this together and I'm just gonna try to fold that in and it'll take I don't take 2 or 3 minutes but not not long I just go under and bring that flower up to the top and the egg mixture down and this is a real thick batter y'all so don't don't worry you've got plenty of liquid mm-hmm it's coming together y'all and remember just until it's all the flour is moistened be so good all right since we're gonna have to love John we out too well you can take one home Teresa or we I did y'all eat everything you sent home the other day I'm trying to help Teresa not have to cook some way all right so I don't I don't see any more drag flour so here we go I'm gonna spray my pan that's what sounds like it's just about out breathe come out very very easy okay that is some pretty batter booty booty booty and I mean I want everybody see what was left in the bowl that would make like that okay all right so you'll want to take the back of your spatula and just level this out and we're gonna put it in the oven set at 350 and we're gonna bake it for 50 minutes and after its baked for 20 minutes I'm gonna take some fall and and cover it with fit ten fall because I don't want the top to get too dark so that easy love it love those recipes so I have the kiddos anybody wanna taste mm-hmm well y'all come on
