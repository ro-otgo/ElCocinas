oh my goodness I'm like over the moon excited because I am in the kitchen with two of my children my beautiful daughter-in-law Brooke and my son Jamie and I tell you why ain't nothin no better than having your kids in the kitchen especially after they get old enough y'all to have some sense to them they can really help unlike the stage that Jack's at now all right well let's get started we're gonna make a flower power chocolate cookie and Brooke is gonna be mixing together two sticks of softened butter and she's gonna add a cup of confectioner's sugar these are sweetened cookies and then she's gonna add a half a cup of granulated sugar one egg a teaspoon of vanilla and Jamie son you are gonna be mixing up three cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and I'm melting chocolate I've got the easy job mm-hmm and when Jamie and I get done we're just gonna add it to Brooke spot look how pretty that pink mixer is Meritor typically if you are just matching today girl I've gotten my practice lately with making cookies because Jack is on this cookie kick every day mama can we make cookies and I kind of have to bribe them and say well if you eat your dinner well cookies he does absolutely love to cook and bake so cookie making practice right now that is great all right what's mounted son all right so Brooke I say just dump Jamie just take it all this is gonna be a real thick dough oh don't forget the egg Brooke sorry I was about to let you forget and your vanilla flavoring okay so we are gonna add our dough out y'all and it needs to rest in the refrigerator for about an hour team work work going like a cutest team all right so in the chocolate goes we just doesn't that look delicious and it smells good too and just make sure everything's incorporated son would you put that away please and let's get this cleaned off so that we can pat our dough out and I think that's really Brooke huh it looks delicious looks like fudge now I'm gonna sprinkle our parchment paper with some powdered sugar we could use cocoa let me help you make sense some cocoa you gonna use your hand [Music] half of this mom on this parchment paper yes alright so just Pat that out son then another piece of parchment paper more sugar and then the other half of our dough I don't like to waste a drop although I would like to be eaten Peter do you know how mad Jack would be if he knew that y'all were over eight guineas house making cookies well you can bring them on oh here son don't waste a drop oh that's a whole nother foot sign well I figured I'd leave something in the bowl for y'all to lick I'm gonna try to resist alright so in the refrigerator that's gonna rest for one hour so this should be really firm when we pull it out easy to roll out it's funny how time flies when you're having a good time an hour gone just like that Brooke I'm gonna give you one and then Jamie's got one Brooke you can just dip yours in the confectioner sugar and it won't stick and y'all just roll them out just a little bit they don't need to be too too thin it's it's hard it's hard just give me a little sugar little bit of sugar sure I'll give you some I'll give you sugar thank you so much all kinds of sugar in the kitchen today oh this takes all kinds of strength I know all right so y'all just take your your cookie cutters and now remember Jamie you want to use every bit of your dose so and you can diffuse in the powdered sugar and that won't keep it from sticking and of course we're gonna use the flour cookie cutter oh that's pretty now that's about a quarter of an inch thick y'all mine's a little bit thicker it's perfectly alright we've got our cookie sheet lined with parchment paper love love love these and we're gonna bake them we've got our oven preheated y'all to 350 degrees and we're gonna bake these for 10 minutes perfect let's see we've got another cookie sheet over there so I'm gonna go ahead and put these in the oven while you're taking your leftover dough and rolling it out so 350 for 10 minutes look how nice and hearty I mean that's like a meal right there huh all right so we're gonna make the icing brulee so we're gonna need a half a stick of cream cheese that's softened a half a stick of butter and two and a half cups of powdered sugar very simple just a little cream cheese icing and this is gonna be really thick we want it to sit on our cookie little vanilla just eyeball it all right miss it there perfect Jamie's getting our pastry bag ready so who's gonna do why I'll do this sprinkle okay I'll fight all right and look at our cute little tins Brooke so this makes a neat gift right out there just to get my teachers the friends uh-huh they'd be beautiful Easter cookie and soon just give me a little drop a
