[Music] okay gone some bait with the bananas how'd it go hi child good good I thought it was real good yeah we have fun that's as simple as a big pile of home cooking is still no longer what you to go back to the Bobby Deen whatever no the next dish that we're going to do is just a banana split cake but I have to tell y'all this is one of those recipes that I've always had a lot of calls on because of the controversy of the raw egg in the dish and this dish doesn't get cooked and you know I'm just not afraid of raw eggs as long as they're nice and tight in their shell no cracks and they hadn't expired but for those of you out there that might have an issue with that you can use a pasteurized egg in place of it and then that way you have no worries at all Jamie why don't you start by making a crust I turn to my favorite things graham cracker crumbs and butter mine too it's about four cups of graham cracker crumbs and then two stick of butter and we're going to do a little something different the recipe doesn't call the stick this crust in the oven but I like what he does to the if it makes it turn a hardening form more like a a hard crust so we're just going to press this into our dish and we're going to stick it in the oven so like five to eight minutes and pull it out and let it cool so while you're doing that I'm going to slice the bananas and Bobby you want to go ahead and make the filling side I'm going to start with two sticks of butter and I'm going to go ahead and begin to cream that I'm going to add two eggs beat two eggs into this as well and I'm going to add in a box one one-pound box of powdered sugar all right Chinese son if you want to go ahead and get that in the dish and get it in the oven we're going to put that in a 350 degree oven I said for about five to eight minutes just put to hard enough and Bobby how are you coming over there son perfectly all right Jamie I've got another one in the oven if you would go ahead and get it out please because we want to make sure it's cool we don't want to put this together while it's hot you know Bobby it's funny you never had any cooking experience like Jamie had you really had you you in sales yeah well I got my career trial by fire I really wanted you to join it and you did you quit your salesman's job and you came over and you became the dishwasher I've been working out for you taking me so far and then you were promoted yeah just all the desserts a pastry shell and I got really good at it never got bored with it but I really got no not at all and I've always uh you know growing up with you or growing up in your house Rhode Island up along this ya know I always enjoyed cooking but I didn't really get the joy of once I started cooking for people and getting their reaction from it that's when I really started to enjoy it Jimmy there's nothing like our job granted it's hard hard work you really put yourself on the line out there you really opened yourself up for shots but if you're good at what you do there's nothing like that immediate gratification that we get from walking out on the floor and people saying oh my goodness you know I just love your food see what looks on their face huh that looks so good buttery Jamie but you know it's not the easiest thing in the world to spread mm-hmm alright so what we're going to do now son just going to spread those bananas all over and then we're going to top our bananas with the canned crushed pineapple that's been very very well drained alright I'm going to top this now you can use a frozen whipped topping but y'all know when I'm making these kind of desserts that I only use one thing and that sweetened fresh cream all right so that was just that simple and now we're just going to top it with a few graham cracker crumbs and an ad from Jamie's crust and that looks yummy mmm and you got dishes yes oh this looks so good can you fix it this month well I think I'm just going through is it good to really I think I'm going to try just a bite I love the pineapple in it I do too the pineapple really makes it to you my darling and to the part you played in to all the desserts that we serve at the lady and son I think I'm the reason for your success here for you Bobby kissing me that's really good [Music]
