perfectly Paula surprise inside so I hope you brought your appetite coz it's time to fill up on a day of decadence Michael Michael I got a I gotta run the store I'll be back in a little bit girls guess what time it is it's shopping time one more trip to kitchen caboodle whenever I want a little something special to use in my kitchen I'm sure to visit kitchen caboodle it's a great place to go because you never know what you're gonna find there they have everything from helpful cooking gadgets to beautiful serving dishes to well who knows like this great little pi marker it makes preparations on top of your pie for you to come along so you never have to worry about who's gonna get the biggest piece I'll have to add this to my shopping cart today but what did I come here for again oh yeah some pretty plates for my pies and hmm I wonder if they have something here to send a pie in you know I could browse all day in this store but I better get back to the kitchen if we're gonna get all those pies done in time thanks Janice you always have such a great selection I know y'all probably think that I stay at kitchen caboodle but I tell y'all what I just do love that little store and I want you to go find some pretty plates but my pies because that's what today's show is about it's all about pies look at that beautiful plate and I got some other stuff down in here that I'm gonna be talking to y'all in a little bit about so in the meantime I'm gonna be making the lady and Sons chicken pot pie once a week I used to make old timey chicken pot pie and everybody loved it but I wanted one that was delicious and also pretty so I came up with this one and I'm using some boneless chicken breasts that I've cut into cubes and we're gonna saute that in about a third of a stick of butter I'm gonna put this in the sink I wanted to get rid of that bowl because I didn't want to forget that I'd had raw chicken in it you want to be very very careful and make sure you use clean utensils and wash your hands after handling poultry all right so I'm gonna put a little salt in this a little seasoning salt and a little black pepper and I'm gonna come back over here and check our puff pastry it's a great product but we're gonna take our sheet of puff pastry all right now I'm gonna just slice through that just like that this is such a wonderful product so what we're gonna do is lay out our dough and we're gonna lattice this you want to make sure that your crust is gonna fit the bowl that you're using so I think about four lattices will work now I'm gonna take every other strip and I'm gonna come in here and lattice this and it doesn't have to be perfect because I found that imperfections is really pretty and it gives it a little interest in the shape all right so we've got the top to our pie and you see how easy that was now I'm gonna brush this so it'll have a pretty shiny top at the restaurant we just used one whole egg and we beat up so yolk and the white and this will give it a pretty glazed look it'll be nice and shiny and pretty and brown okay so we're gonna put this in the oven and bake this off all right so we're gonna let that bake off a few minutes and now we're gonna turn around and come back to our pot of chicken which is looking good so I'm gonna go ahead and add some onion to that oh my gracious that's strong and garlic all right I'm gonna sprinkle this with flour no I think about two tablespoons that flower is gonna help produce a nice rich stock alright so now I'm gonna take heavy cream and you could use milk or half and half but at the restaurant we use heavy creaking a little bit more you see I'm trying to slowly add in that alright so we're just gonna let that simmer and I've got some saut√©ed carrots that still got a little crunch to it and these are just frozen green peas I wouldn't use a canned pea now we're gonna have some chicken flavor but we're not gonna have quite as much as I would like so I'm gonna help it along by using a chicken base and you can actually buy this product at the grocery store now it's in the soup section actually now you'll want to be careful with this product though because contains a tremendous amount of salt so you'll want to be very careful that you don't put too much salt in your pot pie and I'm gonna finish it off with just a little nutmeg it's amazing what fresh nutmeg does for cream sauces all right now I'm gonna turn around here and check on our pie crust I've got one over here that's ready and you see how there's so much butter in that puff pastry that it can't hardly stay on that pan how pretty that looks and I'm gonna see if this one's ready yet oh yeah it's nice perfect it's perfect I'm just gonna stack it up right there with the other one okay this is ready you see I've got it hot and bubbly so you could make this the day before the morning of and put it in the refrigerator and then just come back and heat it up and it's just amazing that you can have this kind of meal in what 15 to 20 minutes just amazing and remember now when you're making your pie you want to make sure that you bake this off in an oven proof dish I'm gonna bring this up here and I want to clean it off just a little bit and then we're just going to take our latticed puff pastry shell and we're just gonna sit it up on our pie and we're gonna do a little push down on it I want that rich creamy sauce to kind of bubble up and adhere to that crust I'm gonna throw these in the oven and when we come back I'm gonna share with you my cousin Johnny's white macadamia nut pie that's over the top [Music] [Music] alright those pies are looking good but I'm gonna give them just a couple of more minutes in the meantime we're gonna turn around here and we're gonna make one of my cousin Johnny's specialty pies now Johnny owns a bakery called Gabriel's bakery and Marietta Georgia and I asked Johnny I said you know I won't I want the favorite recipe of your husband's cuz I really wanted this to be a man pleaser so she said this one's yet polish so we're gonna start off by making a ganache I've put some semi-sweet dark chocolate chips in the bowl and I'm gonna heat up some heavy cream now I'm not gonna bring this to a bowl but while that's heating up I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna put my sugar just a granulated sugar and I'm gonna add some softened cream cheese I'm gonna beat the cream cheese and the sugar together in the meantime our chips are in the bowl and we're gonna pour our hot cream over that and we're just gonna stir those just like that and you see how quickly you have ganache there's nothing to it just a fancy word for something very very simple all right I'm just gonna set that to the side now and let it cool because we're fixing to get to the really good part of this time I think this pie might be a man catcher you know what I mean girls all right I'm gonna add some heavy cream that hasn't been whipped just gonna add it very very slowly this is a real rich all right now I'm gonna fold in some heavy cream that's been whipped we're just gonna fold that in by going to the bottom of the bowl with our spatula and coming up on the other side because we don't want it to break down on us okay and then we're gonna fold in our macadamia nuts I've got some wonderful fresh orange zest oh and it smells so good and strong we're gonna just fold that in and now we're gonna fold in the best part and that's the melted white chocolate oh gosh I could eat that just like that all right we're just gonna fold that in hi Gertie girl I can't believe you don't wait 200 pounds and I can't believe I don't wait three all right that looks out of this world all right so all we're gonna do now is put that in a prepared pie crust that's been baked off oops and speaking of pies I smell chicken pot pie that's what you're smelling eating it Gertie look at these beautiful pies I'm just gonna sprinkle it just like I do at the restaurant with a little fresh chopped parsley and a couple of spoons for eatin oh they look so good all right so we're gonna come back over here to our pie and this has been baked off and we're just gonna fill our pie crust with this delectable filling okay this one's ready to go into the freezer and I've got another one in here that's actually ready watch it ready it's all ready for the ganache this is sinful looking all right now I'm gonna do this kind of slow and gentle I'm putting this warm chocolate ganache over sugaring cream cheese and macadamia nuts and my gracious now just when you think this pie is done it ain't I'm gonna put some whipping cream on it but before I do that I'm actually gonna taste these pies these chicken pot pies I think they've cooled enough for me to taste them and they look just too good and this is the way I like to eat mine I like to break off that little edge and get in there and chase it [Music] I can see why it's a favorite at the restaurant I just love it just when y'all think it couldn't get any better y'all come right back because I'm gonna finish up this pie and then I'm gonna make a mystery pecan pie that's unforgettable [Music] okay I've got some whipped cream in the pastry bag and I'm gonna just pipe some whipped cream onto our pie I actually let that ganache kind of chill all right now I'm gonna just sprinkle it with a few extra nuts and I'm gonna pop this back in the freezer so to my sorry I don't get to taste it right now but I'm gonna get to it in the next 10 minutes oh it looks delicious all right pecan pies I know you've probably all had a pecan pie but I've got a new pecan pie recipe for y'all and this was sent to me from a friend from New Orleans all right now I've got three eggs busted I'm gonna add some sugar and I'm gonna add some white corn syrup now a lot of people use white corn syrup for the pecan pies a lot of people use a dark corn syrup to me it doesn't too much make a difference as long as this syrup in it you're just gonna whisk this around it doesn't have to be beat up to to good all right and I'm gonna add the vanilla all right this is our syrup layer and this is gonna be the surprise layer that's in this pecan pie and we're gonna start with cream cheese a little bit more sugar a little salt to cut the sweetness you know what I mean a little more vanilla and one more egg and we're just going to incorporate that together a pecan pie is great for beginner so if you want to surprise the family pull this recipe out on them and see what happens all right now we're gonna add our cream cheese to the bottom of the pie looks like melted white chocolate doesn't it just kind of smear that around evenly here we go now I'm using a chopped pecan you can use a whole one but it makes it much much easier to slice by the piece when your nuts are chopped up like this one so you have to decide what you want all right now this is the standard filling right here for a pecan pie all we're gonna do is take this and pour it on top of those nuts and then when this pie is done all the nuts will have risen to the top now if I can just get it to the oven without spilling it and you can see that I'm gonna bake this in a raw pie shell because this times actually gonna bake for about 45 minutes so you don't want to pre-bake your shower it would get too Brown I got it in there without spilling it so we couldn't come over here and check on this one oh my gracious look how good that looks I'm actually gonna put it over here in this corner cuz I got a great breeze coming in that door so I'm gonna let that sit right there and cool and now I'm fixing to go get that white-chocolate macadamia-nut pie out and sample it to make sure it's good enough for my family and friends and I'm gonna see what yeah look at it goose and Daniel it almost looks like it's got a heartbeat Johnny I think you got you a winner baby girl nice thing that I think a little bit more cream is in order and a little bit more nuts let's see what we got I swear it'll make you sassy oh mama you know hang around because when we come back I'm gonna give you some tips on shipping that pecan pie just somebody that you love [Music] half the fun to me of making pies is sharing them with people that I love and there's no better pie to share with folks than the pecan pie it's one of the sturdiest of all the pies remember when I walked in at the opening of the show and I had a paper bag full of stuff well this is one of the things that I had in there so what I'm gonna do is just drop that pie down into the bottom half of that container and I'm gonna take some parchment paper and I'm gonna seal this lid in there really really good and I'm gonna tape back down that will help keep it secure in the bottom of that container all right what we're gonna do now is we're gonna use what they call a peanut and all I'm gonna do is tuck the pie down in here and then I'm gonna put the peanuts back on top of it so it won't allow that guy to move around and I even made some tags off of the computer to go on this and you see that it reads best dishes from my kitchen to yours so be sure and go to your computer and make your little labels these work out great I had a wonderful time with y'all today making all these recipes Inc I hope y'all will try some of these recipes I hope you love them in fact look at that
