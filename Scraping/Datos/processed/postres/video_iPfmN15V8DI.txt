- Hey everybody. It's Bobby here on the Paula. Deen channel on YouTube. Thanks for tuning in with us. I've got a really, well we, Teresa and I, have a really great recipe here for you. This is perfect for a pool party or a really hot sunny July. afternoon at your house. We put something together. that we're gonna have out by the pool a little bit later on for the kids when they. wake up from their nap. And this is an Ice Cream Sundae Pizza. It sounds decadent, and it is really decadent. This is totally for fun. and probably not every day but the kids will love it. And you'll love it too. And you'll see here in just a minute this is not gonna be a. lot of action on my part. Theresa has done a lot. of the prep work for me because you needed a few hours to do it. And I'll explain that. What we started with, well we started with a big. round pizza shaped baking dish. And we took one box of. just standard brownie mix off your grocery store shelf, and we made it exactly how. they tell you to make it. And we put it in the baking pan and we baked it off for, I would check it at maybe 15 or 20 minutes because in this well,. let's just look at it. - [Teresa] That's actually. Bobby, a deep dish-- - Pizza - [Teresa] Pizza pan. - Okay. Yeah. This is a deep dish pizza pan. And so you can imagine. one box of brownie mix is gonna spread really,. really thin in there. So, so you don't burn it, you'd want to check it. in about 15 minutes at, you know I'd put it in the oven for 350. That's what Teresa did. And we've got some Blue Bell ice cream. That is my mom's favorite. I think that she says. that to you all the time how much she likes Blue Bell ice cream and all the grandkids in the family. Everybody goes wild for that when momma serves it at her house. So we've got the brownie mix in the pan. This is a deep dish. pizza pan, and baked it. And we let the ice cream. soften on the counter and we let the brownie mix cool after we baked it in the oven. This was, Theresa did. all this a long time ago, 'cause I didn't have that kind of time. So now this thing is frozen. solid sitting here on my counter and where the ice cream comes in, if I didn't already say it is, we let it sit on the counter and soften, and then we spread a half. gallon of Blue Bell ice cream all over the top of that brownie. (Bobby laughing) - [Teresa] Bobby. We just did another one. We've done a lot of ice cream this summer. - This is gonna taste so, so good. If you look to my left over here, you'll see that we have Hershey's Caramel and we have Hershey's Hot Fudge Sundae and we have maraschino cherries and we have heavy whipped cream. And for the health nut in you we've got some chopped almonds here. This is gonna be so. good, but it's gonna be-- - [Teresa] Those are chopped peanuts. - Chopped peanuts, I'm sorry. This is gonna be so good but it's gonna be so. fattening and delicious. So happy summer. All right. Well, our pizza is put together so let's go ahead and cut a piece. Do you, what do you think Teresa? Should I try to cut one piece or should I go ahead and cut the thing? - [Teresa] I would go down the middle. - Yeah, let's go all the way. Oh, that's cutting perfectly too. That's like the consistency of a really really cold cheese cake. is what that feels like. - [Teresa] And it does take, just so you know, it takes about four hours and it tells you that you can cut it anywhere from two hours to two days and you can leave it in the. freezer before you serve it. - [Bobby] Yeah. Two days, I think I might push the limits and go to two days on this thing. Yeah, let it just be a nice frozen piece of, what do you think? Oh, look at those big delicious pieces of Ice Cream Sundae Pizza. Those are pretty generous portions. I may have to. I may have to do an extra cut. - [Teresa] Well, the. nice thing about this too is you can do a piece at a time. - [Bobby] Yeah. - [Teresa] And then that way it can last for a couple of days. (Bobby laughing) - The middle of it-- - [Teresa] Just what we need in our refrigerators or freezers. - Look, look, you're kidding yourself, and you're lying to everybody if you say that this is gonna last for a couple days 'cause it ain't. - [Teresa] Well not with your triplets. - Judge all you want, but this is gonna be so, so delicious. So. - [Teresa] Here we go. - [Bobby] Yeah, these are so big. - [Teresa] It's okay. - [Bobby] These are so big. - [Teresa] Your mom would be proud of us. - [Bobby] Oh my we, my. mom, my mom, my mom, my mama. My mama would be very proud of this. Yes. Okay. - [Teresa] You're good. - [Bobby] Oh, wow. - [Teresa] Oh it's not. - [Bobby] Yeah, it's completely cut, but my spatula is gonna. tear it up a little bit down here on the end. So in an effort to not do. that, let me double spatula. See if I can keep from tearing it up. Not that it matters 'cause. it's gonna get torn up anyway. Oh yeah. - [Teresa] Oh yeah. Let me go in and show. them so they can see that. Can you pick that up just a little bit, 'cause it's kind of hard. to see the chocolate? - [Bobby] That brownie's. thin on the bottom. - [Teresa] It is thin. - [Bobby] Let's see. Let's see if we can see it maybe a little better inside. the deep dish pizza pan. - [Teresa] Well now one of the. things that everybody knows with the economy as it is, the brownie mixes are. smaller than they used to be. - [Bobby] Yeah. - [Teresa] But you. still can use the same-- - [Bobby] Ooh sorry. - [Teresa] You can still. use the same brownie size. It's just gonna be a little thinner than what the 21 ounce would've done. - And that's why we. talked about it earlier. You don't want to bake this in the oven too long at 350, 'cause it would definitely burn after, you know maybe more than. about 15 to 20 minutes. All right. So I'm gonna pop the rest of our pizza back into the freezer. - [Teresa] Yeah. You have. to move quick with this. - Huh? - [Teresa] You have to move. quick with this recipe. - Yeah you do or else. it's gonna melt on you. Okay. Let's do, a little caramel. Ooh. - [Teresa] Good catch. - [Bobby] Little bit of hot fudge sundae. Yeah, I'm a cat. Little bit of hot fudge sundae. Oh boy. Little bit of nuts right on top of that. That would be good to go just like that. That looks really, really. - [Teresa] But you're gonna keep going. - [Bobby] But I'm gonna keep going. And. (whip cream spraying) - [Teresa] That is real whipped cream. - [Bobby] That is real whipped cream. And my mom would say. that that is not enough. And right on top of. that, maraschino cherry. That is your cherry on top. And look how good that looks. Ice Cream Sundae Pizza. So that is one brownie mix in the box and you make it just exactly. like they tell you to do it. We used a deep dish pizza pan, spread the the brownie. mix in there really thin all across the bottom. We softened a tub of Blue Bell ice cream and spread it all over. the top of the brownie mix after it came out of the. oven and cooled a little bit. That sounds amazing. Doesn't it? And then we added to that some Hershey's Caramel and. some hot fudge topping, and a little bit of chopped peanuts and a maraschino cherry with. some heavy whipped cream. So this is definitely one of those treats for you and your family. And I'm gonna take one for the team and let you know whether. or not it is any good. Hmm. - [Teresa] You're trying to act like, you know you want the whole piece and you can't have the whole piece - That is amazing and. delicious in every way. So. - [Teresa] See Bobby, this is why it doesn't pay to be healthy. - Well happy summer everybody. Sometimes you gotta have fun in life. Mm mm mm mm.
