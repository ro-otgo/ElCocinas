there's all different kind of popcorns that you can buy out there you can buy it already bagged up pre-cooked but i just love doing it the old-timey way this really brings back some nice memories i'm gonna put just enough oil to slightly slightly cover our pan and then i'm gonna put a single layer of popcorn in the pot and you can see when i shake it up that makes like a single layer we don't want to overfill our pot because when it starts popping we could have a big mess naturally i had the pot already hot when i poured in the oil you can hear the popcorn sizzling in that oil this is dangerous because we don't know when one of those kernels are going to come flying up up there it went i remember that my mother had a popcorn pot that she used on top of the stove and it had a clear lid so we could watch it as it popped but i don't think they make those anymore but maybe i could find one at a junk shop i can't eat it fast enough don't do that at home kitties i'm just having fun and you can hear it you can hear it popping and we're just going to shake that pan because if i just left that pan sitting there there's a good chance that the popcorn might burn and we don't want that there's all different popcorns now that you can use instead of popping your own all different brands but i would recommend an unsalted popcorn for this recipe okay the pot is quiet so i think all the kernels have popped let's take a look and hopefully there's no burned popcorn on the bottom there's not one burned kernel in our pot now while our popcorn is cooling we're gonna come over here and we're gonna make our chocolate coating that's gonna just make these luscious chocolate filled popcorn balls and we're gonna start with a half a stick of butter always butter sugar cocoa corn syrup doesn't it seem like forever when you're draining corn syrup out of a bottle a pinch of salt we've got all of our ingredients in here now we're just going to bring them to a bowl and that shouldn't take very very long you know i remember my grandmother paul making these for the young children in our family i tried not to call on my grandmother very often to keep my children because i felt like she had already done her job with her children and i hated to pawn her great-grandchildren off on her but when i had to call on her she would make sure she had these popcorn balls as a snack for my children and everything would be all right she was a wonderful grandmother in fact both of my grandmothers were just the best i had one that i swear that walked around with a halo over her head and then i had another one that was spicy and i think it sometimes she had little horns coming out of hers so i had a nice variety i was most lucky the feisty grandmother's name was irene and she was the one that i spent many many years in the kitchen with and the other grandmother was nellie lou and i have fun fond memories of irene and little nelly lou this has come to a boil and the sugar's dissolved so now we're gonna add eight cups of popcorn to our pot a heaping one for good luck oh these are looking so good and if you wanted to you know you could even add some chopped peanuts or pecans to it it'd almost make it like a chocolate cracker jack wouldn't it i know those two little boys of mine sure did love these so i think tonight while we're watching the movie there'll be other little children around that'll love them just as much as mine did so we're going to let this cool for a minute and then i'm going to just mold them into their shape i've got a nice coating on our popcorn now i'm just going to pour down to our cookie sheet and let it cool for a minute so that i can touch it because it's still kind of warm look at the threads my granddaddy was aggravate me i was 15 years old and i ran to her and i said grandma he won't leave me alone and i remember her walking in and she had a sofa that sat out in the middle that floated and granddaddy was happened to be standing behind the sofa she walked out there with her hands on her hips and she said johnny i told you to leave her alone and he said i'm not bothering her well she walks out he aggravates me some more i run back and get her again and this time when she comes back into the room she said i told you john paul to leave that child alone and i mean it and she balled up her left fist knocked him for a loop sent him and the sofa flying over and i walked around the sofa and i looked down and i said i told you to leave me alone she was a sport my grandma like i said i adored both of my grandmothers they were just so entirely different and i have people say oh you're just like nellie lou and then i'll have people say oh my god you're just like irene so and these are heavenly even if you think you might be sinning cause you know popcorn it's a vegetable how bad can it be for you not not that bad it's just air [Laughter] and we all know air ain't fattening these are actually fun to do and after they cool off the children can help do this they'd have a ball doing it that's it they're ready for the movie well i've got all of our snacks ready all i have to do now is get changed and then we're off to the movie
