- Hi y'all. It's me Paula. And I have got a confession. to make to y'all. I'm gonna share with y'all today Mama's Pound Cake recipe. But for the life of me, I don't remember whose Mama it is. I can't remember if it's my Mama's or somebody, Lulu's Mama, I can't remember. Because I think this was in my very first self-published cookbook. So anyway, it's good. So I'm gonna share it with y'all today. And we're gonna start. with two sticks of butter and a half a cup of solid shortening. And we're just gonna cream that up. It's a very simple,. basic pound cake, y'all. (mixer whirring) So you can take this. with any way you want to. I'm gonna flavor it. with almond and vanilla. And I wish I had some lemon extract cause I think that's probably. what I would do today if I had it. All right, so we're gonna add our sugar (bowl clinking) And I'm just gonna cream this up. And then we have our flour, and we have five eggs and we've got one cup of milk. And we're gonna alternately, add the flour and the milk. Alternately, we're gonna. start with our flour and we're going to end with our flour. Don't ask me why, but it. makes a creamier cake so- - [Theresa] Miss Paula, don't forget that I put salt and baking. powder in the flour. - Oh, thank you, Theresa. So this was all purpose flour and it has baking powder. I think it's baking powder and salt. Yes, it's baking powder. We added a half a. teaspoon of baking powder and a half a teaspoon of salt to our all purpose flour,. which was three cups. So this is a very, very. standard pound cake recipe. Very, very standard. And I have a feeling, it. was probably my Mama's. (mixer whirring rapidly) That it was my Mama's, but it couldn't be somebody else's Mama but I don't think so. Cause it sounds so close. to my grandmother Paul's only she used, she added sour cream in. hers instead of the milk. (mixer stirring) So we wanna cream this 'till it's just kinda light. And then we're gonna add. our eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Okay. This is the last of the flour. And then, it's time for me. to choose the flavoring. How we wanna go with this cake. And Eddie said, "Almond! Almond!" And I have a tendency to agree with him. What did you use Theresa. on the one that you made? - [Theresa] The rule follower. used what the recipe said. So it's called. - And what did he call for, - [Theresa] The vanilla. - Vanilla. (laughs) - [Theresa] But now. Grandmother Paul's recipe asks for both. - Yes. - [Theresa] Vanilla and almond. - Yes, and I am going to do just that. I'm going to use two flavorings. And I have shown y'all how. to make this wonderful, wonderful homemade vanilla,. because it's so expensive. I mean, you buy a good. vanilla and it is expensive. Okay so. I wanna say, I love. the little black pieces. Can you get that? Can you see that Eddie? Have y'all ever bought ice cream that says vanilla bean?. - [Theresa] Vanilla bean. - When you get those little black flakes from the vanilla bean,. that's when I like it. All right, now I'm. going to add a teaspoon. I'm gonna fill it up real good, with almond. (laughs) This is going to tempt Michael so bad on his keto diet. So I don't think that. this is keto friendly. (mixer whirring) Okay, so I think we've. got everything in it. Don't you Theresa? - [Theresa] Oh, yes Ma'am. Now see, I could just. walk off with that bowl. - I know you could! Theresa gave up sugar for Lent, y'all. And I would forget, and. every time we'd come in here and shoot these little videos, I'd offer her something sweet. She said, "You know, I gave it up for Lent but I can have some on Easter Sunday." - [Theresa] And I was better. than I thought I was gonna be. - I know I asked her. when she came in today I said, "Well, did you kill yourself eating sugar on Easter Sunday?" And all you do is eat raw batter, right? - [Theresa] Yeah. That's not good. - Did you eat the banana banana pudding? - [Theresa] I ate the banana pudding. - Right, what did I do with my? Well Carrie, for Easter,. Carrie made banana pudding, Not Yo Mama's.. - [Theresa] Me too. - Am I getting this all. over me or is it water? And I made Grandma Hiers' carrot cake. - [Theresa] Well, I have. every friend that I know, asks for Not Yo Mama's Banana. Pudding as their birthday cake. - Really?. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - (laughs) People love it. - [Theresa] So, if you. haven't seen that video or you haven't made that, you just need to see that one too. - Uhuh. - [Theresa] Let me help you. - Please this is so heavy. - [Theresa] Why don't. I hold it and you may- - This is so heavy Theresa. - Well, how about you, let me hold it. - Wait I'm fixing the. loop. Okay I got it now. You just spin, spin, spin. Did you use this size bundt? - [Theresa] I sure did. I think I did. - [Paula] And because some. are bigger than others. Whoa. - [Theresa] Mine might have. been, a tiny bit bigger. - [Paula] Okay, oops. All right, I think, maybe, I can just start doing it this is way. - [Eddie] Oh that smells so good. - [Paula] Doesn't that almond. smell delicious, Eddie? Okay. Theresa, if you could. help me one more time, please. - [Theresa] Certainly. - And let's kinda turn. it, so we go to this side. - [Theresa] How about I hold it? - [Paula] Okay. Thank you. You want me to accidentally. leave a little batter in here? - [Theresa] Yes, please.. You don't normally. (laughing) - I know, but- - You're chintzy when it comes to that. - I know. You know, I. wanna get every piece due out of my pots. Okay. That's it. - [Theresa] Now, do you. slam that a little bit. - [Paula] Not this one. I do my layer cakes but... - [Theresa] Okay. Is there a. reason why not this one versus, or is it already dense enough? Wow. It's a very dense cake. Whoa. - [Theresa] Okay. So you. put yours in the oven 'cause they're not going. to get to see yours and then you show them mine. - Yes - [Theresa] 'Cause it's so pretty. - It is beautiful. - [Theresa] It did turn out good. - All right. And do you want me to make a glaze? Some kind of glaze for yours? - [Theresa] No. You know I like- - Because I can make a. nice little lemon glaze. - [Theresa] I got a lot. I don't need it for, for me personally, because I like it just like- - You like it plain. Okay. - [Theresa] You know why because. I'm like how you grill it. - Yes, toast it. You toast it. - [Theresa] I toast it. Are you not gonna lick your dish? - [Theresa] Yeah, not yet though. - Well, you better get or I am. - [Theresa] Eddie's gonna. go all over it too though. - That's some ever more good cake batter. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - So, (singing) it's a Betty. Crocker's cake. (laughs) - [Theresa] It's probably not going to be as pretty as yours. - [Paula] No! - [Theresa] but I'm pretty proud of it. - [Paula] This is a beautiful cake. And Michael Groover would. kill himself eating this cake because it's got that nice crust on it. And he does love that crust. So... - [Theresa] It's hard not to. - [Paula] You can actually turn it over, depending on which way. you like to look at it. - [Eddie] I like it that way. - [Paula] So does Michael.. Michael likes it this way too because he sees he's got more crust. - [Theresa] It does.. - [Eddie] Yeah. - But it's probably. prettier the other way. Especially, if you gonna make. a glaze and pour over it. - [Theresa] True. - 'Cause you need those. cracks so that glaze could... So it's totally up to you. You did a great job Theresa. - [Theresa] Thank you. I'm pretty proud. - [Paula] I'm gonna lose my job. It's what I'm gonna do. - [Theresa] We don't. have to worry about that. - She's going to be the prep cook. - [Theresa] Yep. - And the cook cooker. - [Theresa] I don't have that personality. - So which way do you want it Theresa? - [Theresa] It looks perfect that way. - Okay. It is. 'Cause that glaze, it. run down those cracks. - [Theresa] I know but I think that's it- - That glaze that you don't want. So love and best dishes y'all! Mama's Pound Cake, sure is good. I just don't know whose. mama it is. (laughs)
