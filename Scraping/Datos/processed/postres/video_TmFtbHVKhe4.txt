i'm so glad that y'all are with me because i'm going to be cooking up food that's just pure fun to eat is there anybody out there that doesn't like a candied apple i don't know of a soul that doesn't just love them and they just street party and carnival so i'm going to be making toffee apple and i'm going to start with two cups of sugar and again that humidity is kind of getting me out here i'm going to add one cup of packed light brown sugar i'm gonna add two thirds a cup of white corn syrup i'm gonna add two-thirds of a cup of butter sounds delicious doesn't it and i'm gonna add one cup of heavy cream and we're gonna cook this one until it reaches 240 degrees all right now we're going to put this on the burner and like i said i'm going to stir this until everything is dissolved again and we're going to cook this to 240 degrees now this recipe all also calls for vanilla flavoring but i'm not going to put it in right now because the alcohol and the flavor will dissipate so it's going to be really really delicious with the caramelly buttery vanilla taste now we're going to stick the thermometer in it so that we'll know it gets to 240. it's just rolling right along okay that's at 240. so we'll bring this over here and i'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla the reason i didn't add it earlier is because i didn't want the flavor to cook out of it all right we're going to give that a quick stir oh look somebody's going shrimping mmm i wish i was going oh the shrimp here on the on the coast of georgia are just out of this world they're the sweetest most flavorful shrimp the other day michael and i was out here in the backyard and the crabbers were coming in and michael did that whistle that i can't do got his attention and said you got some extras and he said yeah and he pulled over and michael bought a bushel of crabs right off his boat because we wanted to go crabbing but we just didn't have time so uh michael came out here to his kitchen and and steamed those crabs and he picked them and fed them to me they were so good um doesn't that look delicious and i think i'm gonna put nuts all over him look how good that looks look at that big boy he doesn't even want to stand up he's so big and if y'all think this one looks good just wait until you try the others now if you want to make a scrumptious caramel apple just heat up one 14 ounce pack of the cubed caramels along with two tablespoons of milk to 240 degrees it's so simple y'all but the flavor is out of this world and to make a sinfully sweet red cinnamon apple heat up two cups of sugar one cup of water a half a cup of white corn syrup a teaspoon of cinnamon and a little bit of red food coloring and in no time y'all are gonna be ready to enjoy a mouth-watering candy apple that tastes just like the one you got at the fair hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this blast from the past be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as the notification bell to be alerted when i post a video love and best dishes y'all
