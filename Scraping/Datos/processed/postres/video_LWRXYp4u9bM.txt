- Hey, y'all, today is gonna. be a fun day in my kitchen because I'm gonna be. walking down memory lane and I am with the best person in the world to walk down memory lane with. because it's my Aunt Peggy. And the sour cream pound cake, I call it Granny Paul's. sour cream pound cake. I have had a thousand. compliments on this, Aunt Peggy. I run into people all the time saying "I make that grandmother's pound cake and it's out of this world." And it's so funny 'cause. Grandma was a baker and Mama didn't do a lot of baking. She would have, Bubba and. me, warm banana pudding lots of times sitting on. the counter by the back door when we'd race in from school. And I was asking Aunt Peggy last night, "You weren't a baker, were you? Did you ever make a cake?" And she said, "No." I said, "Well, did you. ever make anything sweet?" And she said, "Yes." And I said, "What?" She said, "A chocolate meringue pie." (laughs) My Aunt Peggy,. trying to describe her. She doesn't want to do what. somebody's telling her to do. (laughs) Then I was coming. up with ways to describe it. And I was thinking free balling it. - [Eddie] No, but maybe. free spirit. Maybe. (laughs) - Free spirit. Anyway, she. doesn't like using recipes. She wants to do it her way. So therefore she's never. had any interest in baking 'cause somebody's telling her what to do and she ain't putting up with that crap. Right?. - Yes. (laughs) - (laughs) Some things never change. She's the president of. her company. (laughs) So (laughs) but listen,. she sure does enjoy them when I make them. And when grandmamma was. around and she made them, so I'm gonna have a question. to ask you in a minute. So I think I'll go ahead. and ask you now, Aunt Peggy. This cake is so beautiful. It's wonderful with just vanilla flavoring but I've got a lot of options over there in my baking cabinet of. different flavors we could use. So I would like for you to be. thinking about what flavor, if any flavor, you would. like this cake to be. We have got, let's see,. what have we got in here? (phone ringing) We've got. almond flavor, vanilla. Excuse me. Y'all I gotta let somebody in. Hello?. - Hey, it's Patty. (indistinct). - Thank you. Bye bye. (doorbell rings). (dog barks) Okay, just go tell 'em. Go let 'em in. It's so funny, Gus knows when. that phone rings a certain way that it's the gate and somebody. is coming in this house. So he's gotta go greet 'em, y'all. All right, Eddie, I'm gonna look up here and see what all kind. of flavorings we got. We got banana, we got coconut.. (dog barking) I can't even read that one.. - That's the orange. - Orange, more banana.. (dog barking) What does that one say, Eddie?. - Peppermint. - Peppermint, she doesn't like peppermint. That's red food coloring. And that's the butter one. So I'll use this with. whatever flavor she picks out. Have you decided yet?. - What flavor? - Have you decided on the flavor you want? - I didn't hear you call out lemon. - (laughs) I knew, I knew. she was gonna say that! And she's right, because. I don't think I have any lemon flavoring.. - We have fresh, fresh lemons. - [Aunt Peggy] Then your choice. - Well, if you wanted a. lemon, we've got fresh lemons and I will use those and. we can grate some zest. - [Aunt Peggy] Yes, I like all that. - Uh huh and what do you do. when you take that skin off? (laughs) Tell me what you do. - I don't like telling you. how to do things. (laughs) - (laughs) What did you call it? - Zass, did I say zass? Jest. - Jest. (laughs). - Jest, I think it was. - One day when we were. in here in the kitchen, she said, "Can you jest. me some lemon?" (laughs) And I said, "What'd you say you want me to get you some lemon?" (laughs) So that's why I asked.. (laughs) I'm sorry, y'all. I know I've embarrassed. her but I can't help it. - (indistinct). - I love to hear you say jest. (laughs) Alright, so back to business. So I'm gonna be taking a break in a second and I'm gonna jest some. lemon and get some juice up. (laughs). - Great. (laughs) - All right, now in this bowl I have three cups of plain. flour, a teaspoon of salt and lots of times I don't too much measure this stuff either. Half a teaspoon of baking. soda, not powder, but soda. I have six eggs. I have. a cup of sour cream. And I have, at room temperature,. two sticks of butter and three cups of sugar here in my mixer. So I already started. creaming them but here we go. We're gonna let that cream real good. And then we're alternating our. flour and our eggs together. But as soon as this creams, I'm gonna add the sour cream to our mix. Okay, our butter and our sugar has creamed so I have just added. one cup of sour cream. Let's see, what'd I do with my rag? There it is. All right, now we're gonna alternately add our sifted flour, salt and baking soda into our sugar and butter mixture. And we're gonna start with flour and we're gonna end with flour, y'all. And where you would normally. alternate with a buttermilk or something like that, we're gonna alternate with eggs. (dog barking). Sorry, y'all. Hush, hush it's Sullivan! Y'all don't go crazy. Crazy. All right, so there's our one egg. Hey, Sullivan, where have you been? - [Sullivan] (speaker. drowned out by mixer) - Huh? Your new house? What's going on? - [Sullivan] Nothing really. (speaker drowned out by mixer) - Nothing really? - [Sullivan] (speaker. drowned out by mixer) - Okay, well, I missed you. while you was gone. (laughs) Carly and Brian sold the home. that they were living in, y'all, and they bought a new home. Well, it's not new but they are redoing a lot, a lot of things in the house and they can't stay in. the house right now. It's not occupiable. So they are staying here with us while the work is being. done on their home. And it's gonna be. beautiful. Just beautiful. (dog barking). Hush! Hush, hush, hush! I'm telling ya, sometimes I'd like to give them a tranquilizer, Eddie. They bark so much. Not really. 'Cause sure as I'd do it, I would need for them to bark and let me know about something. All right, that's egg number three. It's looking so good. Wow, I just love watching. cake batter come together, especially when I'm using. my Paula Deen mixer. Because I sat down at the. table with my friend, Bob, and told him everything I. didn't like in a regular mixer and everything I would love to have if I could have a mixer developed. And this one is just wonderful. You can see my bowl is turning but you can also see my. beaters are moving back and forth at the same time. And I don't know if Eddie can get in there but if you could see in there, you would see a helping hand that is constantly scraping. the side of the bowl. If you come around here,. Eddie, and shoot down in there, you can see where the. bowl is being scraped. And I don't have to stop not one time to scrape the sides of that bowl. And I love that, y'all. I love that feature. All right, so the fourth egg is going in and this is gonna work. out just about perfect. But I just love seeing it come together. And the thing about my. mixer is lots of times, if you're putting a cake together,. you can get to the bottom when you're ready to. put it in your cake pan is you find just a glob. of stuff at the bottom. Well, I don't seem to have. that problem with this mixer. I just love it. All right, so we're almost there. I'm gonna let that flour get mixed in. The helping hand is the biggest, the biggest treat of all though. Because usually when I'm baking a cake, I'll have to stop, I'll. have to cut the motor. Stop, and at least eight times, I'll have to stop and scrape the bowl. And that gets very old to me. Okay, then we get the flour. Okay, I'm gonna let that turn that flour, let it get one turn. The last egg and that was a good egg. Had a lot of white to it. Did you see that egg?. - Yeah. - Okay and the last of the flour. So, Aunt Peggy, I'm gonna go ahead and add some vanilla flavoring. But then I'm gonna put some. lemon juice in there too, okay? (laughs) I wonder if I should use some of that butter extract. Smells like pure butter, why not. We'll have a buttery lemon cake. Usually, Aunt Peggy,. I put almond flavoring and vanilla flavoring in my pound cake. But I don't think Grandma did. I think she just used. plain vanilla flavoring. Ooh, it's so pretty. That's some pretty, pretty batter. Well, I'm gonna cut the mixer off and I'm gonna take a little break so y'all don't have to sit here watching me squeeze lemons and I'm gonna squeeze some lemon juice and put in this cake for our Great Great. Okay, so now we're ready. to put our cake batter into our tube pan. And I've got about a. tablespoon of zest here. Or jest, a tablespoon of jest. (laughs) Listen, my Aunt Peggy is. as smart as a whip, y'all. She is smart as a whip but she can murder the English language kinda like I can. (laughs). (Aunt Peggy laughs) I don't know where I. get that from (laughs) but Michael and I tease her all the time about her pronunciation of certain words. So anyway, (laughs) anyway. I put a tablespoon of jest (laughs) and I put about a. fourth of a cup of lemon juice. And I really do wish I. had some lemon extract to make it really more lemony. But I think what I'll do is. I'll make a lemon glaze for it and that'll kick that lemon up. I think you're gonna like it. Aunt Peggy just asked me, she said, "What if I don't like it?" I said, "If you don't like. it, don't tell me." (laughs) (Aunt Peggy laughs) I said, "But all I have. to do is look at your face and I'll know that you're lying (laughs) if you're telling me you. like it and you don't. I'll so be able to tell." 'Cause you are like your niece. or your niece is like you. Lying ain't one of our fortes. (laughs) - No, we get too much joy. out of telling the truth, - Out of telling the truth, yes. - as we see it. (laughs) - So I will be able to. tell if you don't like it. And we're gonna cook this cake on 325 for maybe 65, 75 minutes. I think Grandma said that she cooked it for about an hour and 20 minutes. I can't remember. I'll. have to look at the recipe. I'm getting every bit of that goody out. So I'm gonna leave enough. for Aunt Peggy to lick that and tell me if she tastes any lemon on it. Here, you gotta, I'm not gonna stand here and then hold it for you. (laughs) She's been here six. months, and I have to say, I think I mighta spoiled her a little bit. You think, Eddie? (laughs). (Eddie laughs) I've loved taking care of. her, during this COVID stuff. - Yeah, I was coming. for three or four weeks. - (laughs) Yes, you was. coming for three weeks, it's been six months. But she has had terrible,. terrible, terrible back and hip issues, so I kinda had. a captured audience with her. (laughs) She couldn't walk.. (Aunt Peggy laughs) And she couldn't walk,. she couldn't go home. All right, you taste any. lemon in that at all? - Yes, I do and it, so far,. the flavor to me is good but you can make a judgment. - I'll make a judgment when. you eat a piece of the cake and I look at your face. (laughs) So let's see what Grandma said. An hour and 20 minutes at 325. Let's see. Our oven is on convection, so I think I'm gonna take. that off of convection, Eddie. Because this oven, when. you've got it on convection, it's very, very hot. All right, so I'm gonna set our timer. And I will see y'all back here, probably in an hour and 20 minutes. But, y'all, it's gonna seem. like that long. (laughs) That hour and 20 minutes. just gonna fly by. (laughs) Okay, y'all, our beautiful. pound cake is ready. Grandma Paul's sour cream pound cake and Great Great asked for it to be lemon. So look at that.. - Smells wonderful. - Doesn't it smell wonderful. Well, come look at it, Great Great. Now Grandma said cook it. for an hour and 20 minutes. We cooked it for an hour and 10 minutes. Isn't that pretty?. - Mm-hmm. - What do you think about. me making some syrup, some lemon syrup water and. just pour a little of that over there to give it. that fresh lemon taste? - Mm-hmm, that'd be good. - Okay, well, let's do that.. - Good. - We'll pour on top and then. (laughs) Oh, you're welcome.. You're welcome, I love ya. So I'll get some syrup going on the stove and we'll pour it over it. Okay, friends, I have made a lemon syrup and I'm just gonna pour. some of this around there because I really am hoping since I didn't have any lemon extract and I really wanted to give it. a good, strong lemony flavor. So you just kinda wanna. do maybe equal parts sugar to equal parts water. And I took my little bitty. spoon that Eddie gave me that, I love this spoon so much, this is what I made my. holes with in my cake. And I put my lemons in and cooked them along with the sugar water. and the juice from the lemons. So we're gonna just pour. that on and let that sit and then we're gonna. take it outta the pan. And then I'm gonna make a. little lemon glaze for the top when it comes out. Oh, look, Great Great's clapping. (laughs) - I like the glaze.. - (laughs) She likes that. I like a glaze too. Look, y'all, the boys are multiplying. Another one just showed up. This is Henry. Are you number four or number five? - Three.. - Three. - Oh yeah, you're number three. - I'm second.. - No, you're not second. - You're not second!. - I'm older than John. - Well, you're not older. than me. I turned nine. - All right, Jack came first. Maddie came next, Henry name next. - Third. Then Sully. - Sully may be fourth.. - Years. - I think you came before John. - Yeah.. - Backwards. One of the ways. Anyway, there's 11 of them, y'all and I never know when. they're gonna show up. But it's just funny that. they showed up for cake time. - For cake.. - There's something very suspicious about that. (laughs) Oh, they're so sweet, y'all. So they helped me mix up a glaze for our Grandma Paul's sour cream pound cake that we turned into a lemon. pound cake for Aunt Peggy. So we have made a glaze. Well, after we did that,. I poked holes in it and I made up a lemon sugar syrup, cooked it for a while 'til it was thick, and then I poured that over the cake while it was still in the pan. But now, guys, we're gonna. spoon a glaze over it 'cause Great Great likes glazes. Just like me too. (laughs) So we're just gonna let. that run down the edges. And we made our glaze,. y'all, out of cream cheese, - Yummy.. - powdered sugar and our liquid was lemon juice. So didn't I say we put. a little cream cheese in it, Eddie?. - Yes. - [Paula] Cream cheese,. powdered sugar, lemon juice. - [Henry] That's why. it smells like lemons. - Yes, that's why it smells like lemon and I like a thick glaze, I just like for it to stick. I like for it to be thick. enough that you can see it. So I'm gonna take that now and just start kinda spooning and I let the cake get real, real cool. It's been sitting for a while. What do y'all think?. - Yummy. - What do y'all think?. - Yummy. - What do you think? Ooh.. - I don't know. - You don't know? (laughs). - It looks so good. - It does look so good. So good. - Can we help?. - Can you help? - Yeah.. - All right, can you-- - Me and Henry.. - Okay, can you take that spoon and drizzle it where you see. Whoa! (laughs) Yeah, do it, there you go. - Voila.. - Voila. All right, Henry, you get the next spoon. - Yeah.. - And just drizzle that where you think it needs it. Don't. Whoa, whoa, whoa! (laughs) Can't put it in the hole. (laughs) There ya go. - [Sully] Just drizzle it. on the bottom of the cake. - [Paula] That looks like a. cinnamon roll, doesn't it? - [Sullivan] Looks like a big-- - [Paula] Eddie makes wonderful-- It looks like a big cinnamon roll. - Cinnamon roll.. - Cinnamon. Cinnamon. - Cinnamon. Okay, I. think we've got one more. I think Guinny can get, ooh, I did. I was able to get one more spoon. Who's swallowed their tongue yet? Has anybody swallowed their tongue? - [Henry] I already licked my fingers. - [Paula] (laughs) That looks like a great big cinnamon roll. I love it, I love it. So we want a little to. fall down around the edges. See, I'm gonna just encourage. it to roll down the sides just a little bit.. - This one's rolling down all the way.. - Yeah, that's running down good, isn't it. So you just--. - Smur it. - Huh?. - Smur it. - (laughs) Smear it?. - Smur it. - (laughs) Now who. pronounces smear like that? Who have you heard say smur it? - Well, I'm country so. - (laughs) Oh, you are? I thought you were a city slicker. - Well, all right in the city but I get my accent from my mom and dad. - Oh, you get your accent. from your mom and dad? - Yeah.. - What kind of accent do you have?. - Country. - Country. (laughs) You think. your mama sounds country? All right now, boys?. - Yes. - Are y'alls fingers sticky? - No, 'cause they only got-- - Well, why don't y'all. come wash your hands anyway just for Guinny.. - Hot! Well, turn it, Henry, if it's too hot. Okay, a little lemon zest. And Great Great, come up here. and look at your cake now. Come look.. - Turn that water off, Sull. - [Aunt Peggy] Come on, come on. Come, come, come, come, come.. - Come, come, come, come. - [Henry] That lemon powder? That lemon powder, Guinny? - No, that's lemon jest.. - Lemon-ine, lemon-ine. - Aunt Peggy called it lemon jest one time and I won't let her live it down, boys. All right, come on up here. next to your Great Great and let's take a picture.. - It's called lemon-ine. - All right, get in. there in different sizes. - Are we still doing a video?. - Yes. (laughs) You know, this is just wonderful. The age difference, being in the kitchen. with the older and wiser and being in the kitchen. with the young ones that are just starting. their road to hopefully a long, healthy, happy, good life just does something to me. So I hope y'all have the opportunity, or have had the opportunity, to know what I'm talking about. Bon appetite and love and. best dishes. (laughs).
