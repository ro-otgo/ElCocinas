all right stan let's get started on your chocolate almond brickle so i'm going to move this pot stand and we can move your brickel pot up and you tell me what to do what we want to do first we want to add two sticks of butter see i knew i loved staying that are on medium heat okay we're gonna get that melted we need a cup and a half brown sugar we wanted to cook this to about 280 degrees but we want to stir it the entire time but not over stir it okay because if you over stir it it'll give it too much air in it and we don't want that either we want it to be firm but not brittly and there's a difference between brickell and brittle litany yes and i really believe there's the temperature brittle is cooked to 300 to 310 brick coal is around 280. okay oh stan there's nothing more important than a thermometer candy making bacon it's all a formula i don't really think you can take a chance on that and can you make it bacon it will a degree will really make a huge difference yeah now while we while i'm doing this paula let me get this almonds on the tray okay if i drop these on the floor that's going to be bad well we'll just pick our nuts up off the floor and keep getting it it wouldn't be the first time i have dropped this on the floor you see that how that looks almost like the praline it sure does what's that thermometer now i don't know i'm going to have to turn it around here to me all right it's almost up to 270. i would say it's at 266. you sure that mm-hmm i'm all right so you ready to take it out okay because if it gets over that it will get too hard for you okay so you're just gonna pour that for the nuts okay oh my gosh now we'll spread it evenly okay let it sit for about five minutes then we can add our chocolate our morsel and we're using milk chocolate today you want me to just sprinkle this on evenly this has got to melt so we got to put it on the chocolate chip i want to make sure you're not short on that yeah and you can change this you could do a cup and a half cup and a quarter yeah i might even like two cups if i but you know you can go with what you like you can make the thickness i got about two cups here so i don't think that hurts rules and recipes are made to be broken well they're made to fit your taste buds if you like a little more chocolate what's that look i'm just going to kind of bang that in there but we still got to get the thickness like we want it and the taste is not going to change but we want it to look pretty tupac oh okay look at this see there and we put those chocolate chips on it y'all while that that brickle was still hot so it's green mountain oh my gosh it looks delicious all right we're gonna put this in the refrigerator for 20 minutes i better do that okay now we just made stan's chocolate almond brickel look at this today stan and i are saying there's always room for chocolate yeah and this is going to be fine too see that texture i see it i see it one piece look at that can we yeah heck yeah [Music] i think we got the right amount of chocolate for sure [Music] brown sugar and butter i don't see that could be anything but good oh my god sam this might be the best stuff i've ever tasted that you've made hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this blast from the past be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as a notification bell to be alerted when i post a video love and best dishes y'all
