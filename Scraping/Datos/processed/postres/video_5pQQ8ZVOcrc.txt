- Hey, y'all! I'm over the moon happy today, because my oldest grandson. Jack is here in the kitchen - Yep. - And I think you actually asked somebody to bring you over here didn't you? - Yes I did. - Which makes it even better. - I love cooking. - I do too, but I love cooking with you. Especially cooking with you. You're old enough now, you understand it. The next age group down, they don't have any kitchen knowledge yet. You know, so you have to watch them close, but you got it going on. - Matty still likes to make. concoctions in the kitchen, which is whenever he takes. a bunch of random food and puts it all together, freezes it, and then forces me to eat it. (Paula laughs) - And he actually forces you. - I mean, it's kind of like,. - Do you eat it? - I mean, mm so good. (Paula laughs) - Well, you know, that's. the fun thing about cooking because you can just. do what appeals to you. Except in baking, because. that is definitely science. That's a formula. So you need to stick to. the recipes for that one. All right. I'm heating up our fudge sauce. This is a wonderful, homemade fudge sauce that I used to make for your daddy and uncle Bobby when they were. like five or six years old. And it's so good. And I made it for you also. Well, we are going to be making,. because I'm here with Jack. And there is how many, 4 other grandsons here. outside swimming and playing? - Yeah 4. - So Jack, if you would. beat up this yolk, please. - All right. - And then, - Do we add the milk first? - Yeah, nuh-uh, after you get it beat up. That's it. - [Ed] Tell us what we're making. - Air fryer s'mores. - [Paula] Yes! - It's going to be delicious, and then we'll go serve it. to all little boys out there. - Is that the same size? Is that the same size bowl? I was gonna give you. one a little bit bigger if you needed it. Okay. So you can put the egg in there - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] and finish it. in there or in your bowl. whichever you want. I think you made the right choice. That gives you a little bit. more playing room, doesn't it? - [Jack] Yes it does.. - [Paula] Okay. So Jack told you we were making s'mores. And these are easy s'mores because I don't have to. go out and light a grill or start a fire, turn on. the fireplace, nothing. All I have to do is turn on the air fryer. All right. So Jack has got us some egg wash and over here we have. got our egg wrappers. Some grocery stores,. they will be in produce. Some grocery stores,. they'll be in the dairy, but it's a refrigerated product. So you may have to look. a couple of places. All right, so Jack let's,. I'll demo the first one, okay? - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] If you would. just come around the edges, just like that and just moisten those when we get ready to roll them up. - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] There you go sonny boy. Just like that first one. And then we're gonna put two. tablespoons of chunky frosting. And we're just going to use. a store bought frosting. And this one's good, 'cause I like milk. chocolate and this is milk. - Me too - So we gonna put two. tablespoons in the center. You can work around that can't you baby? - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Okay, now switch sides. - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Okay Now, do you know what, in my recipe it says. use large egg wrappers. So, I don't know if they make them any larger than this or not. - Yeah, I think this is the right size. - You think, okay. Because, it would really have to be a giant one. So I don't know if we're going to need two tablespoons in each one. I don't know. I'm kind of smearing it around. That's good, precious. - [Jack] All right. - And that'll help the. rolls stick to each other. Just gonna kind of spread it out. Now we're gonna put two marshmallows - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] in each egg wrapper. Egg roll wrapper. - [Jack] Put it on top of. the chocolate frosting. - [Paula] Uh-huh. Okay. There you go, pumpkin. Yes! - [Jack] This is going to be so good. - [Paula] Yes! - [Ed] These are fancy s'mores. - [Paula] I mean they're fancy. Do you know what Jack? I'm a nut lover. So I'd love some nuts sprinkled in these. - [Jack] Oh, that'd be delicious. - [Paula] You do think so? - [Jack] I think so.. - [Paula] Okay. Let's do it. - [Jack] What nuts? - [Paula] We'll do just a few nuts. How about that?. - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] Would you rather. have slivered almonds or chopped pecans? - [Jack] I think pecans would be the best. - [Paula] Okay. And I guess we just put it around where it'll stick in the chocolate. Yes! All right. Let's see if I can roll this up. Okay. All right, we're gonna. need some more egg wash. I forgot that. I forgot that you're. going to be folding these, so we need some there. They kind of split on me. How does the egg roll people do it? Is it just like that, or do they? I can't. - [Jack] I think that'll be good. - [Paula] I've never worked. in a, oh, you know what? Those are supposed to go on the inside. I've never worked in an. Asian restaurant, y'all. All right. Watch it, Grace. Watch it, Grace. Yeah. I just missed a little. somethings, something here. - [Jack] That looks good. - [Paula] Not too bad. We're ready for the next step, Jack. All right?. - [Jack] Yep. - We're going to brush. these with our egg wash because that is going to help these graham cracker crumbs. stick to our egg roll. So see it surely, most. certainly will be, a s'mores because we got our graham crackers, we've got the marshmallows, and we've got the chocolate in there. - [Jack] So am I gonna want. to get, just these sides? - Uh-huh, all. Uh-huh, no, all of it so that - [Jack] All of it. All right. - [Paula] Yeah. Don't be scared. (Paula laughs) - [Jack] Here you go. - [Paula] Okay thank you. - [Jack] Roll it in there. - [Paula] Okay, these look great. Don't be scared to wet. it though Jack, okay? - [Jack] Yes. Ma'am. - [Paula] Because that's. what's going to help those crumbles stick to it. I want to get all my crumbs that I'm due. (Paula laughs) Don't you? - [Jack] Oh, that looks so good. - [Paula] Doesn't it look delicious? This is such a good recipe to make with one of your grand children or if you're a mother of young children. Especially if you have an air fryer and you don't have to worry about frying these up in deep grease like they do at the Asian restaurants. So you don't have to worry. about them burning themselves. Okay, we're going to need. a few more graham crackers. Teresa knew. - [Jack] Could you cook this in the oven? - [Paula] Yes. You could. You can deep fry them. This air fryer, my air. fryer is the bomb, Jack. It cooks things very quickly. Okie dokie. Jack finish getting that top. off of there for me, please. - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - And I'm going to take our, well, what's wrong with this? Why won't it work? Jack what am I doing wrong? - [Jack] Is it, is there something? - [Paula] It won't come out. - [Theresa] Do you have to turn it? - Yeah. - Don't squirt yourself in the eye. Accidentally. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. It's child proof, y'all. All right. Did you see something on there. that told you that, Jack? - [Jack] No ma'am. - [Paula] Oh, look.. - [Jack] Yeah, that's good. - [Paula] Now, that's the ticket. Whoops. I'm going to take uh oh! I'm gonna take this one back. out and coat him some more. Look, that one's so torn Jack. It's going to ooze out everywhere. - [Jack] Yeah. - [Theresa] Those are the best. - [Paula] Yep. By spraying those, Jack, it's. gonna help them get crispy. Why don't you spray. - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] And I dip. How about that? - [Jack] All right. I can do that. - [Paula] Yay. I sure do like putting. them in those crumbs after it's been sprayed. 'Cause that's the way we really getting some Graham crackers. - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Here you go, baby. Look, see that didn't even. look like it had any on it with just the egg wash did it Jack? Okay. In the oven. How long in the air fryer? - [Jack] Five minutes on each side. So you wanna cook it for Five minutes - At what temperature? - And then flip it over. At 400 degrees. - [Paula] Okay. - [Jack] Five minutes. - Okay. Five minutes. We'll turn them over. And we sprayed all sides. So we may not have to. spray them again, Jack. But we'll see, okay? - Okay. - They look so good. And listen, now my last step, I am telling y'all to. drizzle it with chocolate, but look at this. I'm not gonna have to. do much drizzling, am I? (Paula laughing) Because Jack and I made them so fat, but we're still going to just drizzle them with some of our homemade. chocolate fudge sauce that Theresa made. - [Theresa] And you told. them that's a video, right? If they want to go on. - [Paula] No, I didn't. - [Theresa] Oh yeah, we made that. - [Paula] Yes, on a video. - [Theresa] On a video, another video. - [Paula] And this is so easy to make. - [Theresa] And so worth it. - [Paula] Theresa was just flabbergasted. The first time she ever saw me make it. She said, it's that easy? Yeah. - [Theresa] And it's that decadent. - [Paula] And it's that decadent. So just a little drizzle. (Paula laughing) Just a little drizzle. I like a little drizzle. Just a little drizzle. Shut up, Paula and get. those on out of there. I just can't seem to get. enough on those right there. - [Ed] I think you, - [Paula] You think I've drizzled out? - [Ed] I think you're past drizzling. You may have just, - [Paula] surpassed. - Mm. What do you think, Mr. Ed? Mr. Ed, he was talking a horse wasn't he? Of course. All right. - [Theresa] And there she goes again. - [Paula] So just to make it official. Since I dropped a little. fudge sauce on the edge, we'll just fix it. Like it was supposed to be there. - [Theresa] Yum. - Looks good enough to. eat doesn't it y'all? All right. Let's take this outside because I've got five. hungry, young men out there. Y'all there's nothing better than feeding your grandchildren. Maybe cooking with them. A lot of fun too. But, makes me so happy, - [Child] Thank you Guinea.. - to get in my kitchen and fix something that my grandchildren. They think Guinea's a genius. - [Child] How'd you make this? It's so good. - Best dishes and love y'all.
