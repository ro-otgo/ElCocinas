some of my oldest and dearest friends are coming to spend the weekend with michael and me so i'm gonna make a french coconut pie now i've got a half a stick of melted butter here in my saucepan and i'm gonna add some sugar and a little bit of flour and a cup of grated sweetened coconut a couple of eggs and i'm just gonna mix this up and then my last ingredient that i'm gonna add is milk that phone has been ringing off the hook this morning my phone almost never rings but it's been ringing like crazy this morning that's always the way it is though when you're busy and don't have time to talk on the phone you're trying to get ready for company trying to get everything done and that's when everybody decides they're gonna call you all right now we've got our custard mixed up i'm just going to pour this into our store-bought pie shell i'm going to put this in a preheated 400 degree oven and i'm going to walk ever so gently with this pie i mean it's full isn't it y'all but i'm gonna bake this probably between 45 50 and 60 minutes i think we made it and you can see i've got a bowl of fresh whipped cream here and i've got another pie that's cooled back here i just love that the pie is nice and cool and the thing i love about this pie is you don't have to refrigerate it i'll just put it under a glass dome and so it'll be right there on the counter for the girls and they won't even have to look for it it'll just be there waiting on them if you'll take your scissors and just snip through that foil just like that and you can see it will lay down allowing you to get your spatula underneath it and it comes out perfectly i'm going to put just a little taste of whipped cream on my piece of pie and i don't know about y'all but i love coconut and chocolate together and then we've got this coconut pie i love it love it love it we're going to gain weight this weekend i can just feel it hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this video be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as a notification bell to be alerted when i post a video loving best dishes y'all
