- I'm in here with one of our grandsons. This is Sullivan Brooks. - Hey. And he is here visiting last week before you start school, right? - Yes Ma'am. And then you're going. back to Birmingham when? In the morning? - Yes Ma'am 6:00 AM. - Oh, I'm gonna miss you so bad. So Sullivan has been. wanting to get in here and help me make some things. So I have got a recipe in. cooking with Paula Deen magazine. Do you ever a cook out of my magazine? - Sullivan? - No, ma'am - Okay Good. - But my mom does. - But your mom does. That's important. So we are gonna make this. blackberry coffee cake with the strudel topping. Cause y'all will love that. for breakfast in the morning. Before you take off at six o'clock this is something you. can carry along with you. All right. So the first thing we're gonna. do is the strudel topping. Sullivan, So if you'll take this bowl and you see all these things right here? That's cinnamon, brown sugar, flour, and more sugar. So if you'll just mix. those four things together and use that fork to fluff 'em up. And while you're doing that, I've got. This recipe is like in kind. of three sections y'all. And you just fluff that. with your fork and it'll, it'll be so good on top of these black, this Blackberry coffee cake. So I've got my flour, I've got salt. I have got baking powder here. And what I have here is. that a little, what is that? What is it? Do you recognize that smell? I think it's one of the. things that you like. Ginger. Don't you, you don't like ginger. Well, I'm sorry I thought you did. - I only like ginger ale. - Ginger ale, okay. So are you excited to get back to school? - Kind of but kind of not. - And you gonna be in the fourth grade? - Yes ma'am. - I can't believe it. It was like yesterday you were born. It's hard to believe Sullivan. And you going back and. you playing football. Yes Ma'am. - All right. Now I have. mixed up my flower base. - Is this good? - That is very good. Thank you so much Sullivan. All right. let's see. Now we're gonna need our electric mixer, because we are gonna cream our butter and our sugar together. And do you wanna man, the, the mixer? - Do I just press this? - Let's put it in here. and look, see up there? It says uh-oh, somebody's. turned off our power. And it's strong Sullivan. It's real strong. So just cream that up real good. Going good. It's going real good. I'm gonna go ahead and. add our vanilla flavoring and that'll help, I'll help you mix it a little bit better. Let's see if we can turn. it up just a little bit. (laughing) That's getting it ain't it. Well you had a good time these four days since you been home? - Yes Ma'am. - What been your favorite thing to do. - Seeing my friend Wesley. - And your cousin? - Yes Ma'am. - You got You got - Oh and going to eat at. that Georgia fried catfish at your restaurant. - Yeah. We ate The lady. and Sons yesterday. And wasn't it so good. Sullivan wanted catfish. And the rest of the guys. wanted chicken, fried chicken. So we got a little of both. All right. Now here's what we're gonna do Sully. We're gonna cut this off. And we're gonna, we're gonna get our spatula and go around here and. push everything down. So it'll get mixed up real good. So now we are gonna. take our flower mixture that we have made and we've got our milk. And we are gonna begin with. flour and end with flour. Okay? So if you take your mixer and be mixing that and. I'll add our flour, okay? - I'll turn it up to two. - Wait, let's turn it, start at one right now. There you go. I can't see all that well. I see things that are not there. (laughing) There you go. Go all around the edges. And now I'm going to add. a little of your milk. Perfect. All right, now I'm gonna. add some more flour. This is gonna be delicious and Sullivan, You know, miss Emily, the lady. that does my hair and makeup? She, her family grows. blackberries where they live and she brought me a great big bucket. Their fresh black berries. So that's what we're gonna use. I'll put 'em in the freezer. so we could have 'em later. So that's what we're gonna have. So we've got all the ingredients in there. I'm going to reach in. here and get the spray. So it won't stick. Just so it won't stick. Just a little bit. All right. So the first thing we're. gonna do, Sullivan, is we're gonna take our cake part and put it into an eight by eight pan. And we gonna make sure. this is spread out evenly. - So we can put our blackberries in? - Yes. And you wanna do that part? - Yes. Ma'am. - I'll do this part if you'll. do the Blackberry part. - Okay. - Okay just spread that out. This is gonna be delicious. I love coffee cake with coffee. - Especially. It's so good. - Am I allowed to have it? - What? - This - Oh, yes. No, no this doesn't have coffee in it. That's just what it's called. - Oh. - Coffee cakes. It's, it's cakes that people. like to have with their coffee. - Oh yeah. - Okay. So there you go. Our blueberries, our. blackberries are frozen. - Do I just dump it or. - Well, you could do it to make it even you could just do it, kind of like that. How about that? - Okay. - And look at your friends. You got your friend here, Wesley and you got your cousin, - Sup - [Paula] John here. What's up. (laughing) - [Sullivan] We use the whole thing? - [Paula] Yes. We're going. to use every bit of it. These are big blackberries. Like I said, miss Emily. Huh? Beautiful fresh blackberries. - [Sullivan] Yummy. - [Paula] Mm. So yummy. - You know, you have to be careful if you're out picking blackberries, cause you know snakes hang around blackberry bushes. Because the blackberries attract the birds and the snake is sitting there waiting for a bird to come along. So if you're ever picking blackberries you have to keep a close. eye out cause snakes. - Can I dumb that in? - Yes. You can do that. And we've got our oven set. to 350 degrees Sullivan and we are gonna bake it for, I don't know maybe 45 minutes or until it comes out, you know clean. The toothpick that we stick in it. - [Eddie] The blackberries. froze up pretty good. They didn't, they didn't. get diss-formed or anything. - [Paula] Oh no. They're just beautiful. - [Sullivan] I use all of this? - [Paula] Yes. Get around here too. Make sure you got some strudel everywhere. I hope that y'all have had. an opportunity this summer. You mama's and grand-mama's out there. I hope y'all have had a chance to get in the kitchen with your. grandchildren and cook with them, because it really is a. wonderful way to make memories with your grandchildren. - That's what I do. I do with you and Mimi. - Oh good. - Every single time I. go to a lake with her. - What do y'all fix? - Either barbecue sandwiches or brownies. - [Paula] All right so, I think this'll be a lot better. - [Sullivan] Yeah. Buttery. - [Paula] dotted with the butter. Don't you? - [Sullivan] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Yes sir. Buddy. Miss Theresa was holding out on us. - [Theresa] Didn't mean to. Didn't mean to she said. Okay. There we go. You wanna put all these. dishes in the sink, Sullivan. - Yes. Ma'am. - while I get this in the oven. - Here I can get that. - Okay. Well there, we needed Miss Theresa. So guys, I'll see y'all back here in the. kitchen in about 45 minutes. Okay? And we're gonna taste. your great sous chef- Helpers ran off on me y'all and I told him, I said, I'll, I'll wait. Cause Sully said, can John. and Wesley be in it too? I said, yes. Y'all can all finish up with. me, taste it and finish it up. Well they left. So we may have to add a little bit more to this when they get back Eddie. I don't know how long. they're gonna be gone. - [Female Voice] I see Eddie. and I having a piece too. So we will have to really. figure out that one. - Oh Emily, thank you so. much for those blackberries. They're so good. I can't see a Blackberry without thinking about my grandma Paul and. all the blackberry cobbler she cooked in her lifetime. - [Female Voice] That was sweet. That was easy. - Mm. So easy. So good. Real good. Are my teeth purple. Now I gotta try to even this out where I dug into it. I think y'all will like it.
