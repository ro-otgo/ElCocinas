thank you my friends for hanging uh out with me as we walk through these 12 days of christmas cookie recipes i hope it's kind of getting you in the christmas spirit uh because this year is it's kind of a challenging emotion uh since we've been advised to keep our groups really small and maybe not be around as much family as we're used to in the holidays but um hopefully just sitting back and baking cookies with me will ease a little bit of the pain and we'll just have fun and we'll laugh and think what christmas is going to be next year i'm ready to see 2020 gone all right y'all i have added uh like three-fourths of stick of butter and then this is butter flavored solid vegetable shortening and this is my white sugar and actually i started with uh this is three quarters of a cup of sugar and we've got a quarter cup over there for us to roll our snickerdoodles in so we're just gonna cream this um butter and sugar together i'm gonna lower that until i get it kind of wet you know i think this is one of it's such a simple cookie but i think it's one of people's like favorites now this snickerdoodle is a little different because it's a pecan snickerdoodle we're gonna put some chopped finely chopped pecans in it and then um as you get them on your baking sheet you'll want to take some extra pecans and put them on top and kind of press them in to make sure they don't fall off but i'm not gonna be able to do that step because we ran out of nuts around here can you believe it i'm nuts that's not his bed is running out of butter y'all okay now i'm safe to turn this up and get that creamed real good and this dough does not make a whole bunch y'all so if your family is crazy about snickerdoodles you may want to double the recipe all right we're going to add our one egg and uh this recipe y'all i don't know if you have my newest book with this uh paula deen southern bacon book this recipe came out of my last book and oh my goodness that cookbook if you like bacon it has some of the most wonderful recipes in it that you will ever put in your mouth i'm really proud of my first bacon cookbook there are some wonderful recipes in there that are great for like say christmas morning brunch or breakfast all right that's probably about a teaspoon of vanilla now over here i've got a flour and i've got cream of tartar i've got baking soda and i've got baking powder so we're just gonna this is like sifting when you use a whisk this just feels just like i'm sifting that flour [Music] okay so now we're gonna just add a flower in maybe like three different three different locations okay that's one yeah we'll get it in there in three and three editions and this is a thick batter too y'all which is good because we're gonna scoop this up and we're gonna uh roll it into balls and then we're going to roll our balls in the uh spices that makes these a snickerdoodle makes it so good you know this is such a it's a very unintimidating cookie like you know you know some people that are just like salt of the earth people no pretense no heirs that's what a snickerdoodle is like okay it looks crumbly doesn't it all right so i got my fourth of a cup of sugar and i can't remember how much cinnamon i use let me see two teaspoons of cinnamon so just to keep my cookie about the same i'm gonna use my little scoop of pooper pooper scooper oh no we don't want to call it that do we okay so i'm just rolling it in our cinnamon sugar mixture and then i'm going to flatten it a little bit and like i said this is the oh i forgot to add my nuts so this is the point where i would add extra nuts like that and just stick them in so i'm going gonna fold these nuts in i'm glad i i'm glad i said something talking about our nuts cause i was just before leaving them out okay i love that brown cinnamon on them these are still crumbly and hopefully the warmth of my hands will help it stick together there we go yeah this is like so crumbly i have trouble following my own directions i forgot to tell y'all to refrigerate your dough for about one hour so i'm gonna pretend like i did that but it'll just work it'll work up better for you if it's been refrigerated so these are gonna be perfect okay our bell just rang for our pecan snickerdoodles there they are the salt of the earth cookies oh i got a little piece of red on that one i got food coloring all around here honey i don't know uh i'm up to my eyeballs and everything but nuts so these are our wonderful snickerdoodles and like i said they're just good old salt of the earth cookies no pretense just like i like them one cookie down y'all loving best dishes hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this video be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as the notification bell to be alerted when i post a video love and best dishes y'all
