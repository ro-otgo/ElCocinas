hey y'all i'm paula dean and whether you prefer sugar or spice i'm gonna make everything nice with some of my favorite desserts that are so delicious but before i get started let's run to plains georgia the peanut capital of the world for some of their freshly creamed peanut butter and then we're gonna head back to the kitchen where i'm gonna put bob's peanut butter pie recipe to test taste test that is and today we're making the cream of my cheesecake crops smothered in a syrupy praline sauce and if that's not sweet enough i'm gonna spice it up with my crunch top apple pie that's sure to please so y'all bring your sweet tooth cause life's about to get even sweeter if y'all are aware or not but i went to plains georgia and had the most wonderful chat with one of our presidents jimmy carter had such a wonderful time and as you know planes is all about peanuts for today's show i think we ought to go back to plains and get some peanuts and maybe even some peanut butter because today it's all about sugar and spice and everything nice just what us little girls are made of so y'all come with me we're gonna have a nutty day today [Music] hey bobby hey paula how you doing again fine it's so good to see you i hadn't seen you since i was here to chat with the president good how'd the cat go oh gosh it was just fabulous hey i'm here for another reason today though i heard about your peanut butter bobby what makes your peanut butter so much better our peanut butter is an all-natural snack him with fried peanuts ground up into peanut butter everything in here is a good plate well i'm thinking about making a pie i got a couple of recipes for peanut butter buys i've got a great peanut butter pie recipe would you share it with me i certainly will we used to serve this in our restaurant whenever we was here in plains so this is a great peanut butter pie recipe you know that you could use if you like well i can't wait to get to my kitchen and make that pie i appreciate so much you give me the peanut butter and the recipe thank you thank you bobby i'll see you next time [Music] well did y'all have fun visiting planes such a pretty little town and the carters are so nice and wanting bobby just cute as a pig's ear i was just thrilled to get his homemade peanut butter but when he said well paula you want a recipe too i said you bet i do baby what a bonus so we're gonna be making bobby's peanut butter pie later on but first we're going to start with a cheesecake so let's get going now we're going to start with graham cracker crumbs and a little sugar and a little melted butter i just love my little cast iron skillet for melting my butter in all right so we're just going to mix that up and moisten all of those crumbs in there with that butter so we're just going to dump those into our pan kind of get it distributed and press it down okay so we got that in there nicely so we'll move on over to the center of our cheesecake and we're going to start with three eight ounce packages of cream cheese this is gonna make a big fat cheesecake all right we're gonna put a cup of sugar and we're just gonna beat this until it's creamy make sure our beaters are in there right and they are now we're going to add five eggs and i'm going to add those one at the time giving them an opportunity to get worked into that cream cheese and sugar all right now we're putting the eggs in it because it's going to make it cake-like because you know we're not putting any flour in this particular recipe some recipes actually call for like a fourth of a cup of flour but we're putting in none in this one all right so we're just gonna mix that up good we're gonna add a tablespoon of vanilla which is just gonna flavor it perfectly and we're ready to go i'm gonna raise my beaters slowly leaving it running just ever so low to kind of sling that batter off of those that helps clean our beaters off now we're going to pour it into our crust oh doesn't that look good it's just as smooth as a baby's behind now we're going to get this in the oven and we're going to let that bake for about 45 minutes and then we're going to pull it out let it cool for a minute and we're going to top it with one of my favorite ingredients in the whole world sour cream so i've got one that should be ready over here for the topping so let's give it a check oh and it is it's ready look at that nice cheesecake and see where it's got a little crack around the edges letting us know it's ready so i'm going to sit it right here while we stir together our sour cream and i wouldn't recommend using a light sour cream i would go ahead since you're having cheesecake and do the full strength sour cream and then we're going to add a little sugar and a little vanilla flavoring and this doesn't require a mixer we're just going to stir that sugar into our sour cream now i'm just going to take this and pour it over the top of our cheesecake and we're gonna run it back in the oven for an extra five minutes so that sour cream can kind of set up on top of our cream cheese now we're just gonna spread that around evenly and that five minutes in the oven is just gonna let that sour cream kind of set up all right we're gonna let that bake for five minutes and when we come back i've got one that's cooling in the window and ready for that sinful praline sauce so y'all grab your cup of coffee and come right back cause the best is yet to come [Music] okay i've got this cheesecake in the window that's totally totally chilled there's a nice little breeze this morning so it is totally cool i'm gonna sit it right here and we're gonna make that sinful praline sauce to go on it won't take it but a minute to make i'm gonna use oh about two tablespoons of packed brown sugar oh i'm gonna do just a little extra and then i've got ordinary corn starch and this is gonna tighten up our rayleign sauce so it'll stick to that cheesecake we're going to kind of mix that together quickly and then we're going to add one cup of dark corn syrup mmm that's gonna give us a nice caramely praline look to our sauce and we're just gonna cook this just long enough for the cornstarchy taste to dissolve and the sugar and while that's getting hot and bubbly i'm going to come over here and i'm going to just do a light chop to these pecans we don't want to ground too fine because you want to know that you're actually eating a pecan on top of that cheesecake just like that that's probably about a half a cup and when we take it off i'm gonna add some vanilla flavoring but i've already got some here that's cooled and ready for our cheesecake look how delicious this looks that caramel in that pecan oh it's gonna be so good all right we're gonna just gently remove that ring i just love cheesecake i love coming to work every day all right i'm gonna ease up there perfect cheesecake whoops that won't hurt it though all right this is nice and bubbly so i'm gonna turn it off all right here we go get set go and you see where i messed up that plate i think i know just what'll fix it we're gonna cover that up with just a little bit of sweetened fresh cream does that look delicious or what i wish you were here michael too bad it's unbelievably wonderful i'm gonna sit that right there and now let's move on to bobby's peanut butter pie i'm gonna take an eight ounce package of cream cheese and i'm gonna give it just a quick little beat to get it creamy and smooth all right now i'm going to take just 4x powdered sugar and add that right now i'm going to cut that off and i'm going to put a cup of bobby's peanut butter in it and this is a natural peanut butter it doesn't taste like your store bought all right there we go and i'm going to just add that to the cream cheese give that a quick whip down in southwest georgia peanuts are a very high commodity in fact mr jimmy started selling peanuts on the streets of plains when he was four years old so he realized the value of this nut very early on in his life now all we have to do at this point is fold it into our heavy cream now if you wanted to i guess you could use a refrigerator type topping but the fresh cream really makes it good so just going to fold that together into that whipping cream and we're going to put it into a store-bought graham cracker crust so we're just going to pile that in there all right we've got this one piled high full of that peanut butter and cream cheese and heavy cream and we're going to stick it in the refrigerator and just let it set up which won't take long in fact i already have one that's ready right here for us to pull out and look at and possibly even sample doesn't that look good it's got a nice brown look to it see how it cuts oh it cuts beautifully and i'm just gonna cut me a little little tiny piece doesn't that look yummy looks delicious and i'm going to sprinkle it with just a few peanuts just a few extra and put me a dollop of cream on it looks like this one turned out just perfect so good bobby thank you gene so much for writing down this recipe for me y'all don't go anywhere because next i'm gonna be baking up a crunchy topped hot apple pie so i'll see y'all in a minute [Music] [Music] now i've just taken my first apple pie out of the oven and i'm going to sit it here in the window and let it cool and if y'all will come back into the kitchen because i want to show you how easy it was to make america's favorite pie the apple pie i wish y'all were here to smell how delicious that pie smells so easy though you can have your one in the oven just in a jiffy i'm gonna start by using rome apples and i'm gonna squeeze about a tablespoon of lemon juice over them to just keep them from turning dark and i'm gonna use about three fourths a cup of sugar and to that we're going to add one tablespoon of flour a pinch of salt and some ground cinnamon and we're gonna just gonna stir that up one of my buddies her name's julia christian uh she gave me this recipe she said paulie you gotta try this it's just my favorite of all the apple pies and i did and i love it because it's we actually put apple sauce in it which makes it so good so we're going to toss our apples into our sugar and flour and get those apples nice and coated with that sugar ooh i can smell the lemon and the cinnamon all right now we're just gonna add our apple sauce which really is just a little different from your ordinary apple pie we're just gonna give that a little stir doesn't that look yummy all right i'm gonna let that sit there a minute because i want to talk to you about your pie crust you probably hear me saying all the time i really love the refrigerated dough now i've taken one section and i have put it in our pie plate and you see i'm using a deep pie plate for the apple pie today and we're just going to take that and pour it into the raw crust because this is going to bake long enough for your crust to actually get done on you i'm going to just make sure that apple sauce is distributed all around there and i'm gonna dot it with some butter just season up those apples just a little bit okay now we're gonna put a lattice crust on this pine it's so very simple we're going to take an extra round of dough now this is on parchment paper so it won't stick on me now i'm going to take my knife and i'm going to run it down into my flour so the dough won't stick to our knife we're just going to cut us some strips now if you like wide lattice you can cut them wide if you like a narrow lattice you can cut them more narrow all right so we're gonna start with the outside of our circle and i'm gonna use five strips now latticing is very very simple i'm gonna pull every other strip back and lay a piece of crust in there and then fold that back over so you see i've got three strips under two strips over all i'm going to do now is take the three strips that are under bring them back and come in there with another piece bring them back over and then do the same thing again with another strip as it looks like it might be hard but it's not at all and we have a latticed pie crust now i'm going to come in and just take the edges and trim them up to fit our plate now before we put that in the oven we are going to make a crunch topping for it very very simple to do we're going to take some flour some sugar and just a pinch of salt and then we're going to cut in some butter until it's kind of crumbly just like we were making biscuits and then we come come over here and just sprinkle this on top of our pie all right now we're going to slip this into the oven which has been preheated to 425 degrees we're going to let it bake for about 10 minutes and then we're going to lower the temperature to 350. but this one in the window should be ready for you and me to taste and you know i don't believe that we can have a piece of apple pie without some vanilla ice cream so you see i got my scoop right ready but i'm gonna go ahead and cut into this one and get it on the plate and while i'm getting this ready i want to tell you how southerners love their apple pie when i was a little girl and my mother would make apple pies she would always pull out the cheddar cheese grate that put it on top of the slice of apple pie and run it under the broiler and we would have cheese topped apple pie that was so delicious but i'm going to serve this first piece with vanilla ice cream doesn't that look good you can see all the applesauce oozing out of there y'all think i got me enough ice cream i hope this is gonna work out right doesn't that just look yummy it's too good and too simple i gotta take a quick break and when i come back i'm gonna share some bacon tips with you so y'all don't leave me now [Music] there's so many varieties of apples out there it can almost confuse one but if you'll stick with an apple that has a lot of sugar in it that will help it hold its shape and for your apple pies i recommend the rome apple the granny smith or the golden delicious all these will work out real real well for your pie and for those big old cheesecakes if you're having a cocktail party and everybody just wants a little bite just downsize them into your mini muffins and people will think you're just wonderful and awfully awfully sweet i hope that y'all sugar and spice day will be as sweet and spicy as mine's been i hope that you'll try the cheesecake recipe just lathered with sour cream and the praline sauce and of course bobby and jeans peanut butter pie is just out of this world and the crunch top apple pie is just so delicious in fact i've got some with some melted cheese on it that i've just got to taste you just need to try this because cheese and apples just go together my mother may not be with me today but she'll forever live in my heart and on that note america i wish you best dishes from my kitchen to yours
