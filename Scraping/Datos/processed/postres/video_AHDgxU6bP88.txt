all right i'm getting this tart ready for the beach and this is another one of those easy simple but delicious recipes now i was just chopping my pecans because i'm actually gonna press those down into our crust because they're just so good uh in the crust of this tart now i'm just putting flour into the food processor and this is powdered sugar and we can't have a tart without a little butter all right all right i'm going to pulsate it and we're going to hit this until it just forms a ball all right you can see the way it's formed itself into a ball so it's ready to take out of there and y'all be careful when you're removing your blades from your food processor because you're terribly sharp all right now i want to talk about my pan for a minute this is actually a quiche pan slash tart pan and the bottom comes out so you're not going to be messed up when you go to remove your tart from the pan and this is nonstick so i'm not even gonna spray it and i actually don't think it would need a lot of spray anyway because of all the butter all we're gonna do is just put this in the pan and pat it out the important thing is to get your crust even and get it pushed back into the little waves all right so i'm just going to sprinkle those pecans around i'm just going to spread them out all right our pan's ready now i'm going to put this into a preheated 350 degree oven and we're gonna bake this for about 10 to 12 minutes so i've got one that's already cooled over here and we're going to finish putting it together see how pretty it browned and i can push up the bottom and you can see we're not going to have any problems you know sometimes when you make pies and you go to cut that first piece it's so hard to get out well this is just real real simple in the tart pan now all we're going to do is take two three ounce packages of cream cheese and some powdered sugar and we're going to cream those together now you'll want your cream cheese to be at room temperature so it won't be so hard to beat okay dope and this is just powdered sugar all right now we're gonna turn this on and i'm actually gonna cover that just for a few minutes so that powdered sugar won't go everywhere all right now while that's beaten up i've got some whipping cream some sweetened whipped cream that we're gonna fold into this and put it into our tart pan all right so i'm going to blow it out for a minute and try to keep that powdered sugar in there yeah and it's coming along our cream cheese actually could have been maybe just a little bit softer all right all right so we're just going to fold in our whipped cream until we get that nice and incorporated and it may take a minute because that cream cheese is a little stiffer than the whipped cream okay now i've got the cream cheese incorporated so we're just going to come over here all right we're just going to spread that over those nice toasted pecans now you can pack this up and take this to the beach just like this and it might transport easier if you do it this way and then when you get there you can add your blueberry pie filling to the top of it i can't wait that long this is an ordinary blueberry pie filling so doesn't that look delicious all right we've got this all ready and i'm going to stick this one in the refrigerator and let it set because that whipping cream is still just a little soft but i've got another one ready right here oh my goodness that's so pretty and let's see how easy this one's gonna come out look at that and that grate is actually prettier than a pie isn't it i just love doing tarts once in a while oh and i'm gonna have to sample this one and i'm gonna be very very careful okay i think i've gotten him pretty loose all right let's see if we have any luck getting him coming out clean um and i don't know why i'm bothering garnishing him you know i'm fixing to have me a piece i think i'm gonna put a little whipped cream on top of him oh a quick easy cross between a cheesecake and a pie oh that crust was nice and crispy it's just delicious i just love those pecans hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this blast from the past be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as the notification bell to be alerted when i post a video love and best dishes y'all
