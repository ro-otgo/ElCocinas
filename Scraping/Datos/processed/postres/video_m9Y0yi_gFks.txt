look who just walked in my kitchen this guy knows how to make candy y'all stan is the owner of savannah candy kitchens and stan's cooking up something special it's pecan pralines you know you can't think of a candy without good old lollipops and we'll be making peanut butter cups in a blanket and to top it off it's a banana split with a brulee twist so y'all get your sweet tooth ready cause today i'm turning my kitchen in to the sugar shack the stand is fixing to break down and give away the recipe for the number one candy that's sold in savannah candy kitchen and that's his pralines that's right we've been making it 30 years paula 30 years and we're going to use the same recipe that i've made it for at home before we started selling it for retail uh-uh but you're going to be you're the master and i'm your puppet baby i've been waiting for this give me two cups of sugar okay that's your hookup all right now let me know when you want to cut your stove on because i'm going to hold it all in before we cut it on okay i've got your eyes over here that'll turn that stove on good okay so two cups i need a cup of half and half cream a cup and a half all right just go ahead and just pour it in yeah pour it in okay and i need a eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda okay and that's the ingredient nobody knows about really what's the recipe now that's soda not powder that's correct right an eighth of a teaspoon okay there you go and then however much butter you want to put in it cause i'm gonna [Laughter] when i'm cooking any recipe out of your cookbook i follow the directions when i use somebody else's i've double the rest butter recipe so give us about a third of that stick and we'll make it a little buttery than normal just a third because it's yours wow okay now let's get the heat on it okay i want you to use a medium heat because this cream will uh certainly scorch if you don't keep it moving okay and you want to stir this and this is something you cannot stop stirring you got to stir it the whole time so if you can talk in a stir you can have this job if you cannot you just won't work i can talk and stir i can i can multitask oh you want me to do well oh okay this will take about 15 minutes so i'll keep you busy for a while and we're going to cook this to the softball stage which is about 238 or 240. okay now i like to cook it just to shade more than that and i can do it by eye because we've done it so much but if you don't know what you're looking for you need to have that thermometer okay there you go okay stick that in it's gonna move really quick right now keep it stirred am i not stirring oh you fine i just can't see we got glasses yes i do take that spoon oh you got to keep stirring i'll stir it to you okay keep stirring oh a shoe honey i keep glasses all over my kitchen well i can see them goosey good that must be 2.75 you know as a kid growing up i remember my mother's thermometer it just seemed like i could read hers better than i can the ones today i think it's because you had kid eyes that may be it i got 230 right now i want to get to 240 241. you see it beginning to look a little more like candy though sticking to the sides that's the sign that is coming in our direction it looks like it's getting um thick yup kind of thick that's what we want it to do okay now why are we doing this since she's a butter queen okay how about buttering this marble over here okay how much butter do you want i want a good and thick coat because it won't stick the first time i ever made these paula in the store was in april we had to tour homes in savannah and i had it cooking like this in a bigger pot and i had people just smelling it and lining it up uh-huh oh gosh i bet you and i started dipping them i was so excited then i tried to take them up and they wouldn't come up they just fell apart i didn't know you had to butter the marble that was 30 years ago so they crumbled and we still sold them so i knew that oh i'm good i bet that's how you came up with the idea because when you go in to stay in store you can get samples i always get a sample so i bet you that's where that came from with little pieces in the beginning uh-huh the little pieces in the beginning that's good butterqueen that'll do it oh that's good well save it over here i just i'll just put this in my pocket you remember when you were later oh man now seeing now that's tearing good see that you can forget that thermometer if you get that look right there well that's great now we got to add the nuts add the pecans yes let's use a cup and a half about a cup and a half okay now we're cooking oh oh my goodness let's get it off even a little bit of heat these are beautiful here take that rag stand so you won't well i'm gonna hold that like that for you okay then you dip it okay in the size that you want don't don't say that to paul i don't have a praline this big honey all right look at that isn't that gonna be pretty is that a praline or is that a praline the collar is beautiful stan those are pretty bald oh staining so we're gonna let these cool for a minute it takes about five minutes and then we'll be able to pull them right off that's not bad well why don't we just take a quick break for a minute give these a chance to cool and when we come back staying the candyman is going to feed me one of these wonderful pralines so y'all don't go anywhere we've got more things coming out of our sugar shack kitchen today coming up it's lollipops y'all and later peanut butter cups in a blanket and bruleed banana split

before you worked me the last time i'm gonna work you this time all right so we're gonna put in our pan three-fourths of a cup of white sugar you know suckers are nothing but pure sugar stand i think that's probably why children like them so much all right and that's a fourth of a cup measure so there we go now i'm gonna take my measuring cup and i'm gonna give it a little spray because you know how sticky corn syrup can be so by spraying that i'm gonna measure a half a cup all right there we go all right now look i'm gonna show you something look how easy because we sprayed this look how easy that syrup's coming out of there but you know just to give it a little push we can do that but when you get the whole thing in there without trying yeah yeah all right now here's your spoon the last ingredient that we're gonna add is a half a stick of butter i'm surprised yeah try next shot all right how much half a stick of butter okay all right now we're gonna cook this over about medium this is gonna take a little longer because suckers have to cook to the hard crack so we're gonna have to cook this to 300 degrees ooh that's going to be hot we don't want to get that it's going to be hot no when it gets to 300 degrees we're gonna put in a small box of cherry gelatin now you can make any flavor you want there's a lot of different choices out there staying but i don't i don't know anybody that doesn't love a cherry sucker that's my favorite uh-huh but you can make grape or orange or lime there's a lot of different flavors out there you could make yeah what you showing it's starting to cook up pretty good for you past 200 and climb in five you'll want to be very very careful with children around this kind of hot syrup let them enjoy just eating but don't let them near the stove all right so where are we now staying i just saw something oh my goodness we're getting up there aren't we i'm already passed uh hardball and with uh soft crack now you got that right [Laughter] we're there stan we're there yes yes so let's cut her out and we're gonna quickly stir in our cherry flavored gelatin and i'm going to take out oh that's our thermometer yeah it's looking
