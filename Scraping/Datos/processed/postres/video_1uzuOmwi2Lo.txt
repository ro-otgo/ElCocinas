- Hey y'all, I'm in the kitchen. I have the pleasure of. being here in the kitchen with my cousin, Don Hires. With the exception of COVID, it's like Christmas and. Thanksgiving didn't happen. - That's right. - Because we were kinda home-bound, but y'all have spent. every Christmas with us, you and Darlene, for how many years? - 12, 15, something like that. - Yeah something like that. - I mean a lot. It's crazy. - Every Christmas. Well guess what? They're not spending Christmas with us this year cause they're going to New Jersey and dogsit. - And having a ball! (both laughing) Yeah. - Picking up dog turds. (both laughing) And cleaning up pee pee spots. - Oh yeah.. - So y'all will have a ball. So, every Christmas as. soon as Don and Darlene walk in the door I said. "Okay, ready to make your Cherry Christmas Cookies?" He makes them every year. Well last year we shot a YouTube. - Uh huh. - Of the twelve days of Christmas cookies. - Yeah, yeah. - And we made a cherry cookie but is wasn't the same thing Don. So, this Christmas we. are making the real deal, Christmas cookie that you make every year. So go. - Batches and batches and batches. - Go. - Okay well this ain't, (both laughing) - It's really pretty simple, the hardest part is just the setup. - Yeah. - Because, well you can see here. - And Heidi did that for you. - Well, I tell you what- (lady laughing) this is going to be the best. year for making these cookies. - I know! - What we have here, we have, I think it's about a half a cup. - Cup, a cup of sugar. - A cup of sugar, a half a cup of Crisco. - Yes and we're using the butter flavored. - Butter flavored. - Solid shortening. - Yes, that's right. And then a half a cup of. Maraschino cherry juice. - Yeah. - And the trick here is, I don't know that you can buy Maraschino cherry juice. - You can, I've bought it before. - Oh, you have? - But why, because you need- - We're gonna need the cherries? - Yeah you need the cherries. - So just buy a combat sized. jar of Maraschino cherries - Okay - And separate the cherries. and you have the juice. (beater whirring) - That's what I recommend too, so, okay, I've got your solid shortening. with your cup of sugar. - That's right. - And, do you want to add - I like- - Do I need to cream this a little better? - I think it needs to be. creamed a little better. - Okay. - And then just, you do. this like you do a lot of baking you add a little and. add a little until you're - Well the only thing. is baking is so precise. - It's chemistry. - It darn sure is, it's all about science. Okay Don - All right here we go. - Just slowly okay? So I won't splash it all over us. - Well we gotta add an egg, one egg - Okay. - And then we add a,. about a half a teaspoon of salt Paula. - Okay. - And a couple of. teaspoons of baking powder. - Okay. It is powder now not soda? - It's not soda no, no no no. - Okay, why don't we add. this powder to the flour. (phone rings) - I think so, you're gonna - And I'll give you - A whisk.. - A whisk. - And then we mix it all together. - Yeah. - There you go. - So I'm going to go ahead and beat this egg in it while you're - Please! - Okay so, we've got the. prep done over on this side, now we need to add the cherries, the nuts and the flour, but I. think we'll start with - I would recommend the flour first. - Flour first, yes. - And then fold this in. with a spatula or something. - Yes that's right. - [Davey] And the almond. - And the almond. - I'm going to go ahead and add the almond - About a half a teaspoon. - Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. - All right, well, there you go. One little cuppy, cap. - [Davey] I think it. called for a full teaspoon. - Interesting - [Mikey] You might want to. keep some of that recipe. - [Davey] Is it half teaspoon? - Yeah. Yeah. - Don you might want to. keep some of that recipe a secret because once. Paula finds out you may not but you know. (both laughing) - Well there is that. - [Mikey] You may not. get another invitation. - Yeah, well. - Oh don't tell him that Mikey. - Oh stop making my. day, stop making my day. - Cause listen, I love it. when he comes in and takes some of the pressure off. our hands. I love it. - And we have a good. time cooking together. - Yes we do have a good time. - Not just making deserts, and cookies, but the prep we do on. Christmas morning together - Yeah. - When everybody else is in bed. - Yeah. (beater whirring) - It's like a, the most. powerful little hand mixer. - It is, well it's a good brand too so. - Do you want me to dump. the rest of your flour in? - Yeah, yeah, let me use this a little bit. There we go. - Yeah, so, lefty. - That's me, that's me. Are there any other lefties in our family? - My Daddy was a lefty. - Well there you go. - And, Don and I are first cousins, his father, and my father were brothers - That's right, that's right. - My father lived a very. lived a very short life. Uncle Bernie enjoyed a fairly long life. - He did. - How old was uncle Bernie when he passed? - He was 76. - You know, for the life he lived - He beat the odds, because health and him was not exactly close friends. - No, I mean he smoked. them cigarettes like there was no tomorrow. - Well there weren't going. to make them anymore. - And liquor drinks. - Yeah he enjoyed it. - And liquor drinks to. go with those cigarettes he lived life large. - He did. He did. And he enjoyed it. - He did. He did. - Whereas, and it's funny about Uncle Earl being left handed,. everybody said when I was young, that I resembled. him more than anyone else in the family. - Really?. - Yeah And grandma always said that. - Really? - Yeah. - Our little angel Grandmamma. - Yeah she said "Donny, you look just like Earl Wayne." (Paula laughs) And your Daddy, all the. kids loved your Daddy, as you're well aware. - Yes - He gave his time, he. acted like he was really interested in the children. - And my Daddy he loved to laugh. - He loved it and your laugh. is just like his laugh. - Oh, you think so? - Oh, Paula no question. Okay I think we've got this just about - I think we do too so. now we're just going to fold in the cherries and the nuts. You want me to chop these. nuts a little bit finer? - What do you think? - Well lets lift that up.. - Yeah. - If you would just pass me a knife. Not that little one. - No, no let's use this one,. because you can rock it. - Okay. - There you go. And I like the way you. do that, I think it's important that when you. are using sharp instruments that you use them correctly. You rock the knife and sort. of push at the same time. - Yes, you want to be careful. - So you and me going to. put in these cherries? - Yeah, I'm right behind. you with your nuts. - I know you are. Nuts for nuts. Okay. And this is, probably. the most strenuous part is folding these in. - Uh huh. You know what? This poor guy, and I really do feel bad about it now, but I would almost drive him crazy, (both laughing) because I was a big. teaser, but now I just like to play jokes on folks (chuckles) and he was the lucky recipient. (Paula laughing) - Lucky me. - That's why he's screwed up in the head. (Paula laughing) - Thank you for that little shock too. - Uh huh, watch your sore groin. Is your groin growing? - My groin, yeah. - All right, here's. something I forgot to do that's so very important. - Yeah, spray it - I forgot to spray it, so. - There you go. - Here we go. - You like that or you want the powder? - No. - Okay, how about flour? - I was going to say. I don't know what kind of powder you are talking about. So, is this about the size you make? - Yeah I think so, and I. usually do four or five times six or seven, so. I can get, you know, two or three dozens a pan. - All right, I'm going to. turn it over to you now since it's your cookies. Now do these spread much? Can we get four? - We can get four. - Okay, well I'm going to slide them. - Yeah you can get four. - Over a little bit. - Okay - Okay, you may have. to keep spraying that. - Yeah I'm afraid so. - I mean I can get a. spoon and help you, but you know it's very important y'all, when you're making your cookies, that they're all the same size because if they're different sizes - They cook differently and. - Yes, yes. - You have some that are overcooked and, - Some that are raw. - Mhmm. - All right let's see if. we can share this bowl Don. - I think so because its. going to take forever. - If you'll take your cookie. sheet and sit down there. - Yeah. - And then we can share the bowl. - Okay good. - How's that? - Works perfect. - Okay Don. - Well as you can see, these. are prettier than yours. - No they're not! (both laughing) You are wrong sucker! - These are, yours are. pretty, mine are uniform. - Yes. But mine are uniform. - Well, yeah they are. So what do we do now? - We gon' put them in the oven. - All two? Okay we'll do that.. - Yes, all two. - So let's go. And two cookies sheets. used up all the dough so that's perfect. What you saying Mikey? - [Mikey] Nothing. - And we're going to bake these, for eight to nine minutes. - [Davey] At? - 350. All right so Don? - Yes ma'am? - You've got to make your frosting. - Lucky me! Let's do it. - He's a lucky guy! - That's it. - All right I'm going to. kind of clean up this mess - Okay. - And I can't remember if. you used the mixer with your, - Well you almost have to. - Okay, well I'm going to wash these and get these back to you. - Okay, this, this frosting you can use, you know, a store bought. frosting if you want to. I like to use this. because it's not as thick, and when it sets it's a nice finish to it. - Yes - So, what we have is. a teaspoon of Crisco. - A solid shortening. - Yes, yes. Solid shortening. - I don't know why you'd. go through the trouble of making this wonderful. cookie, and then use a canned frosting with it. I just wouldn't do it. - I don't understand that. - If I was going to do. it, I'd do it right. - Do it right. Do it right or don't do it. - Yeah. Okay let me. make sure that these are in the right spot for you,. because it makes a difference. - It does, and making the recipe, the tricky part is ensuring that the confectioners. sugar stays in the bowl, so you have to use a low speed at first, to get underway. - A teaspoons not very much. - No. No. - So here you go. That's a teaspoon. - There we go. - In my guestimation. - Well it's close. - Do you need here let me reach in here. and get you some scissors. - Okay, and it says three. quarters of a pound, but we don't have a- - Three quarters of a pound would be about two and a half cups.. - Okay. that's a pound.. - Okay And this is a two pound bag. - Yeah. - So I would say, - What are you gonna use? Okay. - Yeah. All right, there's two,. so there's like three and a half cups to a pound of sugar so use three quarters of a pound. - I think that's about right. - Is that what the recipe calls for? - Yeah three quarters of a pound. - Okay. So I'm going to use. about two and a half cups. - That'll be perfect. - And we can always add more. - Sure. Sure. And we are going to need a dash of milk. - Okay. Well you can start with the frosting and I'll get your stuff. anything that you need - All right. So set this on low, when you start. (beater whirs) - I'm going to go ahead. and add your almond. - Almond?. - Yes. - I'm going to use this because that top. That top has a little something-something in it to keep it fresh. - Yeah , yeah. - All right. So it calls. for a half teaspoon. - We're going to use a dash of milk and I think everybody. will be surprised at how that helps this liquefy. - I've just pulled out. half and half y'all. And you got to have some. red food coloring right? - Mhmm. - Okeydokey. Oh here it is we already had it out. - Good. - I like this gel. - I haven't used it. - It's a little bit more intense. - Mhmm, I can smell it, it smells good. There we go. - Yeah it's going to. take more than a dash. - Yeah it sure is. But it's starting to come together. - Mhmm. - I think we'll need another little dash. - Oh yeah, yeah. But when you see it. starting to take shape, a little liquid will go a very long way. - Yes, yeah. - With your confectioners sugar y'all, so, you'll want to be a little aware. So you tell me when it's. about the consistency that- - Okay, it's starting to get that- - You may want to turn that, okay you're just on one. that thing is powerful, how does that look? - I think its starting to look good. - I think so too. - You see how it's kinda creamy there? - Yeah. - I mean, do we need to. add more powdered sugar? - I don't know. - I don't remember. - What you do is that you don't cover that. cookie completely because it's going to spread a little. - Unless you're Paula or Michael Drew. - Unless you're Paula or Michael Drew. - Then Mike wanna come. back for a double dip. - Yeah. This is a good start. (inaudible) - We can always add to. it to get it all thicker. - We can, we can - But if you did want it,. I know that you used to that it was thin enough for it to - Yeah that's just about. the right consistency. I think, I think. - Kind of roll down your cookie. - Sure. - And what are we doing with these? - Those go on top of the. cookie after you ice it. - Okay, are we going. to use the whole cherry or cut them in half?. - What we can do, we've got a few minutes. before the cookies are done, I'm thinking cut them in half. - Okay. You can get you a knife,. maybe one of that little nice. - Yeah, I think so. - Cause that cherry ain't very big. - No. And I personally think. this makes the cookie. Myself. - Oh mine are so much prettier than yours. - I doubt that very. seriously, but we will see. We'll see what the comments are too. - Okay I believe I'll have a bite. Who wants a bite? Who wants a bite? - You want a bite. - All right now we have. to let these cool y'all and then we'll ice them. But piggy Paula, couldn't. wait that long so I just frosted one, hot. - Tell me if it's bad or good. - It's everything I remember Don. (Don chuckles) Cause the only time we had. these are at Christmas. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know there are people. they just, they like them. - We like them. Does anybody else want to taste? - I do. - Okay. (Don laughing) Would the film-maker like a little taste? - Just a little taste, thank you. - I can't tempt Davey, he. is on his special diet. He doesn't vary. - Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take one of these, and look at that. - Now I'm going to have. to eat another one, cause I ain't have the. cherry on top of mine. Right? - Oh Paula. See it's dripping, but, it'll harden up. But it's not going to be. around long enough to harden up because it's basically. going between my lips. - There you go. Okay now remembered my. half of cherry, that time. - These are crispy. - Mhmm. - These are crispier than I remember, and they're good. - That's that wonderful. restaurant commercial oven. - It is. - So good Don. - That is good. - It's worth having you. around just to make these (both laughing) It's worth having your. aggravating butt around. - There you go. - I love you Cause. - I love you.
