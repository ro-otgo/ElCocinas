we come down to Florida to visit she would have this cake on the counter waiting for us so we're gonna start with two sticks of butter Rema yes and we're gonna add two cups of sugar and we're gonna cream that well son and our actual cake part is like your standard 1 2 3 4 K it's a cup of milk 2 cups of sugar 3 cups of flour in 4 eggs 1 2 3 4 now I'm gonna take our cake pans and I'm just gonna spray these real good plus I'm gonna dust them with a little flour so that'll make sure they come out good [Music] we're gonna add one egg at the time break them into another bowl and make sure each egg is fine and turn it up his highs little go son to through your cream there egg number two all right so we're gonna measure out one cup of milk and we're gonna alternately add our flour and our

and sell them our house the pecan me get a pound I don't remember something maybe thirty nine I pay on something like that 29 cents of money ultra bugs but it was enough money to get us to the fire I did not like doing it yes but you love going to that fire again and there was no no fair money this cake is a beautiful ain't it beautiful it brings back the fondest memories I'm a stickler about my cakes being the same size so I tried to understatement I tried to measure out the same amount and as the cake batter goes down then my mount goes down [Music] okay now we've knocked them out to just get the air bubbles out y'all in level amount we're gonna put these in the oven 350 degree preheated oven and we're gonna bake them for about 30 or 35 minutes I'll be keeping a close eye on them and
