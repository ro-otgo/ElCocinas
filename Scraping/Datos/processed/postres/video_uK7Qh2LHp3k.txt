[Music] come on in and see this one because this recipe is so intriguing and interesting the two foods that are fixing to collide is sugar and mashed potatoes it doesn't sound logical does it but you're gonna be blown away by the flavor and the taste of these little chocolate eggs and I'm fixing to make for us now I'm gonna take two one-pound boxes of confectioner sugar I have taken mashed potatoes from yesterday and I have added a stick of butter so I'm gonna take these mashed potatoes and I'm gonna work them into our confectioner sugar and I'm just gonna work that in and I'm gonna add about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla flavoring if you wanted a chocolate egg sift about 1/4 of a cup of cocoa powder in with your confectioner sugar you could take candied cherries and chop them up and have a cherry cream filling on the inside of these all right I'm diving in with my hands now y'all and the heat from my hands is gonna break down that buttery mashed potato and you can see how it's already starting to stick together you may find that you need to add a little bit more powdered sugar or a little bit more mashed potato but either way it should come out the consistency of marzipan so see a anyway you go your problems can be remedied so I think I'm gonna make mine very close to the size of a real egg wait so does that kind of look like an egg now you can make almost eggs the size of a jelly bean so now we're just gonna take our eggs and dip them and you can see the ones that have set how much better they dip then the softer ones so I would say to form your Easter eggs into the desired shape and then maybe put them in the refrigerator and let them harden a little bit and then dip them but you can see I have taken just a plain flaked coconut and I've tossed it and a little green food coloring so it looks like the eggs are sitting on grass I love melted chocolate child so instead of getting one of those that set up I'm gonna get this one with the soft chocolate it's delicious you can see the creamy inside [Music]
