- Hey, y'all. Jamie Dean here. I'm in Mama's kitchen. I'm making blueberry dumplings today. Blueberry dumplings. It's a dessert and we're gonna cook it. And it's gonna be off the chain. We're making dumplings. to drop into our boil. My mama makes cornbread drop dumplings and she does it in pot. liquor for Thanksgiving. Same thing, except we're. gonna drop dumplings into smoking hot, cooking,. black blueberries. So the first thing we gotta do. y'all is get our water going. So I got two cups of water. Get my stove turned on. I'm gonna add a cup of sugar and then I've got these. beautiful, fresh blueberries. I'm just gonna go ahead. and put all these in. And I want this to cook,. cook, cook, cook, cook. And we're gonna just let that go. That has to boil. We need that to be boiling. So let's move over here to our dumpings. This is a simple dumpling mix. that we're making using flour. I've got baking powder and some sugar. I'm also gonna add pinch of salt. Let's mix this in and then into this, I'm gonna cut some butter. Now, when you cut butter in, they make there's a beautiful pastry. tool that you can use but you gotta drawer full of 'em already. If you wanna save a few. bucks and just use a fork. And as we cut the butter into this flour, it's gonna get a little bit more crumbly, a little bit more smooth. This is kind of a boring part of baking, but if you like to bake, you've cut butter into. flour more than one time. So y'all gimme a second. Let me do this. We're gonna add a little. bit of milk to this, and make our dumplings. and that'll give us time to boil our blueberries up. Y'all stick around. Blueberry dumplings. Hot dog. Okay. Y'all I got our butter cut in. You see what that looks like? It's kind of a, a crumbly type deal. And now we got to make our dough. So we're gonna add the milk. And I'm gonna mix this up. And if you look into our. pot right next to here you can see we've got. our blueberries rolling. Now, this is much like the. peach cobbler that we make. This is like the, maybe the homemade. dumplings that you had when you were growing up. We're not gonna disturb these. Once they go in here, we're gonna cover 'em, and let them cook undisturbed. I've managed to grab the worst tool out of a professional kitchen in the whole world to mix this up. I'm gonna fight through it. It's hardheadedness prevails in the end. And if I just keep doing it, even though it's harder, it'll work. All right, here we go. Uh oh! Let me grab a teaspoon. Do you see how hard that water's boiling? By the teaspoon, I'm gonna drop these in. God. It smells wonderful. Now, once we get here, y'all do not stir. Cannot stir this. I'm gonna drop these in, and I'm gonna cover it. And it's gonna sit covered for 20 minutes. Hoowee! Y'all let me finish this up. Get myself together. In about 20 minutes, we eatin'''' blueberry dumplings. You ready? Get the ice cream. Y'all were here with. our blueberry dumplings. I've cooked them for 25 minutes. Didn't stir 'em. Didn't uncover it. Been patient. Clean up a little bit. Getting ready. Here we go. Mmm! Mmm! Blueberry dumplings. Who ever in a million. years would've guessed. And so now I've got my little bowl here loaded up with my ice cream. It's like a chicken pot pie, almost. Look at that. Good gracious. Blueberry dumplings. Yeah! Woo! And look. It's a new thing Theresa found. This is real heavy whipping cream All ready in a container. Ready to go. Look how pretty that is! That is blueberry dumplings, y'all. It's easy to make. Let me see. Mmmhmm. Easy to eat, too. Hey, I'm Jamie Dean, and this is Good Food. I'll see y'all around the kitchen.
