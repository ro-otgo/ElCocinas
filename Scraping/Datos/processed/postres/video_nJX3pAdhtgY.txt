hey yo I'm back in the kitchen with my  aka bubbles and we'd like to welcome you all to Paula's kitchen quarantine kitchen cooking whatever what'd he say it was quarantine what we call Teresa oh listen it's so good because Susan and I had not seen each other since Christmas and I have certainly missed my friend and and a lot of friends but I mean you and I are exceptionally tall exceptionally close yes so I've missed that at least it so bad so y'all we are walking down memory lane again with this recipe I'm gonna share with y'all a recipe called Krispy Kreme bread pudding and I want to tell y'all it was such a quickie dink that this happened when I was doing food themes for my cooking show you know they would send things and this is what this is gonna be our thing for the coming up show that you're gonna film well it came up Krispy Kreme Doughnuts I said you know a Krispy Kreme donut you just eat it with a big old glass of milk and there's nothing better well two or three days after I got that notice from the production company a man named Bill Nichols I hope you still had Nick kickin high because you saved my life he sent me a recipe and he said Paula we were having a dinner party and I had failed to come up with a dessert for the dinner party so I want to share with you a recipe that it's kind of made up because he could go to the curb store and find all the ingredients apparently the grocery store was closed so I'm gonna share with y'all the recipe that bill shared with me and I have to tell you it is out-of-this-world delicious but it's one of those that I call a once in a lifetime we have joy my bill has men to come in every year to the life to the Masters and Bill Collins a friend of his this is one of his go-to dollars well it's out of this world but it's not one you're gonna see on Weight Watchers and this would send what are some of those doctors waiting ship no but yeah it was the only Amanda cardiac right no all right so we're gonna start with two dozen donuts and bill I know that I have gotten in touch with you and thank you for sharing this with me so when it was time to film the show guess what because the bill I had a recipe for Krispy Kreme donut bread pudding so we didn't even bother putting this in bozo cuz we just don't dunk dunk dunk don't know all right and um look high country y'all this is I found this in a junk shop or some kind of antique jump shop and I love I am it's really an old-timey and I'll make my chicken and dressing in that I just love it so anyway there's gonna be a link for you to see the recipe so I've got a copy right here so we started with yes uh-huh two dozen Krispy Kreme donuts one yes 112 and I think it's 12 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk and don't get that confused it's not evaporated but it's sweetened condensed and I'm telling you what you could just open that Ken and eat it with a spoon mmm Tang Chuck how many calories do you think are in this well it a yellow only let's see how many calories in that one table that one serving and what's the serving about two tablespoons so that's just a piece off a child yeah get a bit of that out see see all that Raymond weights now well not that's what my Grammy saying I left in your granny's hour telling you that and don't put it on your plate that's exactly right it's children starving in this world all right um two cans of fruit cocktail you don't have to drain it no that's the nice thing that's right colander to wash and then we're not gonna have any dishes to watch for the except one thing yeah so I mean you can just see going to the curb store and finding all this fit the curb store thank you yeah yeah all right and it calls for an urn ounce box of raisins yes put nuts oh and listen to this now you can write down all the sweet a pinch of salt that's gonna cut down on that sugar y'all right and we're gonna put some of those maraschino nuts in here oh let's see two teaspoons of cinnamon I gotta give it out over here and I'm gonna use my good simile it's at our good some wonders that it's really really good I mean I know it makes you know rounded up no but there's a friend that Corey got me started on Salem Theresa keep remember easy buddy the herbs and stuff it's just good good cinnamon iredale your news is she brought it to me she founded the boys downtown know thyself NZ spices but it's on the park yeah yeah down the corner right yes Michael get on a help kick every now and again and say he's gonna he's gonna eat grass for a while or pine cones or something yeah you are in good shape if you want to be a circle what's next I am I got the I got the who me or Theresa you know started watching a movie and I mean you were up and down and I don't dare that watch on the dollar something was scratching so hard I mean anything I could enjoy the movie but knowing they were miserable are displeased so I got my baby no shadow none where is it oh you know what no that's how that's the icing I don't save you it's nuts from you no way oh I see so that is it and the confectioner sugar that Teresa is thinking about that's the rum glaze oh I do it so she won't look at this yeah you know I thought when bill gave me this recipe that they want enough liquid in it mm-hmm here I'm going Congress how about if I take yeah cuz that was kind of awkward for you nuts we didn't bring nuts bill we need nuts some pecans yes I'm a firm believer that you followed the recipe the way it was written the first time and then you make it your own because you know what I want to do I want to take some heavy cream and pour over that because to me it means some liquid it really doesn't okay we don't cover this weekend phone DeBakey okay that's what I was saying it's been I have not made this since I did it on the show what year without a been Louis years ago yeah that we did huh well we're not gonna we're not gonna put nuts on it we got enough nuts in this room you just put it in the up I'm just like this we'll be back in one hour y'all - love love Jim those raisins that you got us put in there that nine ounces that box of raisins I love every one awesome they're like candied and sticky and gooey I'm so ready to dig into this this all right so I'm gonna come back here and drop in I think yeah one stick of butter oh come on this it's not anybody okay we're gonna let that melt a second and then we're going to add in one box of 10-x sugar this is this is that once-in-a-lifetime recipe but you only make one time so make sure you get it right uh-huh no leftovers it's just crazy good I don't know key and when that melts we go slowly and powdered sugar and then we're gonna add rum to taste and this is real rum I would probably use rum extract but it's not it's not that strong because I think about how children know um no you don't make this sauce yeah that's what I'm hoping Susan was a schoolteacher for 27 years so I'm I'm thinking her to know what the heck she's talking about I was in the back and a chocolate Hershey's over here with cinnamon I just went out there she was she was heck no she was actually like but I think she just waked up but no [Music] Suz when I took any piggy in for procedure today this morning yes but I think I think that that it felt huh yeah yeah yeah yeah she's got that shot of no came first and then I think there's novocaine actually and then yeah in the medication okay don't so we're gonna slowly just whip that in and I have no idea not being a drinker I have no idea what to taste that would be what do you think daddy yeah it's Arisa said it was not major dam no I don't think so if there's not enough wrong eh I can fix you some it's just to get the flavor yeah yeah I can pour you uh what what is nice is that over ice no ice neat is okay I'm gonna add a little bit more just because I just want that consistency yeah and I want yeah yeah and I just want to give that alcohol a chance to you know kind of cook out oh gosh yeah I do like amaretto gonna getcha um all right stick your finger in that and see if you think it needs some more rum you don't think so Eddie it might get a little bit no you taste it no you say no you say no I do taste it but it tastes good okay here we go here we go kiddies you know this is kind of like reminds me of a cinnamon roll and you know when you put that that glaze on top of that cinnamon roll you know how it just like makes it evaluation I can't count that high Ike you know I can't bet huh I mean really it's got it has to be about the same as I you know okay I sent him in a roll yeah I would say yeah at least a pass yeah it's not something you give to your hyperactive child net you know it's like I said I wouldn't recommend making this every week maybe once once a year maybe you can get away with that so that treat yes it's definitely a treat you know all right C is ready I'm not even put mine in a bowl I bet you oh wait let me tell you how to do it Jim I
