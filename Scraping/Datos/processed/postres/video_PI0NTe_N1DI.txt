[Music] miss Rosalyn what I want you to do is take your brown sugar and just dump it in your bowl and I'm gonna pour the melted butter over it about a half a stick of melting butter and now if you'll break your eggs into another Bowl you want to break your eggs and put them in a bowl first in case there's it turns out that it's not such a good egg so rather than messing up our dish we're gonna crack one egg at the time and then just toss them over in there all right now all you need to do is mix that together and then I got you a ten ounce bag of like toffee bits and a cup of pecans and add a teaspoon of vanilla to it our filling is gonna be ready to go so y'all can see how easy this is it's like it's really like a pecan pie filling and mr. Jimmy what I need for you to do is unroll this for the crust no sir no sir there she's some flour look I even got a smiley face on it while waiting on you so all we're doing here is using just a refrigerator pie crust because it's it's good and it's so easy and so simple so all you have to do is take your biscuit cutter all right dip it in your flour and then just take your cutter and go around and I'll put your pie crust in for you just stick your finger in there there you go and push it out and I'll bring them over here perfect all right so now we've all got our jobs good production yes it is but we've got some time on our things while we're doing our little Tassie's right so why don't we go so that's a good idea I don't I don't know I was counting on you to tell well I could tell you we had been in the Navy for Matt after we got married for seven years and I had the best job in the Navy I was working for Admiral rickover developing the second atomic submarine and I came home and my father was dying and I saw life in Plains Georgia and I saw what my father meant to the community and I just decided I don't know why to get out of the Navy and I had always meant for it to be my life career I went back to Schenectady in New York and told Rosen that we were getting out of the Navy and she didn't like it I mean that's putting it mildly so we finally got cleared from a navy and we drove home from connected it to planes about almost 9:00 her mouth she never spoke to me all the way to plane [Laughter] say Jack tell your daddy I need to go to the bathroom equipment I remember it well why did you not want him to leave the Navy because I was enjoying it he had really good duty he was had one three-month cruise but in that seven years two years in Hawaii I mean it was fabulous wine it kind of slow but perfect Harv that's kind of my life that's right do you still use the old timey well I would shop I made one it that the cracks but you you put it like my hat don't do it like mad because I'm a furniture maker so I wasn't hard to make now what kind of nuts are these or these we used to call them paper shells from those paper shells paper shelters Florida okay it's hard to sell them as fast as some people eat oh really would you be talking about well do you think the quilt about ready yes sir I think they're probably about ready okay the grits are read it in the Tassie's we're gonna copy cook them for about 12 minutes and Miss Rosalyn if you want to go get comfortable mr.
