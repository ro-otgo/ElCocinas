- Okay, y'all. You are seeing this. recipe on "Fat Tuesday." Is when we're airing this for you to see. Well, you probably know what. "Fat Tuesday" is, right? It's the last day that. Catholics can eat something really, really, really fattening because tomorrow is gonna be Lent and they're gonna be giving up things. Now I am married to a Catholic, but I'm a Baptist. So, I may (laughs), but no. matter what religion I am, I should be more well-versed. than what I am, y'all. But that's all right. I'm not well-versed in a lot of things. But so, anyway, I am. gonna share with y'all this recipe for a king cake. So to start off, I've. got an 8-ounce package of cream cheese, and I've got. one cup of dark brown sugar. So, I'm just gonna blend that together. Really good. So, did y'all know that this cake, the king cake, started. back in the medieval days - [Theresa] Middle ages. - In the middle ages.. - Yeah. - Ah, wow, that was a long,. long, long, long time ago. - [Theresa] Do you know why they had to have this kind of cake? - [Paula] No, why? - [Theresa] 'Cause one person. needed to be king for the day. - Oh, (laughs). - [Theresa] So they put a pea in it. - And who decided this? - [Theresa] I'm not sure about that. But they put a pea in it. - [Paula] Yes, back then, and I'll show you what they put in it. Okay, I think that's good enough. - [Theresa] Yeah, I'm already sold. - I know, I'm so hungry. Want it to get all off. I'm still working, woop. (Paula laughing) - [Theresa] I went. somewhere the other day, and it's kind of funny. - I'm still working with them. - [Theresa] It was a bakery and she had her bowl. left from the cookies. And there were still like. a little bit of dough, and I so wanted to say, "If. you were with Paula Deen, you would not be having that dough." - She left dough in the bowl. Why?. - Well, not a little dough. But you know what I mean, like how you go all the way. around the edges and get every. - [Theresa] She did not do that. - Alight so, back in medieval days, they made this king cake. But they would put like. a dried pea in there. And Theresa tells me that they did that so that whoever got that. pea would be king for a day. I don't know how, I don't know,. did this include children, or just adults? I don't know. Do you know Theresa? - [Theresa] No, but it sounds like fun. - It does sound like fun. I wanna be king for a day. In fact, I used to love. that show "Queen for a Day." In fact, I tried for years,. y'all, to get somebody to produce a show, the. "Queen for a Day" show. Oh, I wanted to do it so badly. I said, I would used to. come home from school every afternoon and. watch "Queen for a Day," and I'd squall like a baby. when those women baked. And this is what it was. like back then, y'all, in the '50s. Their gift would be a washing machine or an iron and an ironing board. Something that they. could do more work with. They certainly were not. giving gifts for a queen. I said, "Work harder, work longer, women." - [Theresa] But to be honest, back then, those were like, those made life simpler. - Yes, and it was who. had the saddest story. And then I think the audience voted on who was gonna be queen. And they didn't give away. cars and things like that. It was, like I said, a. washing machine, or a dryer, or something like that. But so anyway, I never could get anybody to go along with me. But that's all right. I've enjoyed it in my head. So this is so good. Now to this filling, I'm gonna. add a half a cup of pecans, and a half a cup of raisins. Now if you want your raisins plump, I could have set them in. real, real, real hot water and let 'em plump up. But, I'm eliminating that step. because I kind of like 'em a little on the hard side, you. know, for things like this. So there we go, that's all mixed up and it's delicious, y'all. Okay, so now the cake part. We're making this simple y'all. We, I say "we." Theresa went to the grocery store, y'all, and picked up some frozen bread dough. And you just let that thaw. And I'm gonna sprinkle. This is my favorite cutting. board 'cause it's got my pie circles, I love this. This came out years. - [Theresa] I've given this as gifts. - Yes, years ago.. - To people and they love them. - Love it, love it, love it, okay. So. - [Theresa] The bread dough. came in a big pack of like five. - Oh, it did?. - So that's why, I have it, that's why I. have it in a Ziploc bag. 'Cause I didn't need all five. - No. All right, okay. So we got our dough out pretty. close to a 10x18, y'all. And now that wonderful. filling that we made a little while ago, we're gonna put it in here,. and we're gonna spread it within a inch of its sides. Later on, down the way,. in a more Western world, the pea got changed to a baby. And that baby was in there, he represented. our love for our baby Jesus that we had. So, that was why we changed it to a baby at some point in history. - [Theresa] Well, you. know, Paula, I'm Catholic. So.. - Yes, you are Catholic. And you're very staunch. Catholic, aren't you? - [Theresa] I try to be, sometimes. But the thing that we were. taught with the king cake was it was a baby Jesus.. - Yes. - [Theresa] But that it. was done around the time of what we call the Epiphany, which is the 12th day after Christmas, which is January 6th, when the Wise Men found the baby Jesus. - Jesus, yes, because. he was two weeks old, wasn't he, by the time the Wise Men followed the star.. - Right. - To his stable where he was living. - And so that's why they, and then, so they changed it to a baby. To represent Jesus. - All kind of information isn't it? Today. I'm gonna cut that dough off a little bit. I'm gonna cut this one off. All right, and we're. gonna roll this long ways. Just like this. This is gonna be so good, y'all. All right, now what we wanna do now, is now that we can, do you. wanna come around here? - Certainly.. - And take a picture of it this way?. - Eddie does a much better job at cameras, and I realize that, so. - No, you are doing fine. So we just wetting that. edge with a little water. So it will stay sealed. And now we're gonna do. the same thing over here. And we're gonna pinch that together. - Look at that.. - Yes, we don't want that piece 'cause it doesn't. have any filling in it. - We won't tell anybody.. - No. - Just gonna seal it with a little water. Now I'm gonna push some filling in there. - [Theresa] And, Paula, a. lot of what bakers do now. - Now how am I gonna get this. on the cookie sheet (laughs)? I should have put it on. my baking sheet first. Okay, y'all, before I. rolled it into a circle, I should have put it on my. cookie sheet, but I didn't. But I was actually able to just pick it up and transfer it my cookie sheet,. which I've sprayed lightly. And now we're gonna spray our king cake with this spray. And hopefully that'll turn. it a real pretty shiny. - [Theresa] Could you. do an egg-wash on that? - Huh?. - Could you do an egg-wash? - Yeah, you could do an egg wash on this. So this is gonna have to sit for about 45 minutes to an hour in the oven. And what I did, 'cause it's really chilly. It's a little chilly here in. Savannah, so I cut my oven on. And then I cut it off. and hopefully that will, that will be just about. the right temperature. So we're gonna cover. this with plastic wrap. And rise, baby. Like Jesus did on a Easter Sunday, rise. Okay. I have no idea what the, it's nice and warm in. there, nice and warm. I can't remember the. temperature of what they say for a warm spot when you're rising, trying to rise dough. It's something I'll have to. look up, y'all, I'm sorry. I don't have that information. on the top of my head. - [Theresa] We can put. that in the, we can add. - I don't know if it's 85. Yeah, I can't, I just can't remember. But anyway, that's got to do its magic. - [Theresa] And we'll be back. - For the next 45 minutes. Yes, and then the fun part comes in. 'Cause we gonna color. and do all kind of stuff. And you'll notice that I did. not put a baby in the center because I really don't like. the idea of baking plastic. So when we take it out of the oven, I'll cut a little slit and. stick that baby somewhere in that cake, and whoever gets. that piece is gonna be a king or a queen for a day, right? - [Theresa] Eddie and I. will be fighting over it. - You can be a queen too. Not just the king, right? - [Theresa] Yeah. - Our king cake looks great, y'all. And remember, I had it in an. oven that had been warmed, and then I cut it off. So it rose really, really. nice, didn't it, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes, it smells so good. - Yes, smells like yeast rolls, so good. There's nothing better. So now we're gonna put. this in the oven, y'all. We're gonna bake it for. 35 to 45 minutes at 350, I believe it is. Is that right, Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Okay, so I'm putting it in the top rack, which is like the middle,. the middle of the oven. So I think I'm gonna set. the timer for you, Theresa. - Okay.. - Because I am fixing to leave to go to Jack's final. play-off basketball game. Because tonight the winner is the champ. It's the city champ. So again, he's real excited about that. So I'm gonna run to his basketball. game while that's baking. And then we'll finish it. up right after I get back. Okay, look at our king cake,. y'all, it turned out so good. Uh-oh, I left a baby over. here, I got a baby here, I got a baby there. Now I'm gonna just, I. made me a little slit, and I'm gonna stick that. baby in right there. Let me see if I can, there we go. And hopefully the frosting. will cover that up. But I know that that baby is. where I, where my seam is. Okie-dokie, all right. Now we're gonna make the icing. And let me give you all. the correct measurements, a cup and a half a confectioners' sugar, and three tablespoons of milk, and one teaspoon of butter. or vanilla flavoring. So I'm gonna go ahead and get, uh-oh. I'm gonna go on and get our teaspoon of vanilla flavoring in. All right, so I'm gonna measure out three tablespoons of milk. Okay, now we're gonna. need to whip up our icing. And the recipe says if you. need more milk, just add it. Now we've let our king cake. completely cool, y'all. So if we'd put it on. there while it was hot, it would have slipped, it. would have melted all off. So we don't want that to happen. (electronic beeping) And y'all's papa's home, y'all's papa's home. Okay, so I just wanna. make sure I pull the lumps out of there. So I think that looks pretty, pretty good. My milk spoon. And I'm gonna come over here. And I'm gonna start icing. And let it run down the sides. Okay, so we wanna quickly do this because remember the colors of Mardi Gras. Let's see, it's. Golly bum. One is for reverence, one. color is for, gosh, Eddie, do you remember? - [Eddie] No, I was doing the. giveaway when you and Theresa were going over all that. - Were talking about all that. Gosh, now I can't remember. But you can look it up. - [Eddie] The three colors represent. - [Paula] Yeah, what the. three colors represent. I'm thinking one of them was reverence. I'll get every bit of this. stuff out of here, y'all. All right, so here we go. - [Michael] Green, gold, and. purple, representing faith, power, and justice.. - That's it. That's it, y'all. Faith, power, and justice. So here's a little power. - Think that was faith.. - Okay, what's the purple? - Purple is justice.. - Justice. Okay, we're gonna get. some justice in here. Well, hey, Lulu, you. left her outside, Papa. Alright, now here's some purple, oh, I love that purple color. Don't y'all like the purple? I think the green, we. just need some more green. Okay, and what's the yellow for? - Power.. - Power, okie doke. And if you find the baby, Papa, you get to be the king for the day. - [Michael] I had it last year. and I didn't get anything. - Yeah, yeah.. - You got to be king. - [Eddie] You don't remember being king? - [Michael] No. - [Paula] Well, that's too bad. All right.. - That's perfect for my diet. - I know it is perfect your diet. I love the purple color. All right, now I'm gonna try to scoop some of this icing up. I think I would like to. make a little bit more icing next time (laughs). - Imagine that.. - 'Cause y'all know I'm a condiment girl. Okay, can y'all see where. it needs anything else? I think it's beautiful. What do y'all think? Do you think that's beautiful? - [Michael] Yes. - And there's a baby in there. And if you find it, people. - [Micheal] I'm not gonna eat. any of it, so if I find it, I gotta just get a knife and fork. - All right, well, I'm gonna taste it. - [Micheal] Watch you get the baby first. - I know where I put the baby. - [Micheal] That's not fair. - I tell y'all, using. that frozen bread dough that you get from the grocery. store, that is the ticket. Because it made it so simple. Look at our king cake. It's so good, people. You wanna taste it? - No.. - No? - You won't taste it?. - No. - When he, when he diets, he does not cheat. He does not cheat, not one time. You sure you don't want a bite? - I'm not eating.. - He ain't eating it. - That's all right, then. there's more for me and Eddie. Hey look, that's a great way. to get that icing outta there. Mm-mm-mm. You better eat it before Lent. - [Micheal] Y'all should. be bouncing me around. - 'Cause you know, Michael,. you eat this on "Fat Tuesday," 'cause the next day is Lent. So you can't have any when Lent gets here. - [Micheal] I know. - But on "Fat Tuesday," let's eat up. I love them best dishes, y'all. And when this airs, it's gonna be your last. day to be able to, well, it depends on what you're. giving up for Lent. You may be giving up just milkshakes. Right? Love them best dishes, y'all.
