- Hey buddies, come on in the kitchen and I want to thank y'all. for being my sunshine today. It's actually kind of cloudy out. Well now the sun shining out, ain't it? But y'all are my sunshine. and I thank you so much. Ain't that a pretty yellow. that just makes you smile just looking at it. Well, I've got another recipe from a friend that I've never met. Hopefully one day I'll get to meet her. Her name is Sherry Kilgore and she said, "Dear Paula, there aren't. many positive things that were a result of the. pandemic, but you sure were." Thank you so much, Sherry. She said, "I look forward to watching. your show every day. I love watching you cook with your pets and you run around barefoot and talking to Eddie and Teresa." Yeah. What you see is what you get Sherry. So anyway, Sherry has this recipe and she received it. from her aunt Charlene. And she said, "It's one of the easiest. recipes I've ever made." And this sounds so simple, y'all. But at the same time, it sounds decadent. And it's called Chocolate Treasures. And this is the Story Moaning Glory. We got a half a stick of butter. So I'm just going to. cut that right in half and put it in our pot. And then we're going to add. one canyon of Eagle Brand milk. Now, you know Eagle Brand milk and butter. This thing has got to be good. Cause this stuff you could eat. straight out of the canyon. It's so delicious, ain't it? (giggles) I'm making sure we get every. drop out, y'all. Every drop. The triplets y'all, are on vacation. They are with the other. set of grandparents. They're celebrating their. grandmother, Maria Otika. Her 60th birthday. And the children are getting. to meet their cousins for the first time. And the cousins on Claudia's. brother's side, Juan. He has such a beautiful family. They have two sets of twins. and the oldest set eight and then they got a set. of five-year-old twins and then Claud and Bobby. with their triplets. And I know their grand. mama and grand daddy is in hog heaven. It's the first time that. both of their children and all their grandchildren. have been together. So it's a good thing near down there because I think I would be so tempted to split these kids one. of your cookie, Sherry. They sounds so good. All right. So we've got. a half a stick of butter, a can of sweetened condensed meal and now they used to make 12 ounce bags, but now they're 11.5 and. that's milk chocolate. And we're going to put it. over here on this stove. Let's see what Sherry's says. "In a 3-quart sauce pan, melt the butter, Eagle Brand and chocolate chips." And she tells us, "Do not. boil." You know, just melt it. So that's what we're gonna do. And she said, "When melted, remove from. heat and add the vanilla and then the flour, and finally the Pecans and just stir well till blended. And then you drop it on parchment paper and bake it for about 10. minutes on 350 degrees." I cannot wait to taste. this chocolate cookie. Sounds like it is truly a treasure. So we've got the stove on. back there and we getting. Oh, look how nice at room. temperature this butter is. So got it going back there. So we're going to need. to go back here and stir. And make sure it does not boil. So I'm going to take. all my stuff back here. You know that some good stuff.. Yes sorry, baby. (giggles) So here's the ingredients. It's a half a stick of butter,. one can of Eagle Brand, 12 ounce package of milk chocolate chips, one cup of flour, one teaspoon of vanilla and two cups of coarsely chopped pecans. Okey-dockey, it's totally. melted and not boiling. Now we're going to add. like a teaspoon of vanilla. We're going to stir in the flour. And that was one cup of All Purpose. I can't imagine a cookie. being this easy to make. Just sounds kind of crazy, doesn't it. I don't know how to act not having to pull out a big old mixer. Okay. This looks like a chocolate. icing, doesn't it, Eddie? - [Eddie] Mh hmm. Yeah.. I was thinking brownies. - Oh. (laughs) All right. Now we've got to add two. cups of chopped nuts. Now Sherry, you did not tell me how big of spoonfuls to make these. You just said, "Drop on parchment paper." So, I want to get those nuts. stirred in there really good. Wow. (giggles) Ooh. I just love the way those look. All right. I'm gonna, just in case. She doesn't say whether. to spray it or not. But I'm gonna spray it. just cause I got the spray. So, I'm gonna drop it like that big. I'm taking off this paper just kills me. Come on, now. Stick. Okay so, doesn't that look about the size that was talked about, Eddie? All right. In the oven. 10 minutes. And we'll see what Sherry's. been cooking all these years. Love the fact that all. the nuts is in it, y'all. I have to just say this, y'all. You must, must try this recipe.. You must make it. Cause-- - [Woman] You need to break down and tell him that he couldn't. even wait for the film to go before you had. already eaten a cookie. - Yes, yes. One cookie missing, now there's two cookies missing. This is incredible. Gottlieb's bakery, an old, old family here in Savannah. Gottlieb's bakery. And they. made these wonderful choc-- What did they call them?. Teresa, chocolate-- - [Eddie] Chocolate Chewies. - [Teresa] They were. called Chocolate Chewies. - Chocolate Chewies. A. wonderful, wonderful cookie. Well, they have since closed, but they wouldn't be as. good so many years here. This is a chocolate chewy. How? How? How, how, how. can I ever thank you for sharing this recipe with us? I have made these before. That was supposed to be. like the Chocolate Chewy, but it was more detailed than this. I've never made a cookie. that tastes that delicious that was that easy to make. - [Teresa] 15 Minutes. That's. from making it in the-- - Yes. And it makes. And I. said, I didn't know how much to dip it, but I did like a tablespoon. And you know, just kind of. did it like that. (laughs) Just like that, y'all. (laughs) Hold on one second. Yeah. I was just going over the-- No, that's another recipe. somebody gave me. Oh. This is from Sherry. - [Teresa] The other recipe. Your recipe, is that it over there? - No, that's another recipe. Oh. No. That's a casserole. - [Teresa] But they are. gonna need to try it too when they see that one. - This is from Sherry. Kilgore, this recipe.
