well y'all i'm saving the best for last i'm fixing to make michael a dessert and it's a strawberry pie i hear all the birds back there look a shrimp boat's coming in isn't it beautiful i never get tired of seeing them coming by the house all right this is an easy pie we're gonna throw it together like one two three somebody said a while ago paula do you know you've done a whole show without a stick of butter wrong we got a stick of butter in this bowl i'm fixing to whip it up and this is at room temperature it's gotten real soft now i'm going to add some powdered sugar do you hear the seagulls uh yelping out there that's because they're falling behind that shrimp boat to get food to get any shrimp that they might drop so i've got my butter whipped and now i'm gonna add some powdered sugar all right i've got two eggs and i'm gonna beat these up and i'm going to add them to the butter and the cream cheese all right you and i have talked a lot of times about raw eggs some of you are concerned about it some of us are not i happen to be one of those that's not concerned about it because i always make sure i use fresh eggs never an expired egg nor an egg that's got a crack in it i always throw those away but if you're concerned about the eggs you can use a pasteurized egg or you can use the egg beaters now i'm going to beat these up and i'm going to add them to our butter and our powdered sugar all right i've got those beat up now i'm gonna put those in as the store-bought pie crust this will be fine michael won't care a bit all right so i'm gonna put this to the side and let it sit for a minute and i'm gonna get my fresh whipped cream and i'm gonna add a layer i'm just gonna spread that kind of over and around our butter and sugar mixture all right now i'm going to come over here and i'm going to slice some fresh strawberries now i too much wouldn't recommend using a frozen strawberry because they contain so much water and you could use any kind of fruit that you wanted to this would be wonderful with blueberries or raspberries if you're a raspberry lover and the whipped cream to me it's just a travesty if that cream is not sweetened so i always put a fourth of a cup of sugar to one cup of whipping cream no matter what i'm doing with it all right so i'm going to toss this in a little sugar just want to make sure that our berries are sweet in our pie so i'm just going to put a layer of those doesn't that look good against that fresh whipped cream all right now i'm gonna finish putting the rest of the whipped cream on the top of the pie and i'm gonna let some of those strawberries kind of peek out around that inside okay all right so i think i'm going to add just a few whole berries i've got one kind of sliced right there that looks pretty now all i'm going to do is stick this in the refrigerator and let it set up and then it's on the way to the tugboat so i think that pie is just perfect michael's going to love it as well as the men that work with him hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this blast from the past be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as the notification bell to be alerted when i post a video love and best dishes y'all
