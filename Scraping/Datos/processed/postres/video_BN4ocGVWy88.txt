- Okay, Bobby, this is. another retro recipe. Southern tea cakes. - Very retro. They're so good. - All right, so we're gonna. stir together our flour, and that's just extra. flour, and that's our sugar, and our baking powder and baking soda, I believe, check that recipe, son. - Baking flour- - [Paula] Soda and powder. - Four, baking soda, baking powder, yep. - [Paula] And how much salt? - I don't see salt. - I don't have any salt. in that recipe, but- - Just a pinch, it'll always do ya. - I like sweet and. salty, so I'm going to do maybe a 1/2 a teaspoon because. we are cutting this recipe in 1/2 'cause it makes so many. So if you'd start your sifting. - When did you, I don't know, I don't know how I remember. you doing tea cakes. Where did this recipe come from? - Oh my gosh, son, it's. so old, I can't tell ya. - Did you make 'em for us. when I was a little kid? - Oh my gosh, you don't remember. It was just a big, white cookie. - I do remember. - [Paula] Just a big, white cookie. - I do remember, but maybe. that memory is blotted out by the, the chocolate. gobstoppers that you used to wrap in Saran wrap and put in the refrigerator. - Put in the refrigerator. - Everything else is sort of shoved aside. I think about how those. things were so good. - Okay, you wanna start doing that? - So I'm sifting, I'm sifting,. I'm sifting, I'm sifting. - Yeah, sift, sift, sift. - Okay, got it. - Rather than pulling out a sifter, I just use this little strainer sometimes, you know, if I don't have a. tremendous amount of flour. - [Bobby] Well, what's the difference? Just the sifter would have a handle on it and sort of spin it around? Well, this works just fine. This is what you'd use. for like powdered sugar on top of a cake or something like that. - Exactly. - Or to wash your vegetables in. I'd wash my vegetables in, oh, look at that, there goes Aunt Peggy. - Look here at great, great. - Aunt Peggy, we're making tea cakes. - What you doing? - [Peggy] I came to see what I can sample. (laughing) - [Paula] Well, I just took. tomato grits out of the oven. - I'll try those. - [Paula] C'mon. - Just a small serving. - All right, listen, how. a serving like that size? - [Peggy] That'll do it. (laughing) She eats like a bird, y'all. Come on in. - Okay, well we have sifted, this is done. The only left is, you know what's left? - What? - Salt. (laughing) - Push it through because it's kosher. It sure is. - Why push it through when I. can just dump it into my hand and drop it in here? - [Paula] Bobby, you are a little smart. - Well, that's why I went to Harvard. (laughing) All those years ago, Aunt Peggy. I bet you didn't know. that, did ya, Aunt Peggy. - [Peggy] I knew you when I was there. - You went to Hardin. (laughing) - I went to Hardin. - [Peggy] I'm waiting. (laughing) - [Paula] You don't even standing up. - She's over there waiting on you to bring her a bowl of grits. - [Peggy] Yeah, I never run across the- - Well, in the meantime I. will be here making tea cakes, which I've never read before,. so, so far I've sifted flour and I've sifted baking. powder and baking soda. And I've sifted some, how you doing? (laughing) Hey, I sifted some kosher salt. You're looking good. - [Paula] Doesn't she look good? - She looks great. Come on in and get some grits. And now we have to add two eggs, a 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and. 1/2 stick of softened butter and a little bit of vanilla,. a teaspoon of vanilla. - [Paula] Yeah. - Yeah. Did you catch all that? - No, but I know you did. - I got all the dry and we've sifted it, so now we're going to add. the rest of the ingredients. - We've got to add one egg. - Gotta add one egg. - And let's beat this. egg up with that 1/2 cup of buttermilk, how about that? - All right. - And then y'all, we're. gonna have to put this in the refrigerator and let. it sit for about an hour. - We could make something. else while we do that, right? I love cooking with you. I get all kinds of. things that I never get. Taste sugar and salt. - Yes. - Butter. (laughing) Almost forgot what it tasted like. - All right, let's see. Now when do we put in that butter? - Everything now. - And remaining ingredients, yes. There we go, so we need a little vanilla. - This is nice. - That butter soft? - It's nice and soft, so we'll. just, before you add that, let's see if you can. incorporate that butter. - Does everything have a stick of butter? - Yes, son. The original is two sticks, but we're only halfing the recipe. (laughing) Don't give your mama no lip. - No. - Yeah, you wanna use pastry cutter. - That's it. - Yeah. - Yeah, just do it that. way, and you know what? I'll go ahead and add the vanilla to your egg and buttermilk too. - Okay. - [Paula] You know what? I think I wanna put a little. almond flavor in it too. What do you think? - [Bobby] I think it sounds good. What's the- - [Paula] Bobby, you have. stepped in something sticky, son. I hear you just talking. - It's just clean, shoes are just clean. - [Paula] Well, last night I found honey. - So what is the, the flavor of a tea cake is really kind of mild, isn't it? I mean, there's not. really a whole lot to it. - Nope, it's very good. and I just think, Bobby, one of those recipes that. started so, so, so long ago, when you didn't have a lot of ingredients. Women came up with, and men, I guess, I'm sure some of the men were cooks. But, you know, people. just came up with what they had to work with. and they always had flour and they always had eggs 'cause. most people had chickens. - Well, that butter mixed right in. - 'Cause it was nice and soft. Now this is gonna be wet and sticky, you're gonna wanna change utensils. - Try with the spoon or. with a whisk, do you think? - I'd go to a spoon. Spoon it. There you go. It's so nice to have. a man around the house 'cause sometimes mixing up stuff is hard. - [Bobby] So we're going to. combine all this together and then we're gonna. form it into like a disc, like kind of just a big, flat ball. And then we refrigerate. for an hour, is that right? - [Paula] Yeah, so we can roll it out. - [Bobby] What's the reason. for refrigerating it? So it becomes-. - [Paula] So it can get hard. So we can roll it. - Aunt Peggy, how's the grits? - [Peggy] Good. - [Paula] Yay, where ya going? - [Peggy] Putting my. (indistinct) out of my way. - Oh, okay, now I need to push you up. I'm just afraid to. - [Peggy] Yeah, I know. - [Paula] You need to sit. back before I push you up so I don't remove your breast. - [Peggy] I like if you. just let me hang out here. (Peggy talking quietly in background) - [Paula] Okay, so you're. saying don't push ya. - [Bobby] Okay, Mom, I think. it's pretty well combined. - [Paula] Okay, ooh, yeah, that's good. So what I'm gonna do now is- - [Bobby] Did we add the vanilla? - [Paula] Yes, I added. it to the buttermilk. - [Bobby] I have stood. here in eaten plums. Mom's got all the plums. on the counter right there and I must've eaten seven. - [Cameraman] Yeah, it was full. - [Bobby] It was full, yeah. - [Paula] The best. plums I think I've ever- - I've got a little bit of a- - Oh no, a stomachache. - Yeah. - Well, if you have to run to. the bathroom, I understand. - No, no, I'm just kina like,. like I ate too many plums. - Well, they are so good. - They're fantastic. - So I'm going to get all that- - I love fresh fruit juice. I'll stand around and just eat. fruit all day at our house. We all do. - I know it. And little Ollie likes it as good as you. - [Bobby] Oh my gosh, my. kid (speaking faintly). - [Paula] She just takes it. She picks it up and crams it in her mouth. (laughing) - [Bobby] You should see that child eat. - [Paula] All three of your. children are good eaters. - [Bobby] Yeah, I don't know. where they get that from. - [Paula] I don't know. - Can you get a good. closeup on Pearl's face? Maybe we'll see where it all comes from? Just throw in the food towards the face. (laughing) - That's all right. - [Theresa] Paula, he's being mean, you have flour all over your face. - You've got flour all over your face. - I do? - [Theresa] That's why- - I've gotta clean damn. paper towel right here. - Well aren't you used to do it. - Well, aren't you used to doing that, cleaning somebody's. face all day, aren't ya? - Well, I'm more concerned. with the dagum floor and the walls and the TV. They can get it off their own faces. They just throw it all in my kitchen. - All right, look at that. beautiful dough, y'all. - Oh, it's perfect. - [Paula] That is some pretty dough. - [Bobby] That came together- - [Paula] So easily. - [Bobby] Just lickity split. You know what? Hold on just a sec. - [Paula] What? - [Bobby] You've got a couple of, you got one hanging on the wall over here. - [Paula] Oh the banana pudding recipe. - [Bobby] Yes, but I this- - [Paula] But I didn't sew that one. - But this is, this is what we're making right now. - Yes. Grandma's Tea Cakes. - Grandma's Tea Cakes and this- - That called for lard, Bobby. I probably did that in. the early, early '70s. - Mama would have, I remember. this hanging in our house my whole life. - Your whole life. - I say our house, like. we lived in one house, that is not what I mean. We moved all over the place. - 23 times we moved. - Every apartment that we lived in, every house that we rented, every place that we hung our hats, I remember Grandma's Tea Cakes crochet, is that the word you use? - [Paula] No, cross stitch. - Cross stitch, handing. in every, look at that. - [Paula] Every kitchen we had. - I mean, look at that. - Where did you find that? I can't remember where it is. - And this is the. original frame, obviously. - Oh gosh, yeah. I wonder if it has the date on it. - No way that I can see,. it doesn't have one here. There's no tellin'. I wonder if there's $100. hidden in here someplace. I'd be willing to make. a bet that there is no. - There is not. - No, no. - [Paula] I'd be. surprised if you found $1. - Yeah, me too. Looks like somebody's already checked, so if there was one there, it's long gone. - You know, son, I do remember that day you came over to my house. You were living with one of. your buddies at that time. You came home, you said,. "Mom, I'm so hungry." And I said, "I am too, son." - How come I didn't look like it? (laughing) I guess we ate all the starches. And you said, "I'm so hungry." And I said, "I am too, son." I said, "Let me go to our change drawer "and see if I can get. up enough money for us "a number two at McDonald's." And in the bottom of. that little bitty change, in that white jewelry box, I found a $50 bill that I had. Bobby me danced all over that living room. And he got in his car and he. went to McDonald's and got us two or maybe three number twos. - I remember, that would have- - I got a number two. - That would have been, we got a lot of number twos in our life. (laughing) - Yeah, we got a lot of number twos. - That would have been. about 1990, maybe? '89? '88, '89, something like that. Ah, who cares. Alright, so Grandma's Tea Cakes. That's what we're making now, into the fridge for about an hour, so we're gonna go and we'll. be back in about an hour. - Yes. Okay, y'all I'm going to finish. up those Southern tea cakes by myself 'cause Bobby had to leave, but I'm doing this a little. different from the recipe. It says to roll 'em out, y'all, but you know what, to slice. 'em is so much easier. So that's what I'm gonna do. rather than rolling them out and then sticking and. having to, it's just a mess. So this is the way we're. gonna do our tea cakes. And like I said earlier, they just a plain cookie. that all the housewives, the women doing the cooking, or the men. They always had these. particular ingredients, so nothing fancy. And they're just a big round cookie. He's kind of flattened on one side, so I'm having to kind of give. 'em another little shape. - [Cameraman] Tea biscuits. - Tea biscuits, yes, tea biscuits. That looks like biscotti. - [Cameraman] Yeah. - Ooh, I made some of Greg Cantor's biscotti the other day, y'all. It was the best I've ever eaten. So go to Greg's Kitchen, I think is how his Facebook page reads. You will not be sorry. He is a friend of mine and. that boy knows he can cook. So Greg's Kitchen. And it was peanut butter. Peanut butter. - [Cameraman] White chocolate. - And white chocolate biscotti. And Greg sent me some. in the mail and I said, "Ooh, I got to have this. recipe, I got to call him." And he said it's on his website. So we went to his website and sure enough, there it was first recipe that came up. So Greg, I thank you so much. All right, this one looks a little shy, so I'm gonna come down here. and get a little bit more and stick up underneath that one. This is also a good cookie that you could, if you wanted to roll it out,. you could do it for Christmas. Do it in Santa Claus shapes or, that one's a little thin, too. (dog barking) And there we go. There they go. (laughing) So we're gonna put this. in the oven at 350. I can't remember for how long Theresa. It's been so long since I made a tea cake. - [Theresa] Where's my recipe? - But Bobby showed y'all earlier. - [Theresa] 10 to 12 minutes. - Okay, 10 to 12 minutes. You wanna set that timer, Theresa? - [Theresa] I certainly will. - Bobby showed y'all the. cross stitch that I did for the tea cake recipe. I did that back in the '70s, early '70s- - [Theresa] You wanna put 'em in? - When I used to make 'em. Yes, Theresa would like for. me to put 'em in the oven. - [Theresa] They're home cooked. - Did Bobby 'bout drive you crazy talking. - [Theresa] No. - You sitting there and. waiting for him to shut up. - [Theresa] No, not at all. I like his stories. - I do too. I love his stories. Okay, 10 minutes. I think I let these cook. for like 12 minutes. The recipe called for 10, But I think 12 was the magic number. So you see, these are just very, very plain, unpretentious, delicious cookies. And you could certainly dress 'em up. You could brush 'em with some. egg white and put sprinkles on 'em or something like that. Or like I said, you could roll them out like the recipe tells you. to do into different shapes, but to me a tea cake. should look just like this. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Almost looks like a flat. biscuit, doesn't it? - [Theresa] Strawberries and whipped cream will be fabulous with it. - Oh gosh, yes. This would make a powerful. good strawberry shortcake. Just pour some sweetened. strawberries on top and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then some fresh whipped cream on top. It would be so good. So that's it. But those of y'all that. have never had a tea cake, please think about trying this recipe 'cause I've been making. it for a hundred years and Bobby went into the. laundry room and found this, that he showed y'all earlier. Something I did back in the '70s because I made a lot of tea cakes. So that's it. Y'all enjoy, have a. wonderful day, stay safe and I'll see y'all next time. Love and best dishes.
