- Hey friends. I hope y'all are doing. really, really well today. Myself, I've been kind of. thinking about Mother's Day. You know, the time just rolls like you wouldn't believe doesn't it, Teresa?. - It does. - Where does it go? Did it go this fast when we were young? - [Teresa] No. - I don't think so. I don't remember.. - Especially when we were in school. - Oh, in school, the days were so long. (laughs) But anyway, having said that, I kind of am thinking. about Mother's Day now. So I thought, well, I. will share some recipes with the family members of the mother and maybe they can make. your mother's day meal. - [Teresa] Hint hint. - Yeah. So if you like this recipe,. share it with whomever you're going to designate. to be your dessert maker. And I think you'll like this one. We're going back with. our good old standby, our gooey butter cakes. But we are gonna dress this. one up just a little bit. If you like lavender, if you like that little hint of lavender, you will love this recipe. So we're gonna start with. the one box of cake mix. Whoa, get out of there. Any kind of cake mix, it. doesn't matter who it's by. But for this one we are. using a yellow cake mix because we want to keep the. flavor of our cake simple, so our lavender will be able to stand out. All right, so we're gonna put in one egg and we're putting in how. much lavender is this? - [Teresa] Two teaspoons. - Two teaspoons. And Teresa told me, and. it smells so good, y'all. And I asked Theresa, I said, now where did you find that. pulverized lavender? And she said, well, I wound. up having to order it off - Amazon.. - Amazon, yeah. So I wish you could smell it. Smell, Eddie, you like. lavender, don't you? - [Eddie] Yes, you know, - my favorite is. - From back in the day. - [Eddie] Back in the. day shortbread cookies, with the lavender. - [Teresa] I'm was. gonna try to make those. - Well, I think they would be delicious but I remember Eddie saying we have a friend here that. has Back in the Day Bakery. And I remember Eddie making the comment, oh, I love her lavender cookies. - [Teresa] You know, she. makes them also into like a sandwiched cookie with. buttercream in the middle. Oh my Lord.. - Oh, like. - [Teresa] Like a sandwich cookie with. - Well now I can't think. of the word, like a. - [Eddie] Like a Whoopie pie. - A Whoopie pie, thank you, Eddie. It's a good thing he knows me so well, he can finish my sentences for me. (laughs) - [Teresa] It is so good. - All right, you know what? I'm not gonna do that. lavender with the beater. Because I want to just. stir in our lavender. I don't wanna lose a bit of that lavender, you know in my beaters,. because it will get caught and you'll lose some, so. I'm just gonna stir that in. What's wrong? Oh, somebody cut it off. Somebody had cut it off at the main switch. That york is so pretty and orange. Oh, y'all I have missed my chickens. But Eddie and I are making plans we gonna get us a little. old lean tooth Chicken coup and we gonna get our chickens back, which we're so excited over. Okay. And you remember this. is a real stiff batter because this is a crust. to our gooey butter cake. Okay, come on, sling off,. but don't sling on me. Am I slinging on you, Eddie? - Nope.. (laughs) - I don't think it's gonna sling off. So I'll just have to encourage it. You know, I still love just. the plain gooey butter cakes. - [Teresa] This might be my new favorite, 'cause I love lavender, I'm like Eddie. - Well, y'all gonna have plenty of lavender gooey. butter cakes in just a minute. In goes our lavender. And I'm just gonna work it in. And then we gonna press this in to the bottom of the. 13 by nine by two pan. And you know, if you want thicker then you could use a nine by nine I don't know if they. make a 10 by 10 or not, but that's if you just want them thicker.. - Nowadays they make everything. - And I'll tell you what. else works good for 'em, is a spring form pan, y'all. Yeah. And it makes 'em so easy to get out and of course the presentation. is very, very pretty. All right, so this is lightly greased. It doesn't take a bunch, y'all because our crust has a stick. of butter in it already. So we just gonna press this. out where it's completely even. Looks like we got grass. in there, doesn't it? (laughs) Like we got grass shavings. Well maybe trying to scoot it up the sides just a little bit. Just a whee little bit. - I'm gonna go ahead and.. - Preheat that oven. - [Teresa] That's right. So you do put it up. the sides a little bit. - Yeah I said I'm yeah, yeah. I'm gonna put it up just a little bit, so it'll hold that cream. I don't always do that, Teresa, 'cause usually I'm in a hurry. - [Teresa] But I like what you mean in order to hold the filling.. - Yeah. Kind of holds the filling. - [Teresa] Well, back in the day you had to make so many at one time you wouldn't have.. - Oh gosh, I threw that stuff in there. (laughs) Oh I threw it in there. - [Teresa] I lived off of them when we were in the restaurant. What a great thing to live off of. - That and a fried chicken leg. A handle sandwich. Oh great time, (indistinct). that was so good. That's all we had time to eat. We didn't, even though at three. o'clock the restaurant, I had to hold the restaurant and sit down and have lunch together. after we had served. lunch to all our guests. And you could always tell a new person, 'cause honey they couldn't. get enough of that food. I mean they would sit down. and eat and eat and eat. And then you could tell if. they've been there a while. I think I'm gonna grab. me a sandwich somewhere. (laughs) I'll go to McDonald's. Okay, so I've got that patted. out really, really nice. So in our next bowl and you don't even have. to clean your beaters because it's all going in the same pot. - [Teresa] Got you a bigger bowl. I don't know if you need it.. - Oh no, this is fine. I could stand some new eyes. (laughs) There, okie dokey. So I'm gonna start with a eight. ounce bar of cream cheese. And I'm gonna just beat it a little bit, just get it a little softer. (beater whirs) It's good, Teresa. - [Teresa] Paula, one. of the questions said. - Yeah. - [Teresa] One of the. questions we get a lot is how do you know they're done because you still want 'em to be gooey? - You know, that is the, that is where people have a. great opportunity to overdo it. Because when you shake that pan, it should still be a. little loose in the center because after it cools, you know, it's gonna harden back up, but just don't overcook it. Start watching it close,. that last five minutes and you should be good. All right so now I'm gonna add two eggs. The crust just takes one egg. and the filling takes two. Because that helps set the gooey filling. (beater whirs) Okay. Putting that egg in first. will keep me from eating it, 'because I don't like the. thought of eating raw eggs. So that works out good. (laughs) - [Teresa] Look how. pretty those yolks are, I mean the color is just beautiful. - Beautiful, bright orange. Yeah, I can't hardly wait. to get our chickens back. I can't hardly wait. All right, we've got our two eggs with a eight ounce. package of cream cheese. Now I'm gonna add one. pound of powdered sugar. Okay? And then we're gonna add our butter and we're gonna add our lemon juice because remember this is a lemon lavender. So we've got to bring in. that lemon flavor to it. You know, the grocery stores. makes a lemon cake mix, but I have tried it and to me it tastes very, very artificial. So I don't know, maybe they've. changed their recipe for it but I just found that it was. too artificially tasting. So if you want lemon, I. would suggest doing it just like I'm gonna do. by adding the lemon juice and the zest. Look at that, how pretty that is. Beautiful. All right. Now I'm gonna add the juice of two lemons. Just beat that in. So these are gonna be nice and tart. That makes me wanna make. a lemon meringue pie. You remember that lemon. meringue pie, Eddie that I'll make once in a while with that Swiss meringue?. - Yes, yes. - Lord have mercy. That thing will make you. talk back to your mama. You'll want to make sure. that you go around your bowl, scraping everything back down in here. So it'll all get mixed up real good. And I'm gonna stir in our lemon zest because like I was talking about earlier, the zest will get caught. up in your beaters and you'll lose some of it and. I don't like losing my zest. All right, now I'm gonna add. our stick of melted butter. All right, now I'm gonna add my vanilla. You know what? I'm gonna have to shut this thing off. The sugar in the vanilla, you know, kind of makes those tops kind of sticky. Teaspoon full. We're almost there, kids. (beaters whir loudly) That looks just like lemon pie. All right. And last, this is the zest. from two large lemons. Watch it (indistinct) go in our mix. That's what happened. that day I dropped that little glass ramekin. in the cake at Oprah's. It's slick. (laughs) Okie dokey. And I do love the zest in there. Okay, so that is it. Now we're just gonna pour. this on top of our crust. And I'll make it come down a little bit with that crust. Go, Teresa, you can have everything I got. - [Teresa] I hate that. but I like to keep it (indistinct).. - No. - [Teresa] So people can. to see what you're doing. - That's exactly right. No, you are perfect. Theresa was just telling me. we've been together 19 years and I still love her. (laughs) - Ooh, that's a job too. (laughs) - I ain't heard her say well, I loved you back.. - Of course, I love you. Oh my gosh.. (laughs) - I didn't hear her say that, did y'all? (laughs). - Of course I do, oh my Lord. It's like family.. - I know, it truly is. All right. This is a thinner batter. because of the lemon juice. You know we don't usually. put any liquid in it besides the butter. - [Teresa] Is that gonna affect anything? - No. Might affect me eating more of it. (laughs) Thinking it's too thin. Look at that, that's just beautiful. - The oven's ready.. - And we're gonna get every bite of it out. All right so Teresa,. - Yes, ma'am. - this may be ready in. 40 minutes, maybe 45. - [Teresa] Okay, well. we're gonna put it at 35 and start looking. - Yeah. And maybe we can shoot inside the oven when I think it's ready. and I can jostle it and kind of show people, you. know what it should look like. - Absolutely.. - Because that is the biggest mistake. - [Teresa] And we get that question all the time.. - Is over cook it. And with it being called. gooey butter cake, you know people tend to think, well a. cake is not supposed to jiggle, but this really should be called. - Gooey.. - Gooey butter cake squares. Rather than cake.. - Well it's heavy, so I'm gonna get it for you. (laughs) Okay. So we'll come looking at. you in like 40 minutes, 35 or 40 minutes. We're getting closer, y'all but because of the extra liquid in it it's a little thinner, you can see that, that's still, I'm gonna run. that for about 10 more minutes and then we'll take another peak at it. But we're sure gonna. try not to overcook it. You twisting your butt, not the pan. - [Teresa] I know, but. you're supposed to talk. (laughs) There it is.. - You're shaking your little hiney. Yeah, that's what you doing. See that?. - Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. - [Paula] Hold your arms straight, and I'll do the jiggling. for you, how about that? - [Teresa] There we go. - So that's what it. should look like, y'all And when it cools it'll. stay together, I promise. Now how long did we wind up cooking that? - This was actually for 45 minutes. - It was. Because, here I'll get. the oven door for you. - Thank you. - Because we put it back on, what'd you start it at, Teresa? - I started it at 35.. - 35, - And then we checked it.. - then we added 10 more minutes, so 45 minutes. - Which is what the recipe says. - Yes. Our lavender lemon gooey. butter cakes are ready and 45 minutes was the. magic number for this one. Now that's without knowing. how your oven runs, that would be up to you. But 45 minutes was perfect in mine. And you saw the little jiggle the little wiggle jiggle it did? And the more this cools,. the easier it's gonna slice. Oh my gosh, Eddie. And it's so rich that. you don't need, you know, a huge piece. - [Eddie] I know that piece that we've got down in Panama City, I think I ate off that for like two days. - You did.. - Just a little at a time. - I pinched a little bit off, but by time I got to. it, it's a little old. All right so do y'all. see what that looks like? See how it's gooey looking? It's a perfect goo. And I just happen to have a little bit of fresh whipped cream. So look at that. Look at that, Teresa. Poor baby, now, when you gonna. be able to eat sweets again? - [Teresa] 12:01 Sunday morning. - Are you stay up Saturday night 'til 12:01?. - Probably not, but I may. - Well, I wish you could. take a bite of this with me. - [Teresa] I might have to make my own. - Well, you know what? This will still be good. 'til Sunday night, so. - Sunday morning.. - Sunday morning. I'm going need that, Teresa. I'm gonna need that,. that's why I left it out. 'Cause I'm doing a cooking. show, do you know it? - I didn't know that.. (laughs) Can you taste the lavender? - I was gonna say the. lavender is very faint. I really am more ready for. Eddie to taste it rather than me because he is such a big fan of lavender. - [Teresa] Why don't. you hand me that thing. - Okay.. - And you go right on over and taste it. - Yeah, let me.. - Too bad. - [Paula] Let me get him a fork. - [Teresa] Come on Eddie. - 'Cuz you can taste the lemon. - I think. - What?. - The. - You can't eat some of these? - Oh yeah, I can eat some of that. - [Teresa] The whipped cream. might also be taking a little. - I got you a clean fork. - I think I could eat just the base. It looked like it was. gonna be a cookie and some. - Here. Let me cut it for you. - Yeah. The lemon really takes over.. - Micheal and I love this. Yeah, it kind of does, doesn't it? - [Teresa] So would you add. more lavender or cut out? - No I would say.. - Lemon? - Omit.. - Yeah, yeah. Or maybe do just.. - One lemon. - Or just the maybe grate some lemon rind. - [Teresa] So just the zest,. we did put zest in there. So it has zest and juice.. - Yeah, it's got the gest. - Gest.. - Look, I sound like Aunt Peggy.. - The gest. - She said you've got the. gest of it right, Paula? Or no, no. I was cooking one day and she said do you want me to gest that? God love her. She's a hoot and a half. - [Teresa] So I'm gonna adjust. the recipe just as an FYI. And put just the zest in there. and not the lemon, agreement? - Yeah. Or if you really want. lavender, just do the lavender. - Just do lavender, eat up, Eddie. - Actually, you know what?. - What? - I could taste it now. It's an after taste, yeah.. - Oh, okay. (laughs) - Took a second. - His tongue. Yeah, I'm tasting it,. I'm really tasting it. - Yeah.. - So. - Yeah, so it's a two for one. You get the lemon first and then the rind. - I would probably recommend that y'all go right by the recipe the first time. And then you decide and then do it the way your. tongue wants you to do it the second time. Eat up, Eddie, 'cause I don't. want to have to do this. I've sacrificed enough, man.. - I'm gonna take it. (laughs) - It's a wonder my eyes are not brown. (laughs) Y'all know I'm talking about?
