- Come on in the kitchen y'all because I have a recipe from a fan out there that calls this a diabetic coma cake. And I don't think he means it keeps you from going into a diabetic coma. I think he means it will send. you into a diabetic coma. It sounds wonderful. This recipe was sent in. to me from Jeffrey Bridges and he was just so cute. with his little letter. He told me that... He wrote and he said that he. has a recipe from his grandma that he would just love for me. to have if I was interested. Well, of course I'm interested. I love hearing from y'all and knowing what your grandmothers or your mothers did for you. So he told me, he said, "Call me if you have any. questions about making this cake." Did I tell y'all the name. was a banana fruit cake, which doesn't sound like... Don't think it's a fruit. cake 'cause it's not. 'Cause I'm not crazy about fruitcakes but you know what? He sent me his phone number. If I can find it. Oh, here it is. (phone beeping) I bet he won't answer. 'cause it's going to come in not recognizable or something like that. - [Theresa] Or he might be at work. - Yeah. But maybe it says cell number. (phone ringing) You know, I know one. thing, nobody can talk about me and butter anymore. (laughs) As long as... - [Voicemail: Jeff] Hey,. you've reached Jeff. Leave your name and number after the tone and I'll get back to you. as soon as I can, thanks. - [Voicemail Prompt Voice] At the tone, please record your voice message. When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press. pound for more options (beep). - Hello Jeffrey. It's Paula Dean and I knew you. wouldn't pick up your phone. You tell me that you're. not a weird person, that, laugh out loud,. I'm just a funny gay guy. Well, I still like to think I'm just a old funny straight girl. So we make a good pair. All right, let's see. Please let me know when. she will be making this. I would like it dedicated. in the memory of my grandma, Grandma French. So Grandma French was heavy. into the butter as well. So Jeffrey, I'm so sorry. that I couldn't get you, dear but I wanna thank you for. sending in the recipe, and I'm making it right now, and I'm showing your recipes, I'm sharing your recipe. for Grandma French cake, banana fruit cake. I am sharing that with all. of our friends out there. So thanks Jeffrey. Sorry I missed you. Bye bye. Too bad, I wanted to talk to Jeffrey. All right, what is this? It takes so many. different pairs of glasses just for me to get the job done, I can't remember. All right, so I'm gonna. do what Jeffrey said. He didn't tell me about. the bananas, you know. But, you know, I think. I'm gonna throw those into the mixer instead of mashing them. I think I'll just... (mixer whirring) I'll do it this way. And he said, "add all your. wet ingredients together." So I'm gonna to beat that up. Mash those up pretty. good and pretty quick. And I like this cake. because we're gonna cook it in a 13 by nine by two. Jeffrey said, "Cook it. in an 11 by nine pan." I don't know about 11 by nine pans, so I'm gon' cook it in a 13 by nine pan. And I like that because that means I just don't have to put a cake together. You know, like two or. three layers together. All right, I'm going to. add my two cups of sugar. I'm gonna add two eggs and Jeffrey said that he... This is what he did different. from his grandmother. He said he separated his eggs and he beat his whites. until they were stiff. But I'm not doing that Jeffrey. I'm gon' do like your Grandma said. Not that I don't trust you. (laughs) I'm just going to follow Granny's rules. All right, so... two sticks of melted butter y'all. I love it. (mixer whirring) I'm gonna add that kind. of on the slow side. So it won't get all over me. All right, so I have two. and half cups of flour that I'm running through my little sifter, and I've got two teaspoons. of baking soda right here, and Jeffrey says to add three. tablespoons of hot water, and this is pretty hot. Now let me make sure I. don't have the ingredients back asswards mixed up. Two teaspoons of baking soda and three tablespoons of hot water. So I just took this water. out of the microwave, so it's good and hot. I mean, this is really an. easy cake to make, Jeffrey. All right, so I am going to... Sift. I think it's a half a teaspoon of salt. Can you shove that over. to me please, Eddie? Skank ya. All right. Yeah, half a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, one teaspoon of ground cloves. Yep, that's the cloves, and then one teaspoon of nutmeg. And that's the nutmeg. All right, let's see. And then you're gonna add to that one cup of chopped walnuts, but I'm outta walnuts. and we're using pecans, which is perfectly okay. And Jeffrey said one cup of. raisins that are optional. So that was two cups of sugar, two eggs, six ripe bananas that are almost brown, two teaspoons of baking soda, and three tablespoons of hot water, a half a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon,. ground cloves, and nutmeg. And then we're substituting. the walnuts for our pecans, a cup of raisins, one cup of melted butter, and three and a half cups of flour. So, I'm gonna sift those spices into the rest of the flour. And Jeffrey said to just slowly, slowly add this to our wet ingredients. You know what? When Michael and I married... When Michael and I got married, his favorite cake in the whole world was a banana nut cake. with cream cheese icing. So, the groom's cake was banana nut bread. So Jeffrey, this sounds. a lot like Michael's... one of Michael's favorite cakes. So he is gonna love this. I need my little chute the side. of this but I don't have it. All right, so mix, mix, mix. And then we'll have to stop. and stir down our sides. There, I don't know why I did. it on this side a minute ago 'cause y'all can see. that side much better. Okay, I'm going to try not to get my... My spatula in the beater. Okay. It's smelling good. (phone ringtone). Who's phone is that? Tell them we don't want any. (laughs) We busy. (dog barking) Hey, hey, hey! All right, I'm gonna go ahead. Y'all hush. I'm gonna go ahead and add, y'all, my two teaspoons of. baking soda and hot water. And then, I'm just going to stir my nuts and my raisins in the cake. Those spices, do you smell them, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes! - You know, nutmeg and cloves, they're very strong spices. And what I'm mainly. smelling is the nutmeg. - [Eddie] It smells a lot. like the essential oils that we burn in the kitchen. - Oh yeah, yeah. Sometimes I'll think Eddie's. in the kitchen cooking, but he's just in here burning. things in our little... Oil things. It smells so good. - [Eddie] It's less calories.. - Less calories (laughs) It darn sure is less calories, now, 'cause I ain't had the urge. to go over there and eat that one, not one drop. All right. (mixer whirring) Whoa! All right, I'm going to cut this up, cut that off, and let that beater up so I can get in here and. really clean up the sides of this cake. It's going to be a big fat cake, Eddie. Mmm, smells so good. - [Theresa] That might be. why it takes an hour to cook. - Yeah.. (mixer whirring) And what did he tell us to. bake it on, Theresa, 350? - [Theresa] Bake it on 350,. (mixer drowns out speaker). - [Paula] Okay, well I'm not, I'm going to make sure. that it's not on convection 'cause I didn't, I don't want. the bottom to get over brown. Okay, those bananas make your. batter very, very sticky. See how sticky that looks? All right, a couple more spins. Then we're going to have Granny. French's cake in the oven. Gonna be hard to wait an hour. I'm about to swallow my. tongue right now. (laughs) All right, I'm going to spray my pan. This way we don't need to. worry about turning this out. So it'll live in that pan. until the cake's gone. All right, I'm gonna try to just turn that batter out. So that's pretty good, most of it. Most down it slung off. Just so I won't make a mess, I'll get rid of that. And now I'm going to stir in a cup of nuts and a cup of raisins. And I do love raisins. I love raisins in my cakes. So if you want a plump, plump raisin, you can soak these in hot. water and they'll just puff up, and they'll just become. real tender and big if you want them puffed up, but I'm not puffing these up. 'cause that doesn't matter to me because I just love that little chewy sweet bite of raisin. Okay. So Jeffrey, I hope I've. done it to suit you honey. So here we go into the pan. - [Theresa] Yum.. - [Paula] Huh? - [Theresa] I said yum - Do you want to lick the. bowl, Theresa? (laughs) I think Theresa would. rather have the batter than the actual cake. - [Theresa] You've got it. - Okay. (bowl clangs) Get you some Theresa. - [Theresa] That's unusual. for you to even leave that. - This is going to be a. very, very dense, heavy cake. Very heavy. I can tell just by the. way the batter feels. - [Eddie] So can you tell the difference? What's different about. this from your banana cake? - You know, I don't know, Eddie. Did you taste it, Theresa?. - [Theresa] Not yet. - Well, I didn't hear you... - [Theresa] I'm preserving. the moment for a little while. - You know, when I give. Linton a cookie that he likes, he says, "Mm-hmm!", and he will come up to me and say "mmm" until I say it. (Theresa laughs) That boy appreciates guineas cookies. This is a delicious batter. Mmm, mm, mm, mm. So, we're going to set. the timer for one hour. And if it doesn't turn out. it's Jeffrey's fault. (laughs) Okay, Jeffrey baby. It's time to frost your banana fruit cake. And I'm telling you what,. honey, this is one dense cake. I mean, feel how heavy it is Eddie, put out your other hand. - [Eddie] Yeah, it's... - I mean, it's dense. It's very heavy. Did you feel it? Yeah. - No, I pilled it, see you. could do a workout with that. - Yeah, I know! So I can't wait to taste it Jeffrey. And you know, I tried to call you earlier, (mixer whirring) but you wouldn't take my call. - [Theresa] Bet he's. going to regret that one! - You know, I got a private phone number so it wouldn't give you a number, and I said, people are. not answering phone calls from unidentified numbers. And I don't blame you a bit. All right, so I have got two sticks of softened butter that I've whipped up, and now I'm adding one. box of powdered sugar per Jeffery's directions. And it calls for one tablespoon of milk. So I'm going to go ahead and add that and see if that will help me incorporate that butter into that. powdered sugar better, and oh, it does. See how it's doing? A little liquid goes a. real long way, y'all, with powdered sugar. Okay, you know, I might as well stop now and add our tablespoon of vanilla. I keep wondering why the, why. this light is bothering me. 'Cause I don't know which. pair of glasses to put on. So there, I've got the best. of both worlds. (laughs) All right, so Jefferey tells me to add this mixture, which is two. tablespoons of very hot water to the three tablespoons. of an instant coffee. And he said just add that,. well now I don't need those. He said just add it slowly until the icing is creamy and that coffee smells delicious. (mixer whirring) Oh, it's going to be a. caramel color, y'all. Look at that. That looks just like caramel icing. - [Eddie] Like a tiramisu. - [Paula] Uh-huh, yeah. All right, so more coffee. This would be good with. some coffee ice cream. This cake. Jeffrey said to pour this. icing on the top of the cake. - [Theresa] I don't think that's pouring. - [Paula] I just can't imagine, you know, this pouring out of the bowl 'cause it's really kind of thick. So, hope I hadn't done. anything wrong, Jeffery. (mixer whirring) - [Eddie] Okay, if the coffee. was supposed to be poured over the cake, then the frosting. - [Paula] No, no, he said last add this and beat until it's creamy. Eddie, uh oh, (laughs) a little slinging (mixer drowns out speaker) Stick your finger in. - [Eddie] That's good.. - [Paula] That is good. - [Eddie] If you're a coffee drinker. - [Paula] If you're a coffee. drinker, you are gonna love it. And you know what? I like cakes. In a 13 by nine by two pan. 'Cause you're so easy to frost. No guessing whether you got enough in the bottom layer or the middle layer. Mmm, Theresa, do you like coffee? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - Well, stick your finger. in that for a second. - [Theresa] I will do it at the top so I won't really get it into anything. - [Paula] Okay, okay good. - [Theresa] Wow. - [Paula] Isn't that good? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm, that's very good. - [Paula] Yes, now you know what? I might like some more nuts. sprinkled on top of that cake. - [Theresa] Is that a hint to me? - [Paula] No, I was just. waiting for y'all to say un-uh, it doesn't need that, or yeah! - [Theresa] I'm not as big. of a nut person as you are. - [Paula] I am a nut. I am a nut lover. - [Theresa] Everything we cook. - [Paula] Uh-huh, got to have my nuts. - [Theresa] Eddie, are you a nut lover? - [Eddie] Yeah. - [Theresa] You like them. Would you put nuts on top of that? - [Eddie] Sure. No, when she said that,. I was trying to think what kind of nuts would be good on that. - [Paula] I mean, would you want a nut with that coffee flavor? Maybe not. - [Theresa] Well, you're. going to have it in the cake. So, might be too many flavors. - [Paula] Yeah.. - [Theresa] Competing. - [Paula] Yes. - [Eddie] You could put like. chopped, chocolate covered- - [Theresa] Well, you. know, the other thing is this is a pretty strong coffee flavor. So like, if you didn't want. it to be this strong coffee you could probably put a, you could lighten up the amount of instant coffee you put in. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Theresa] Taste that Eddie. - [Eddie] I've had it. - [Theresa] You already tasted it? - [Paula] All right, who's ready? - [Theresa] I can't believe. Michael's not already here. - [Paula] I know it, Jeffrey. Wait, I hear flip flops. - [Theresa] I do too. And speak of the devil! - [Paula] (laughing) We're. just fixing to cut the cake. - [Michael] I smelt it. - [Paula] This your banana cake. Oh Micheal, you're not. going to believe this cake. - [Theresa] But this. is a different version. Different version. - [Paula] It's a different version, but, I think it's going to taste much like your groom cake tasted.. - [Michael] Oh, good. - [Paula] So come over here and... - [Theresa] The groom cake. didn't have a coffee flavor, though, did it? - [Paula] No,. - [Theresa] Yeah, so - [Paula] No, but the cake part- - [Theresa] The coffee flavor's going to be just a little bit different. - [Paula] Yeah, but the cake part. So, come get your cake. - [Michael] I was so. excited on the reception, I don't even remember what it taste like. (Paula laughing) - [Theresa] He's trying to butter you up. - Well, well it ain't working. - [Theresa] 17 years later. - Yeah, (laughs) all right. - [Michael] I love it. - [Paula] Ooh! Jeffrey. That looks pretty good. The banana smell will knock you down. Smell Eddie. - [Eddie] I can smell it. - [Paula] You can smell it from there? - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. - All right Michael. - [Theresa] Come taste the first piece. - [Paula] So this is. Jeffrey's diabetic coma cake. - [Theresa] Only on special occasions. - [Michael] I'm going to take this one that's got more icing. - [Paula] Okay, you. take any piece you want. - [Michael] I don't know. - [Paula] (laughs) Why don't you eat two? All right, here it goes. Y'all get your cake. - [Theresa] I'm coming, I. want to see Michael's face. - [Michael] All the girls do. - Wow. It tastes as dense as it looks. - It's good. - Mm-hmm. - I get my fruit this way. - [Theresa] Bananas and raisins. - The banana flavor is very good in it. And it's tasty with the icing. The icing makes it. - Delicious. - Thank you Jeffery. Love you. Best dishes.
