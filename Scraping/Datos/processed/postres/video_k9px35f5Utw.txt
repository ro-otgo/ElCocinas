- Hey, y'all welcome to my kitchen. Paula's kitchen. I am real excited about. sharing this recipe with y'all today. I hope you've never had it, so you can have the fun with. it that I've had with it. I'm fixing to show y'all. how to make cheese fudge. It sounds crazy, I know. But it is so good. And I want to show y'all what I've got back here on the stove. The cheese is this. I know I'm not supposed to show brands, but it is what it is. And this is an eight ounce bar and that's what the recipe calls for. And it calls for, hey boys, y'all stop. Stop. Stop. They're fixin' to gang up on. little Max, poor little Max. We have two sticks of butter in here and an eight ounce block. of Velveeta cheese. We're just gonna melt these together. And the cheese takes a little longer than the butter, naturally. And you just need to. keep a close eye on this. I'm gonna turn it up a little bit. And then we're just gonna. wait for that cheese to melt. Okay, y'all it's all melted. It does take a few minutes to melt it. And like I said, you might could put the. cheese in there first, cause it takes a little bit. longer and let that melt. All right now to our cheese. We're gonna add our nuts. And our vanilla flavoring. And you know, I like, I. like my vanilla flavoring so I'm gonna do two cap fulls. And in this bowl over here, I'm gonna put in, let's. see how many ounces, anyway, this equals like two. boxes of confection sugar. It's wanna stick to the sides. Thank you, Eddie. Eddie's a mind reader. He knows what you want. 'for you ask for it. Two pounds of confectionate. sugar in the bowl. And I tell you to sift it, what'd I do with my whisk? Is it sitting up there. and I just can't see it? No, here it is. All right and it says to. sift your powdered sugar and your cocoa together, but actually, I just use my whisk and that's. so very close to sifting. See how that's mixing. it all together and-- - [Eddie] I bet this ends up being kind of like Swiss fudge, doesn't it? (laughing) - [Paula] Kinda. - [Eddie] I bet. I was skeptical at first. And I'm still a little skeptical. - [Paula] You're not. gonna believe it, Eddie. - [Theresa] You've never had cheese fudge? - [Eddie] Uh uh. - [Theresa] Oh my gosh. - [Paula] Well you know how long it's been since I made it? - [Theresa] Well I must. have had it 'cause I-- - [Paula] I think it was. before I ever met Michael. It's been a long time. Hey little Mike, you like fudge? - Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Do you like nuts? I can't remember. - No ma'am. - [Paula] You don't like nuts. Dadgumit, I wanted you to taste my fudge. - I don't know if I can. help you on that one. - Okay, so in that goes. and this is gonna be very, very, very, very thick. Gonna make sure I get every bit. (laughs) This recipe just makes me laugh. Just pure makes me laugh. (dogs barking) Hush, hush, hush. - [Theresa] Shush, come here, come here. - Hush. It's probably Henry. Our grandsons are staying with us, John and Henry, for a couple of days, while their parents are out of town. And Michael had to actually. go pick Henry up from school 'cause he had a stomachache. - [Theresa] I think he's playing hooky. - I think he might be taking advantage of Poppa and Ginny's (laughs) feelings. For lack of a better word. - [Theresa] That's what grandparents do. - [Paula] Listen, they know. (dogs barking) Hush. - [Theresa] Come here. - [Paula] I'm sure it's Henry, getting up out of the bed. and walking around, Theresa. All right, so when you make this y'all, you may want to make. sure you got a strong man around the house. Because it takes a while. to get all this blended. Look at that. - [Eddie] Sure does look good. (laughing) - Doesn't that look good? It is good. And I've had so much fun with this recipe, Eddie, over the years. Mike, would you do me a favor? Would you wash your hands and come stir my fudge, please? - [Mike] Yes ma'am. (laughing) - I've had so much fun with. it over the years, y'all. I remember the first time I made it, I lived at Turner's Creek. I didn't know who Michael Groover was, that's for sure. But, I took it to my neighbors and I said, "Now I want you to. taste it while I'm here. I want you to taste it while I'm here, 'cause I want you to tell me what you think is in this fudge. How I made this fudge." Well, nobody guessed it right, nobody. And when I told 'em, they just, you could have knocked. 'em over with a feather. They said, "There is just no way that that can be fudge." Thank you baby, my arm's about shot. - Getting a workout. - Y'all, this is Mike Pryor. He is a part of our team here. And a very important team member. - [Mike] Thank you ma'am. - [Paula] In case I. hadn't told you lately. - [Mike] All the time. - [Paula] So get in there. and stir it up good, baby. - [Mike] Okay. - [Paula] This arm's about. to fall off from stirring. - [Mike] I believe it. - [Paula] From stirring. the cheese and the butter and then stirring the fudge. There's Henry and Poppa. I knew, the dogs were just going crazy. And I just knew it was. y'all, up walking around. How you feeling, Henry? - [Henry] A little bit better. - [Paula] Good. Thank you, darling. - [Mike] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] I appreciate it. - [Mike] You tell me when it's good. - Okay, it's good, I think. I can finish it from there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - [Mike] You're welcome. - It's so nice to have a young. man around the house, y'all. All right, so I'm just gonna. go around that bowl now with a spatula. - [Michael] That's why you married me. - [Paula] Yes, that's why I married you. Where were you when I needed you? - [Michael] You have a young man-- - [Paula] Huh? - [Michael] You have a. young man around the house. - Young man, my. I'm telling you what, you. must not have a mirror in your bathroom. (laughs) Just 'cause he's nine years younger. You still an old man. All right, see how long it takes to, now what I would like to do, but I'm not gonna do it today. What I would like to do. is make another batch and make it peanut butter and put that on top of the chocolate so you'll have peanut. butter and chocolate. Michael, have I ever. made this cheese for you? I mean this fudge, for you? (laughs) Say. - [Michael] I think. once, about 20 years ago. - [Paula] Yeah, I mean. it's been a long time since I made it. Okay, and then I'm just, and like I said, I didn't grease this dish because it has two sticks of butter in it. I think that's enough to. keep it from sticking. And because of that butter. If the butter appears to come to the top, you can take a paper towel and pat it out. And if there's any excess. butter coming to the top. So make this and give. some to your neighbors or your friend and get them to tell you what's in this fudge. And I'll bet you a dollar to a donut, that nobody will say Velveeta cheese. And this doesn't take. but a second to cut it. I just put it in the refrigerator just for a minute, look at that. (slapping) Viola. We gonna let it chill and then we'll come back and taste it. I can't wait for Eddie to taste it. Probably not more than 10 or 15 minutes and it's gonna be so hard, but you know what Eddie, I just can't hardly wait. for you to taste it. So I'm gonna go ahead and, you're not opposed to a soft-- - [Eddie] Melted fudge? - Piece of fudge, are you? - [Eddie] Melted cheese fudge. - Yes, all right so taste it and tell me. - [Eddie] Yeah. - [Theresa] Can you taste the cheese? You cannot, can you? - No. - [Eddie] No. No. - [Theresa] You would never know. - So how good is it? - [Eddie] It's really good. - [Theresa] You'll be taking some to your room tonight, won't you? - [Eddie] Yeah, I mean it's-- - [Theresa] You'll be taking some home. I know you will. - [Eddie] It's just like fudge. - I know, it's incredible. No fail. No fail, no fooling, no fail. - [Henry] Am I allowed to have fudge? - [Eddie] Velveeta. (laughing) - Y'all have as much fun with this recipe as I've had with it over the years. I took a long break from. it but I'm glad to be back.
