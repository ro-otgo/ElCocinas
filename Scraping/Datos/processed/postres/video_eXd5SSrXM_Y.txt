- You know, I love a state fair. Doesn't everybody love a state fair? And you can get some foods. that are so bad for you, can't ya? So it's a good thing that we can't just get to. a state fair every weekend, but you know those little. things that they fry up that has that Oreo. cookie in the center? We know we're not. supposed to be eating 'em, but isn't it so good? And uh, I don't even think Georgia has. a state fair, do we, Theresa? We don't have a state fair, do we? - [Eddie] We used to. have the Savannah Fair, but I don't even think. we have that anymore. - Yeah, but that's not a state fair. A state fair is huge. And I have been to state. fairs that are just. - [Eddie] We've been to the Minnesota one a couple times, but that's. - We did, you and I did? - [Eddie] You, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I know I spoke at one of 'em. - [Eddie] Yeah, actually I think you've done the air fryer or some. air fryer demos there. - Did a demo? Oh, yeah. (Paula laughing) Probably did. Well, I'm gonna make us. some little fried Oreos, and you can use, to do these, you can use, I'm using puff pastry, but. you can also use those, that dough that you buy in the can. What is it, what is it? Crescent roll dough, yeah. So you can also use that. I've just always been a. big fan of puff pastry. So I'm cutting these, I'm using my largest biscuit cutter, and I'm stretching my dough. out even a little bit bigger. And I'm taking my double. stuffed Oreo cookie, and I'm just bringing the. dough up around that cookie. Just kind of mashin' it down. And I'm gonna leave this side up, and almost make it like. a little beggars' purse, so there we go. And I'm sealin' it with. just a little bit of water to make it tacky. So that's what y'all caught me doing. And the fair that we have here in the Southeast Georgia Fair, Eddie. I don't think I've seen fried. - [Eddie] Yeah, it's. - Oreos there. Have you? - [Eddie] No, but I definitely remember the Minnesota one, there. was fried everything. - Fried everything. I remember years ago when I, it didn't start out to be that, but by the time I ended up with the show, I was making a cheeseburger,. and I did not like making, my bread wasn't fresh. And of course I had a guest on the show, and I didn't want to. give her a cheeseburger with hard bread. So I had a plate of donuts,. Krispy Kreme donuts, sitting up there on the counter. So I touched it, and oh, it felt so fresh. So I said we are gonna have. our cheeseburger on this donut. Well, I took two of those donuts, and just dressed 'em the same way I would have dressed a cheeseburger on a bun. that was the best hamburger. I've ever tasted, y'all. In fact, I went back into the bedroom. I asked 'em if we could cut for a minute, I went back into the bedroom. where Michael was sleeping, he had worked all night, bringing in and parkin' ships. And I said, Michael,. you just got to wake up long enough to taste this, because I won't be. making any more of these. These are like a once in a lifetime thing. And it was so good, y'all. And before I could turn around, I heard that state fairs were. doing donut cheeseburgers. So it was good enough. for people at the fair to duplicate it. They were just out of this world. So I'm gonna take our Oreo cookies that we have got. encased in this puff pastry, and I'm gonna spray 'em real good. And then I'm gonna put. 'em in the air fryer. I don't know what I did. before an air fryer, y'all, I swear to Peter I don't know. I don't like to think about it. Now let's see, I can't remember, this recipe was in my air fryer cookbook. Let's see, says air fry. for five minutes on 350. So that's what we're gonna do. Five minutes. And we gon' have deep fried Oreos. Now what could we do to make these, give 'em a little twist. What do y'all think we could do? - [Eddie] Frosting, dunk in frosting. - Dunk it in frostin'? Great idea, Eddie. (Paula laughing) Or we could just drizzle it with. - [Theresa] Chocolate? - Chocolate? Yes. What kind of chocolate,. you think like Nutella, or? - [Theresa] Any of 'em. - Any of 'em? (Paula laughing) I would like some nuts in mine. I just love nuts. So gosh, what else could we do? - [Theresa] We could just put. confectioners' sugar in them. Sprinkle 'em. - Yeah. You can mix up confectioners' sugar, and a little chocolate, their powder chocolate that. you use to make frostings with. Mix that together, and dust 'em with that. The chocolate and the,. and the powdered sugar. Yes. So we got five minutes to see what we got. So if you're craving a fried. Oreo from your state fair, and there's no state fair in sight, remember this one, put this. one in your little recipe log. When I first started. filmin' a show, I did it in, at Millbrook up in upstate New York. And there was a state. fair going on up there. around Poughkeepsie or somewhere. Anyway, we went to it. I don't know who I was with. 'Cause I didn't know anybody, but it was, the state. fairs are so much fun. - [Theresa] The big ones. Remember when we went to. the Minnesota State Fair? - Yes, the Minnesota State Fair is huge. - [Theresa] Huge. - Huge. Alright. Let's see. How long has it been now, y'all? Eddie just said it smells. like the state fair in here. And you know what would have made 'em prettier and glossier, Eddie,. that I could have done? I could done it in egg yolks,. brushed 'em in egg yolks. And that would have. given it a polished look. Some of 'em, I didn't. close up all the way. 'Cause I wanted to see how it'd look with a little of the. chocolate peakin' out of it. And that's what it looks. like totally covered. But I like the way they look. like little beggar purses. And I looked for some cocoa, y'all, to mix with some powdered sugar. But, I didn't have any, must be in storage. (Paula laughing) That very well could be in storage. Sure enough, along with my bakin' stuff. I think I like it better. like that, totally closed. So maybe I should eat one. that's not closed all the way. Right? You reckon these are real hot? Yes. (Paula laughing) Yes, they are. - [Eddie] Get a glass of milk. - Mm. (bell dinging) Mm. I do love me a puff pastry. I tell you what. Tell you children what. Then I can't find anything. I can't wait to. I can't find anything. You see this big thing sittin' in my face? I couldn't find it. (plastic crinkling) Gonna put just a little. powdered sugar on it. 'Cause that puff pastry is not sweet. The Oreo cookie is, but, so there we go. Look, here comes Theresa. (Paula laughing) - [Eddie] You could do. like your sand cookies. - Can't her ass out of that chair. - [Eddie] Roll it in powdered sugar like your sand cookies that you had. - [Theresa] Oh yeah. - Oh my gosh, this is so good. Would you like one of. my fried Oreo cookies? - [Theresa] Yes, please. - Well what are you doin'? Eat the whole thing. You know you can eat the whole thing. - [Theresa] I know. I just know it's gonna be hot. Are they not that bad? - Yes, it's hot. - [Theresa] Oh and you know. I got the double stuff. - Mhm. - [Theresa] That's important, a note. - Theresa did go get the. double stuffed Oreos. - [Theresa] And they have. all kind of Oreo flavors now. - I mean! - [Theresa] Peanut butter, mint. - Somebody told me that. they had an almond one. - [Theresa] I mean, it's crazy. - But I can't find it anywhere. And every store I go. in, I look for 'em, and. - [Theresa] You could make. these for St. Patrick's Day with the mint ones. - Mhm. That'd be great. Mm. - [Theresa] Just when you think. a Oreo can't get any better. - We beg to differ, don't we? (Paula laughing) So good, y'all. You know what, you could mix up food colorin', and brush your pastry, whatever you were usin',. either the puff pastry, sheets of puff pastry, or. either the crescent rolls that come in the can. You could brush 'em with food colorin', and make 'em any color you wanted. - [Theresa] That's a good children's, I mean that's so easy. - Uh huh, so easy for a child. - [Theresa] To do. - And then put the sprinkles on it. - [Theresa] Mhm, I mean. you could do a lot with it. - Mm! - [Theresa] And not heat up the kitchen. - No, uh-uh. It's just as cool in here. And, this is one way to beat a state. fair if you ain't got one. (Paula laughing) Isn't it? Love y'all, have a great day.
