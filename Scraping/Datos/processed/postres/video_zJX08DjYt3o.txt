hey y'all i'm paula dean you know there's nothing better than instant gratification and today i want to show y'all some of my favorite dessert recipes that are fast simple and yet scrumptious but before we get to that i want to take y'all to savannah coffee roasters for some fresh beans to complete this bittersweet affair and then it'll be time for us to head back to my kitchen first up is gonna be nutty coconut macaroons after that things are gonna get fruity with my hair savignon and then i want to pay tribute to my friend mae dawson by preparing her famous sugar cream pie and finally my yummy blueberry dumplings so i hope you brought your sweet tooth because desserts are on me today it's all about simple desserts now when we're talking simple desserts there's nothing better than a great cup of coffee and today i'm gonna show you what i drink and it'll pick you up and get your morning going so y'all come with me cause we're gonna go get us some great coffee when i'm serving up a perfect cup of coffee to go with my desserts i always start with a fresh ground coffee bean from savannah coffee roasters now y'all know that here in the south we're big tea drinkers but coffee is fast becoming a partner in our cooking culture and laura the store manager keeps an impressive inventory of over 30 different varieties they carry the finest arabica beans from columbia kenya and jamaica as well as fantastic blends like the good old savannah blend and the good and evil blend after you buy your coffee it's best to keep whole beans stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place like maybe your freezer or refrigerator and the sooner newly ground beans are brewed the better i bet this coffee is gonna be just delicious [Music] this coffee is gonna taste so good today cause it's kinda nippy outside and i can't hardly wait to make it it's gonna be wonderful uh laura was so helpful and you know i decided on the georgia pecan it's gonna taste yummy with the desserts we're making today and before we get started on the coffee though we've got to get these going and the first dessert up is coconut macaroons and they're so simple y'all it takes about 10 minutes so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start by separating our eggs we're gonna do a little meringue to go into our coconut we're gonna start by beating these egg whites and i'm actually saving these yellows because as soon as i finish with this we're gonna be making pear savignon did i say that right sometimes i get real confused with that word my southern tongue will get all screwed up in my mouth so anyway pear savage or something like that y'all all right now i've got my egg whites going and i put just a little prima tarta in that to make them really stiff and while that's going i'm going to come over here this is so easy i'm just using flake coconut that comes in a bag in fact on the back of the bags you'll actually see i'm putting about an eighth a teaspoon of salt you'll actually find a recipe on the bag now i don't know if that one calls for egg whites or not but this is sweetened condensed milk all right now so my egg whites are done so i'm going to turn those off and in my macaroons today i'm going to be adding a couple of teaspoons of almond rather than vanilla i just love the flavor of almond now all we have to do is incorporate that condensed milk with our coconut and it doesn't take but a second all right now we're just gonna fold in our egg whites and like i said that's gonna make it so nice and fluffy and y'all remember i've told you before you just have to pick your days when you're doing meringues because if it's raining outside they just don't want to make so these did so good today because the sun's shining and it's really really dry outside all right so we're just going to kind of fold that in just like that working our spatula down and over like i said the recipes on the bags of coconut may differ and like i said some of them don't even call for the egg whites but i think they do so much better we're gonna spray this lightly so our macaroons will come up easily and i have found that an ice cream scoop works real real well for this but for the time being i'm just going to use two big tablespoons drop them about like that all right i've got the macaroons on our sheet and we're going to put these in a 350 preheated oven and we're going to bake them for about maybe eight minutes i've got those in the oven now and i've got another tray here in this oven and they've been cooking about eight minutes so we're gonna check and see what they look like oh and they look good these are actually a little tinier than the ones i made i think i got a heavy hand with those that i just put in all right let's see how they're gonna do oh yeah they're gonna do nicely don't those look delicious and you saw how little bit of time effort and ingredients that it took to make these wonderful homemade macaroons they're so good i can't hardly wait to have one but we better move on over here and make that savagne i was telling y'all about for this i'm gonna put four egg yolks into the bowl and i'm gonna put oh gosh just a pinch of salt and some foix sugar and i'm just gonna mix that up and this is one of those things that we're gonna have to stir and stay on top of or you'll have a bowl of scrambled eggs so we're gonna have to really really watch and make sure that they don't scramble up on us all right now i'm gonna add a fourth of a cup of cooking cherry but you can use a good drinking cherry if you want to in fact i would suggest that if you've got some on hand but if not the cooking cherry will work fine all right now i'm going to put it over our water and this is something that you're not gonna walk away from so this is the boring part it's gonna take about eight minutes so why don't i take a quick break and when we come back we'll have it ready and um i don't think anybody will miss just one [Music] [Music] hey y'all welcome back and i've got this custard going so good now what we're gonna do now is we're to take this of totally away from the heat and i'm actually going to pour it into another bowl because we're fixing to beat some cream and fold into this and it's going to make it nice and fluffy and i've got a little sweetened whipped cream so we're just gonna fold this into our custard you know you can't go wrong with eggs and sugar and whipped cream see how it's becoming a pretty soft yellow color now that we're mixing the white into it today i'm serving this as a dessert but this is one of those dishes that you could actually serve as a salad if you wanted kind of a sweeter salad with a meal i'm actually using pears that i canned but you can just go to the grocery store and buy the regular canned pears and they'll work nicely for you and you want to make sure that you grab pear halves not sliced pears during pear season this year i actually made some pear preserves and michael and i and just enjoy eating them so much look at that we're just gonna dollop a little bit on there and i've got some fresh mint here and i'm just going to sprinkle a few raspberries on it look how pretty that looks and with no trouble and so simple and so easy to make it's so good while this is very good i'm in a hurry to move on because i want to show y'all a recipe that was sent to me from one of my guests that come into the restaurant her name is carol rudd so she has sent me the recipe for may dawson's hoosier sugar cream pie it's nothing but sweetened whipped cream sugar like a cup and a third of sugar and we're going to use about three quarters of a cup of milk and a little flour so we're just going to give that a stir people send me recipes all the time and i can't tell you how much i love it all right now we're going to pour this into a 9 inch unbaked pie shell now you can make your own crust or you can just use the frozen one like i'm doing and because we're doing simple desserts today i opted to go with the frozen crust because we want to make this quick and easy all right now i've got some butter here and i'm just going to kind of pinch it up and just drop it all over the pie i'm doing it just like carol says she does it and now i'm gonna just grate it with a little nutmeg and this almost makes it taste like an egg custard pie there's nothing like fresh nutmeg it's so much better than the ground kind that you buy at the store all right now i'm going to put this into a 450 degree oven and i'm going to let it bake for about 10 minutes and then we're going to turn the oven down to 350 and let it cook another 25 minutes and it's going to be a little jiggly so you'll want to be careful when you put it in your oven got to have a a steady hand and in the meantime i've already baked another one and i've got it sitting right here and it should be nice and cooled it is it's just just a wee little bit warm but not too much i think we can go ahead and cut it now i'd like to show you all a little trick that i use when i'm cutting pies because you know you can sometimes mess it up trying to get it out so i'm going to show you how i like to get that very first piece out but of course if it messes up that's all right too because then that makes it legal to eat before the family gets to it now some people like their pies cut in eighths some people like their pies cut into sixth i don't have to tell you what we do at my house so all i'm gonna do with these scissors is i'm gonna come in here and i'm gonna snip right through that fold so you can see that the pie just kind of slips away and that makes it easy for me to just slip right in and lift out that piece of pie yum it looks great doesn't it and you know i don't even have any fresh whipped cream to serve on it so you know what i think i'm gonna do i had some custard left over from those pears i'm gonna come over here and i think i'm gonna get just a little bit of that and get me a couple of cherries going here we'll use a little piece of mint on it too just to make me feel like i'm eating my vegetables you know and eating healthy look how pretty that looks oh carol this looks so good it's delicious coming up next y'all blueberry dumplings [Music] [Music] all right y'all it's time to make those blueberry dumplings i just love the word dumplings you know when you hear that word you know it's gonna be decadent and these are we're gonna add a quart of fresh blueberries into a medium-sized saucepan we're gonna add a cup of sugar and for your water now it depends on if you like a lot of liquid with your dumplings you can put anywhere from one cup of water to two and i think i'm gonna use about a cup and a half that looks about right and i'm just going to give that a stir so i'm going to put the lid on so that'll boil faster and the next thing we're going to do is just make up our dumplings and it's so easy it's just not even funny we're gonna start with about a cup of flour a teaspoon of baking powder a little bit of sugar and just a pinch of salt and i'm gonna just incorporate those for a minute and then we're gonna cut a stick of butter into that little bit of flour now you can do this a couple of different ways you can use a pastry cutter or you can use a fork and we're just going to kind of cut that in until it looks like a real coarse cornmeal that was a good bit of butter for that little bit of flour wasn't it you know it's gonna be so good let me check on our blueberries cause we can't can't put our dumplings in until our syrup is nice and bubbly we want a full rolling ball when we drop our dumplings in all right so now i'm just going to add the milk and give that a quick stir and they're going to be kind of just a little sticky this is so good on a cool night michael loves a bowl of ice cream but when the weather gets nippy it's nice to make this and you got your hot from your dumplings and your cold from your ice cream it's a great combination all right let's check on our blueberries we're to a nice rolling ball so we're just going to take our dumplings and just drop them down in that liquid it looks like a a grape soda doesn't it [Music] and with dumplings we don't want to stir we want to just shake our pot and get them down in there and make sure they're all covered good all right now i'm going to turn that down a little bit and all we're going to do is put that lid on there and let it cook for about 20 minutes and i'm not going to raise the lid as i'm working here in the kitchen i may just give it a shake but i'm not gonna open it up and stir it or anything but in the meantime i've got another pot ready oh look it's piping hot look at those dumplings is that gorgeous or what um i think i just swallowed my tongue oh my gracious i just love those dumplings i'm gonna get me out one more oh my goodness now you can't eat this without ice cream i just love ice cream with my dumplings and i've got some vanilla ice cream right here and here we go how gorgeous is that and i'm gonna need me a spoon for tasting and i'll cool it off with that ice cream a little bit i wish y'all were here it is so wonderful what am i doing next i can't even remember the perfect cup of coffee to go with this perfect dessert [Music] [Music] and i told you i was going to show you how to make the perfect cup of coffee this is called a french press and it's amazingly fast now we're just going to take our lid off and we have ground up our beans and i'm gonna put three tablespoons in ours now we're gonna take our just boiling water and pour it over our grounds just a little bit and we're gonna let that steep depending on how strong you like your coffee and i'm gonna go ahead and push the cylinder down all right so let's see what we've got oh now that's just the color i like it a nice medium brown you can't get any quicker than this and i've got a little sweetened whipped cream but you can use a frothy milk that's real good on it you know i live with a man that's got the biggest sweet tooth and it's important to me that i have some desserts around for him to eat on without spending my whole day making them michael and michelle his daughter love those coconut macaroons now for those real chocolate lovers in your house you can take these luscious little macaroons that we did and you can dip
