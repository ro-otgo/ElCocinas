hey friends come on in the kitchen because today i am uh sharing a recipe with y'all that uh a friend of mine gave me quite a few years back uh she actually owned the granite still granite steps uh b and b so she was cooking every day for her guests but i know y'all promised them why does paula look decent today well i'll tell y'all why i'm all duded up properly i have this lady right over here to thank emily hey y'all y'all this is emily and she's done my hair and makeup now for how many years about four years now oh my gosh and you just look beautiful so you can trust your makeup artist and your hair person if they have pretty makeup and they have pretty hair you know you can trust them but they've got good taste and emily has incredible taste she can actually turn um a turn to a polished turd she gives me a lot of good materials to work with oh you're so sweet you're so sweet but i know when emily touches me i'm as good as i'm gonna get i'm good to go so i'm so glad you're here and the reason emily is here and why i'm fixed up today is because i don't know how many of y'all know this but i have my own jewelry line and this afternoon i'm gonna be showing my new some of my new jewelry and some of my old favorites and um of course this video the show will be over by the time you get this video but i'm on jtv jewelry tv so anyway i'm gonna share with y'all a recipe that i thought was delicious uh when i lived in my little pre-civil war house downtown on calhoun square and i lived on abercorn the side of my house backed up to granite steps and i became friends with the young woman that's family owned it and uh i just really liked her a lot her name was donna and she was she was funny she was witty and but uh she and her family eventually sold it and they moved on to atlanta to open up uh what was their name over daddy chateau elan yes so i understand that they have a wonderful winery is it a winery any up there yeah so if you're near atlanta you can check that out but donna should you be watching hey girl i've missed you over the last 17 years gosh it's been a long time but anyway donna had to uh prepare breakfast for all of her guests and i guess i was over there one day and tasted this because i i liked it well enough to ask her for the recipe so that's where this comes from all right now we're using one can of big um canned buttermilk biscuits and we're cutting those into fourths and then we have some melted butter that we're gonna dip these in okay so to our half a cup of brown sugar i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and this one's just about empty but there we got a half a half a teaspoon and we're just gonna mix this up good with a fork to make sure that cinnamon gets mixed up with all that brown sugar you know i thought this was a great breakfast or brunch idea because it was so easy to prepare and so tasty all right there we go so i'm going to spray our pan and i i think this is a 9x9 maybe that stuff doesn't taste good to breathe all right so into our melted butter and then into our brown sugar and then we're just going to tuck those close together right in there okay y'all i definitely had to go back and get another half a cup of brown sugar and that's what's left after using a full cup of brown sugar so i'm just tucking these in i finally got them dipped in coated with the brown sugar so we're just going to kind of push those down and now we're going to cover them with a half a cup of quick cooking oats so see this is heart healthy right eddie the top part is i guess if you just eat the oaks off of it oats i call them oaks and like a tree okay so now we're going to take our cup of blueberries and we're going to toss them with a half a cup of sugar and we're just going to toss till it's all that sugar is coated on those blueberries we're taking something very healthy and [Music] making it a little unhealthy right my doctor told me to eat plenty of blueberries but he didn't tell me to eat them coated with sugar all right so i'm just gonna says to spoon them over but i'm just gonna take my hands so hopefully i'll lose some of that sugar i don't think we're gonna need every bit of that [Music] okay this is so good y'all so if you're having company or you're having the girls over for brunch it'll be perfect all right so now we're going to cover that with the last half a cup of our quick cooking oats [Music] and then can y'all guess what we're gonna do next we're gonna pour our butter our other half a stick of butter we're just gonna drizzle that on top and you might need a little bit more butter than just one stick you know in case you use too much on your biscuit pieces yeah it looks good doesn't that look good it's gonna be so good yum all right so we're gonna put this in the oven and donna tells us to uh preheat the oven to 375 degrees and we are going to bake it for 20 minutes or until cake is golden brown and center is done that's not a cake is it yeah it's a coffee cake granite steps country blueberry coffee cake so i stand corrected it's a cake so i'm gonna set the timer for 20 minutes and we'll see what we got okay y'all our granite steps country blueberry coffee cake is out of the oven i mean this thing's stained slower look where i use my hot plate to get it out that blueberry color is hard to get out eddie um so this is still very hot so i hope it'll cut good uh i wound up cooking it it said for 20 minutes y'all i probably wound up cooking it almost 15 minutes longer so you'll just have to watch yours and depend on your oven oh my gosh it brings back so many memories when i lived downtown and donna lived at the granite steps b and b so i hope wherever you are donna that you're doing well and i have fond memories of our talks and our chats and our food this is beautiful it's gonna be hot mm-hmm i'm hot but it is so delicious and like i said i know that's good for me with all those it's got blueberries stuff in it we all
