- Good morning my friends. Welcome to "Paula's. Quarantine Cooking Kitchen!" (Paula laughs) It's my hope that y'all enjoy these and take aside a few minutes every day to just sit and forget about. everything that irks you, and just sit back and spend a. little time with me and relax. You know, good time filler. (laughs) So anyway, I hope y'all are enjoying it. I get so many letters y'all,. so many letters from y'all, and I appreciate each. and every one of them. And to catch y'all up. my eyes are still bad, no makeup, and I feel like I'm standing here in. front of y'all butt naked! (Paula laughs) Without my makeup on, but listen. I got something really,. really, really, really pretty for y'all to look at now. Guess who is gonna be in. the kitchen with me today? My daughter-in-law, and. the mother of my triplets, look, twirl for them. - Okay okay okay.. - Twirl, twirl, okay, come twirl. - Say it again, say it again. - Claudia Deen! (laughs) Oh I love this girl! - I love you too Geni, grandma. - She is a fabulous wife and mother. - Mm-hm. - Uh-huh. - And daughter-in-law. (Claudia laughs) - And daughter, oh, well that. goes without saying I thought. So, she is from Venezuela. - Yes. - So y'all might notice. a little tiny accent. (Claudia laughs) And Claud has been so incredible at feeding our three babies. She has just done an incredible job. Bobby just sent me a video of them eating their oatmeal with a spoon. - Oh yes, oh you saw that? - They are doing so good. - And I think Linton is. gonna be a left-handed. - You think, well I noticed. he was eating with his right. - Well that was my fault, my fault. Because I put the spoon. like this when I served it, so he went for the right hand,. and he did it pretty good, but with his left he's even better. Like I have to have him send. you a video with the left hand. So much better, but I think. he can dominate both now. - I hope that when it's. really come time to choose that he'll choose the right-hand. - No the left one! - Why? - I don't know they say that. left-handed are really smart. - [Eddie] Yes. (laughs) - Are you a left-handed? (Claudia laughs) - My daddy was left-handed. - I'm sure he was really smart!. - But everything... (both laughing). Yes. But everything is made for right-handed people.. - Well, I don't know. - So I'm hoping, Eddie's. just shaking his head no. - Maybe the world needs. to update themselves. (laughing) And do everything. able for everyone. - Well I'm pulling for. a right-handed man, but. - I'm pulling for a left. - Whatever, whatever, whatever. - Just to make it even more. different from the girls he has to be a left-handed. - (laughs) Well I mean, he. can't get any more different than the girls, those. piercing blue eyes this big. And then the girls with. those piercing black eyes, that big. - Well he can be a left-handed, (laughs) to make it even more different. - Every one of them are special. - Yeah, they are special.. - They are so, so special. So Claud has been really innovative in her preparing foods so if there's any of y'all out there, (Paula quietly burps) excuse me, any of y'all out there watching that has a new baby that. you're trying to introduce to foods, y'all will enjoy this. If not, y'all just enjoy. hearing her talk. (laughs) - Everything we make I eat. - Go girl! - Everything we're gonna. make, I eat it at my house. - Okay, so this is not. just for the babies. - No, and actually the. first thing we're gonna do which is an Acai Bowl is very simple is very summery. - Okay. - You're already peeling the bananas. - I'm trying to peel your frozen bananas. - Thank you.. (Paula laughing) But this is something. that I eat for breakfast or as a snack, and actually for the babies I'll do it a little bit different. I just wouldn't add granola on the top because they could choke. But other than that they could. totally eat it as a smoothie. Like as a snack we do a lot of smoothies so this will be an option,. especially now that it's so hot. - So this is a smoothie. for adults or children. - It's a bowl. - It's a what? - A bowl, an acai bowl, so. instead of like smoothie it's gonna be more like an ice cream. - Oh, yay, I'm in! - Yeah.. (both laughing) Not like the one you brought us. - Yes. - Yeah, not like that one,. more like a fruity one, so! Which is still in my freezer by the way and I use it as a food coloring yesterday. - Oh, good! (laughing) - I just mix it with water. - And what were you wanting to, why were you wanting to color food?. - Oh I'll have to show you. Did you see it Eddie? - [Eddie] No. - Okay, I did something. called pouring station. - [Eddie] I did. - You seen it?. - For the babies? - Yeah, yeah, so it's. like, you grab a section like a place where you put different kinds of plastic containers different sizes, different. shapes, whatever. And then you fill them up with. different amounts of water So they say that you can use food coloring so I only had orange food coloring. You can use whatever colors just to make the water different colors. And I was like well I'm. just gonna use Paula's pink ice cream as a food coloring (laughs) So I had pink, it was your. ice cream diluted in water, and then orange, and then. they just grab the cups and they just play with it and try to fill different ones with different... So it's like they learn. the life skill of pouring is what it's for.. - Did they do it well? - Oh yeah yeah yeah, and. they were super entertained because they never done it before so they were there for. solid 15, 20 minutes. Like, you know, doing that. And of course they were. drinking it and all that. - Oh they were? (laughs) - Yeah but it's water, so it's fine. And it's food coloring,. so, but it was a lot of fun so I need to get more food coloring. So anyways, this is for adults. and kids, it's the same. - Okay, okay. - Yeah, like, I will give it, you know. A lot of people, and. we try to do the same, at the beginning we do. more purees and things that are just for them, but right now I want them to eat what we eat. The thing is sometimes. we eat like bunnies. Just a bunch of salads. (laughs) We do other things! So, do you want me to go. through the ingredients? - Yes! - Okay, so. - And does this have a name? - This is a name called Acai Bowl. So this is acai, which is a fruit. But this is frozen. - Okay. - Okay, and you can get this. at any grocery store, so. - And the tip is, let's give. them a tip on this banana. - Well, our sous chef,. not her as my sous chef, Our other sous chef was holding. the phone (Claudia laughs) I forgot to tell him to, you have to freeze the. bananas already peeled. - Yes. - So you are not struggling. like Paula is. (laughs) So when you're gonna use frozen bananas, first peel them and then. put them in the freezer. You can put them in a bowl, or. in a Ziploc bag or whatever. - Okay, well I've never tried. to peel a frozen banana. - You did a great job. - So, (laughing) oh well. thank you, it's pretty messy. - No it looked pretty good. - [Paula] You know those. strings on a banana. - Yeah, I guess they were not that frozen. - [Paula] Holy moly I. couldn't get them off! - Yeah. There it is. That's good.. - [Paula] Okeydoke! - You can get the string. So anyways.. - [Paula] All right, so what were you saying then Claudia? - [Claudia] So this, we're. not using brands right? (Claudia laughs) Bobby every time I say. something he's like, you're doing free. advertising for everyone. I'm like, what that's what I use! (laughs) I like to share the tips of what I use. So anyways. - Well I do too. - Yeah, I mean, doesn't matter. So these acai packs, you can. find them at any grocery store in the frozen section where. the frozen fruits are. - I actually have some in the freezer. - Yeah, I'll be curious to see because... We've made the mistake before of getting the one that is. sweetened, that has sugar and you wanna get, especially. if it's for the kids because this is already. gonna be sweet enough with the banana, you. wanna get the unsweetened. Unsweetened, so always. look at the packages. And make sure that it's unsweetened. So, these are pretty. rough, so what we do first is we're gonna blend these guys first, before we do the banana. So, we're gonna cut it,. with these scissors, that I'm sure is not yours, it's probably one of the kids too. (both laughing) These scissors,. - Oh no, - It's yours?. - I just like that size! - Really?. - Yes. - That's funny. - Yes I just like that size. - Okay, and this blender. - And I use those more than any. other scissors in my drawer. - That's funny. This is a very powerful. blender, already we've seen. - Oh, I'm telling you. It's gonna sound like a rocket going off. - Yeah, sometimes if I,. let's say I freeze them, and then I take them out. for a little bit before you can run them under hot water if you don't have a high speed blender. And sometimes I like. chopping them a little bit before putting them in. there, so it's already... Okay, there we go, now, Miss. Paula is gonna blend it. - Okay. All right let's see, this one has to be. - [Claudia] We're new with this gadget. - Uh-huh. (Blender roars) If you can't mix with. this thing, you can't mix. - How do you open it though? - Just take your top off. - I think I'm gonna break it. I don't wanna upset. Michael, broke his blender. - We're not gonna break it. - You sure? (Blender lid pops). Okay. Oh that's pretty, oh. wow, that is pretty good. - Yeah! - Look. - That thing don't play. - Yeah, wow, this is serious- - Look how many blades. - That's what I was gonna. say, it has like ten blades. - (laughs) Yes. - So you need two of those packages and then two frozen bananas and the more you say riped, or ripened? - Huh? - Riped bananas? - Ripe. - Ripe bananas. - Peeled bananas. - Peeled, peeled, very important. And the more ripe they are, of course the sweeter. they're gonna be, so. You want them to be really riped. - How about, I make my banana nut bread out of over, over ripe bananas. - Oh yeah, it's just sugar. It's just gonna taste even sweeter. - [Paula] Would you want them, could you make this with. really over, over ripe? - Yeah, like that guy over there. Like this, - Like this one? - That one, or even more! - [Paula] All right, how about this one? - Yeah, yeah. - You could? - Oh yeah, that's why, every. time my bananas start turning - Okay so another way to use. old bananas besides just making bread, yeah.. - Banana bread, yeah. And a lot of the times what I do when my, any fruit and even vegetables, when they're turning super ugly I just put them in the freezer and then I put them in smoothies like spinach, when it starts. getting mushy and ugh. I'll just put them in the freezer and then I put them in smoothies. - I mean we have to. - And it's great. - Get this top. - Yeah. - Just right. (Blender roars) Okay y'all, it's ready,. just two ingredients! - Yeah, see how easy, and simple! And delicious.. - What's all that stuff in those jars? - Well that's the fun part. - [Paula] Oh, okay! So we're gonna get. - [Claudia] This is the boring part. - [Paula] Oh okay. - [Claudia] We'll get to the fun part. (Bowls Sliding) - [Paula] So we're gonna get something. - [Claudia] Yes. Oh, that's what I'm nervous. Is it not gonna. - [Paula] Don't be nervous.. - [Claudia] Go down here? - [Paula] I don't think? - [Claudia] Oh shoot. - [Paula] No. - Oh wow, this is something else. - Uh-huh, look at those blades. - Yeah, that's insane. So you've got your delicious, - Uh-huh. - You're really close to. me, I'm like. (laughs) - Hello.. (both laughing) - Okay, and we're just gonna serve it. - Okay, I thought it would be... - [Claudia] I don't know how much. Do you wanna do one,. or do you wanna do two? We'll do two small. I want my own.. - [Paula] Give me a small one. Do me a small one. - [Claudia] Paula's like,. I don't wanna share. - [Paula] Okay, that's good for me. - [Claudia] Plus, let's see, you sure? - [Paula] Yes. - [Claudia] Okay. - [Paula] Well it. depends on what actually- - [Claudia] Ah! (laughs) Let me pour you a little bit more. - [Paula] Mm, that is really good. - [Claudia] Yeah it's so simple. So easy.. - [Paula] I'm gonna take aunt Peggy some back there. - [Claudia] Oh yeah,. you can give her mine. Okay, so.. - [Paula] I'll give her mine. - [Claudia] Okay, so. then comes the fun part. So you can decorate this. with whatever you want and I think this will be. fun if you have older kids because then you can involve them in doing the fun decoration part. So we are gonna cut this,. can we cut here now? We need a cutting? - Yes, no, you can cut there. - Okay, so. - And there's your knife. - My knife, oh, it's. the Deen Brothers knife. - (laughs) Yes it is. - So I like the strawberries. You can do, I mean,. literally whatever you want. This is just what we had. And these strawberries. are really good lately. I thought you wanted a small one. - It's so good and cold and refreshing. I got to give the cameraman some. - So you can decorate. it, well, you're still- - Did you like it? - That's pretty but.. - [Eddie] Yeah, very good. - Then you're supposed. to go, with the camera. - With the camera? (Claudia laughs) - If you don't like it you go. (laughs) - And then we're gonna do bananas. - Oh some more banana. - Yes, bananas are life.. - But what about those jars? - Oh we'll go there. - Oh okay. (laughs) - Patience, we need to learn. - I feel - To be patient.. - Like I'm, - I'm missing something. - Here, you can grab the. bananas that you want. - Okay. - So this is a very cute bowl, small bowl. Okay, try that one. - [Paula] Oh thank you. - [Claudia] And then, we. have the magic powders. So, what we have, I don't. know why I have this because we're not gonna use. it, unless you want to, but. This is flaxseeds. (laughs) - [Paula] Well. - [Claudia] Do it, do it. It doesn't taste like. anything, it's just fiber. - [Paula] No it doesn't, how much? - [Claudia] That's great,. and just sprinkle it. Yes, I'll put it all. around mine too just so. Chia seeds, they have a lot of- - Yeah I like chia seeds. - Omegas and, there we go. - How much?. - They're great. How much, as much as you want. That's the fun part you. can do whatever you want. And then hemp seeds, they. have a lot of protein. So, we want the protein. - How much? - How much, as much as you want. So I always tell the kids, and I always like to. do this, just an idea. I always like to tell. them what they're eating, so every time they're. eating, I start saying okay we're gonna eat this for example and I'm like okay, it has. bananas, and it has strawberries which are full of vitamins and minerals and they're great for your health and the banana has a lot of potassium so we don't get dehydrated and then I'll go like, and I also put, we're. also gonna have hemp seeds that have a lot of. protein for your muscles so you can grow strong,. they're one and a half but I- - That's all right, if you. talk to them like an adult and explain things, you're. so far ahead of the game. - Yeah I know they'll understand, and I told them, and this has flaxseeds! (laughs) And that is granola. - y'all went out in. the yard the other day. - Oh yeah. - Tell me how much. - I like it, so a lot,. I mean, not a lot, but. That's good so they can. see the final product. - [Paula] Okay. This looks like something that I would like a whole lot. (laughs) - [Claudia] Yeah it's delicious. Look, look how pretty they look. - [Paula] Yes, they do. - [Claudia] See? - [Paula] It's very. appetizing looking Claud. - [Claudia] It's very simple. - [Paula] I don't know how much y'all know about my daughter-in-law, but... - Other than that I'm a. great daughter-in-law, and a great mother and great wife? - Mm-hm other than that,. she is a triathlete. - Well, you're like Bobby, always... - She is a life coach, she is available for. people that need help, and guidance, I mean she's just a wealth wealth of knowledge, about. foods and what they do for you, or what they don't do. for you. (Claudia laughs) So I trust you. I trust you. - So this will. - Feeding my babies.. - Do a lot for you. Oh yes. - Okay, cheers.. (bowls clink) - Cheers. - Bon appetit! (Claudia laughs) - Mm.. - Mm, mm-hm. - It's really good and really. refreshing. It's delicious. - Where did that crunch stuff go? - Ah, see, that's the best part. (laughs) I like the different textures of things. You gotta put in granola. and fruits and stuff. And again you can put whatever you want. (Paula laughs) This is something that. everybody will like. It's good, right? - I feel so healthy! - I'll come feed you,. I'll come feed you too. - You'll come...? - Feed you! - Oh, feed me! (laughs) I wish I could just move in over there and let you tell me what I. can eat and what I can't eat. - Approved by Paula, so. - All right, we got some more recipes that we're gonna do today don't we?
