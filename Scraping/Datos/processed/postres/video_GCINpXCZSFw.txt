- Hey friends. Do y'all sometimes wish, you know, when company drops in and you offer 'em a cup of coffee maybe or something to drink and you think gosh I wish I had something quick I could run in the kitchen. and stir together for 'em. Well this is one of those recipes y'all. You only have to be a. little bit prepared for it. You wanna start by buying some tart shells, you know whatever tart shell you like we're just using a small one because these are called. strawberry tiramisu bites. And so that's considered a bite and they're good,. they're not overly sweet, and I keep them in the freezer. So at a moment's notice I. can stir something together. So I've got my strawberry preserves, and I'm goin' put just a dollop, a little tiny dollop of the preserves in the bottom of our tart shells. Just like that. You wanna come finish. this Theresa so I can- - [Theresa] Yeah.. - [Chef] Go on to the other- Would you mind doing that for me? - [Theresa] Certainly. - I'm gonna come around this. side and I'll do it on top. - [Chef] Okay, there you go. - [Theresa] You can have this.. - [Chef] Thank you. - [Theresa] And I'll take that. - [Chef] It's easy, it. just takes a minute. - [Theresa] No problem. - And plus I get a lick of. strawberry jelly. (laughs) Actually it's strawberry preserves. All right so over here. I've got some lemonade, lemon juice. So these are gonna be nice and lemony. And then I've got mascarpone. cheese which I do love. You like mascarpone? - [Theresa] Mm hm. - [Chef] Okay so we just. gonna mix those together. Tiramisu is one of Michael. Groover's favorite desserts. And do I make it? No, (laughs) I don't. know why I don't make it. Maybe it's 'cause I like my grandmother. Hires' carrot cake better. Or grandma Paul's sour cream pound cake. - [Theresa] Grandgirl's fresh apple. - [Chef] Oh Grandgirl's fresh apple cake. Oh, holy moly. - [Theresa] Apple secrets. - [Chef] Uh huh. I had more fun when I was. filming Paula's best dishes up north we went to an apple orchard and oh my goodness we were,. it was somewhere near... it was somewhere near Gordon's house. - [Theresa] Mm hm I can't remember where. - You just ride into this orchard and red apples as far as you can see it is one of the most beautiful sites. All right. I'm gonna quit talking and. I'm gonna beat this together. Well, is this been turned off? - [Theresa] Probably yeah, I'm sure- - [Chef] The grandkids were over yesterday and they'll come in and hit every button that they can reach. So we just gonna beat this. together till it's creamy. You wanna start out low because that lemon juice and that. lemonade will fly everywhere if we start out too high. What was that Paula? (laughs) Okay that appears to be nice and creamy and incorporated. - [Theresa] Now this is. gonna make a lot more than... - [Chef] Oh my gosh yes. - [Theresa] But since. it's only the three of us. (both laugh) - [Theresa] And we would sit. here and eat all of them. - [Chef] Every one of 'em. All right, so we're gonna come over here. I'm gonna wash these. off and dry 'em though because we're fixing a. whip, heavy cream with them. And I don't want anything to possibly mess up our whipping cream, getting stiff. And I'm sure you know that. all these little hand mixers there's a right hole and a wrong hole for each beater. And it won't work if you trying' to put. it in the wrong hole. Let's see I'm gonna have to open this so, I've got three quarters. of a cup of heavy cream. (cup clatters) And I'm gonna just beat this. (whisk whirring) Until it forms soft peaks. Lemon extract. Powder and sugar. I'm gon' slowly add the powdered sugar because it's starting to get stiff. And I'm gonna add one. teaspoon of vanilla extract. I didn't quite reach the-. oops that's too much. There, that that should. be a full teaspoon. Thank you Teresa. That helps.. - [Theresa] Clean as we go. - [Chef] I'm telling. you that helps so much. That's nice and stiff. - [Theresa] That's so good. - And I'm gonna beat this. doesn't it smell good? (whisk whirring) I'm gonna beat this one more. time to just make sure it's nice and smooth. Hey Mikey! What you doing? - [Mikey] Cleaning up some garages. - [Chef] Oh oh. Is er Michael out there? - [Mikey] He went to. lunch with Miss Michelle. - [Chef] Oh, that's right he told me he was probably gonna go to the Creek house the. Paula Deen creek house. We have really good salads there and Michael's trying to cut back. So he and Michelle, his daughter, are going to lunch there. I had forgotten about that. Now so we're just gonna. fold in our whipping cream into our mascarpone. And when you fold, you go down and back up until everything's incorporated nicely. - [Theresa] Eddie I wanna be. that dog snoring on the floor. - I know it she snores. y'all, Lulu snorers. And sometimes she snores so. loud she wakes me up at night. Can you hear her snoring? - [Theresa] Yes. I'm thinking I would love to. be taking a nap that hard- oh, I just woke her up. - [Chef] Oh only for a second. (chef laughs) You wanna, will your cord reach Eddie? (chef laughs) She's a sleepy head. - [Theresa] Now she is. - [Chef] Uh huh. She can fall asleep so quick. All right I'm gonna need a spoon, another spoon. I love my (chuckles) someone. gave me this teaspoon. No coffee, no talkie. (chuckles) And I know that feeling. All right. So we're gonna bring these over here and we're gon' put a little dollop on each one of 'em. Like so. (bowl scrapes surface) All right. We're gonna finish 'em off. That one's a little thick. They're all a little thick. I'm gonna... These are almost bigger than the tarts. There we go. If you're doing this for. maybe the fourth of July you could add a blueberry have the strawberries and blueberries. (knife clatters) So there you go. Strawberry tiramisu bites. - [Theresa] Pretty. - Aren't they pretty? Happy whatever we're are. celebrating. (laughs) Hm. Come have one! They're good! And they're quick. Bye y'all.
