- Hey, y'all come on in the kitchen. You can tell where my. brain is going, right now. Because I am thinking having three sons that really. love football, baseball, all kinds of sports. So my mind is on things that. they would like for tailgating, or to just mix up for. friends when they come over. Or if you go into somebody else's house, you can make this and give it to them as a little hostess gift. Now I'm going to... In fact, I already have. I've got a "Crispy Corn. & Rice" cereal in here. I put it..I had to find. me a bigger container. I've got a half maybe or. three quarters of a cup of smooth peanut butter.. I like the smooth. - Three quarters of a cup? - Three quarters of a cup. I'm going to put a teaspoon of vanilla, a stick of butter and a 12 ounce package. of semi-sweet chocolates. And I'm just going to put. all this in the micro... I'm not going to put the vanilla yet. I'm going to put all of this. in a microwave-safe bowl. And melt it. So this is, if, for those. that like a sweeter snack, this will be the snack for you honey. And uh, (clattering sounds) I've shared a savory one. with y'all too, today. So you can just pick your poison. What ever you feel like. (clanking sounds) Okay. Does this tell me how long. to microwave it for Theresa? I can't remember. - Till melted. - Okay. I don't, I don't have it on here. Just said melt chocolate. and peanut butter together. Pour over the rice cereal. Yum. So, I can't forget to. add the vanilla to this. So... (glass clanking) I'm gonna put this one. for minute at a time, stirring until it's all melted. Okay y'all, it took me three minutes to melt. all this good together. I did it in one minute increments. And you'll want to make sure. that you stirred this very well until it's completely mixed together. And I just added my vanilla. But see how smooth and creamy that is. It's like delicious. All right. So I'm just going to pour this, I don't know if I can do it. I'm just going to pour. this over my cereal. Like I said this is one. of the sweet snacks. (glass clanking) - Not sure you said how. much the cereal was. - It's one box. (crunching sounds) One box of a regular size cereal. (loud crunching) (giggling) Yeah. What did you call it a crispy. - "Crispy Corn and Rice". - Yeah. Like I said you can use. kind of cereal you want. - Just whatever you think. your children or your husband will eat and like and your friends. (cereal crunching) Alright. I think I'm going to. have to just get in here with my hands in order to get it, (cereal crunching) mixed up real good. And I'm trying to be gentle. So as not to break up the cereal. (cereal crunching) Looks good doesn't it Eddie. (cereal crunching) It don't look like reindeer. dropping so, does it?. (chuckling) Whoa! Mhhhh! Now, if you're a finger licker,. this would be a good one to sit back and enjoy. licking those fingers. An pound of confectionate sugar. I'm going to try to get in here without putting my hands back in it. So, I think this one will do. (crunching) That's uh, semi-sweet chocolate. So, you really, really, really. need this powdered sugar. Because semi-sweet. chocolate is a little bit on the bitter side. (clanking) Okay So I'm doing the powdered. sugar in like third y'all. (light crunching) Like I said, you just want to be careful to try and not to break it up, break up your cereal. (paper rattling) Okay. (light crunching) That's it. (light crunching) When I found this in my handwritten notes, In my recipe drawer. Oops. (loud laughter) Look what I did. This said, "powdered sugar". on it and I didn't know it. but when I found this handwritten recipe in my recipe drawer, it said "puppy chow". I said, Oh great. Cause I've been wanting to. make something for the pups. On uh, my little cooking channel. (ringing) Okay. It's time for our. last snack to come out. Right Theresa that's... - How about I come get. that when you finish. - Yeah, you can come get it. - So there we go. It took, it really did take that one pound of confectionate sugar. to absorb that chocolate. Eddie, dig in baby. - Good stuff It's amazing that the powdered. sugar doesn't go away. I know it. It's good, isn't it? The crispy of the cereal. So like I said, this is a great sweet, tailgating recipe, or just have friends over,. you can put this out. They will enjoy. And I'm probably going to go in here and just break it up a little bit more. You know, you may want some chunks. For people that like to get a bigger bite. But there we go. That's it. That is it for the day. Theresa come taste. And when I say puppy chow now, it's just not for the four legged pups. - Oh no. Definitely not. - This is for the two legged dogs. Speaking of dogs, how are the bull dog doing? - Well, we won last. weekend, but it was a... - Okay - It was having to have a comeback, - You know what, - Over on Saturday. - You know what? I don't care if you win by one point, - I know - You're a winner, right? I'll see Y'all later. Loving best dishes.
