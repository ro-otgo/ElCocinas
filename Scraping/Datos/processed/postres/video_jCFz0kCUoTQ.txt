- Well hey y'all, come on in. How many times have you had. to throw away leftover rice? Well, I'm real bad about hanging onto it and using every bit of it. But a lotta people think, "You know, I'm not gonna use that." Well listen, don't throw it away. Take your leftovers and make rice pudding. It's a very... Excuse me, I gotta take. my gum out my mouth. It's a very retro dessert, y'all. I remember my mama makin' it, with her leftover rice. You know, it's not one. of those most popular desserts, right now. But that's just because. maybe a lot of people hadn't tried a good one. So, I'm gonna share with you a recipe, that between my cousin,. Kelly Ort and myself have kinda put together. Now I have two cups of cooked rice. I started with one cup,. and that's gonna yield two. So, I'm gonna put my rice in there. And I just cooked this in regular water. Now I know some rice pudding recipes, will tell you to cook it in milk, which is fine but I didn't do that, because I'm puttin' something. in this rice pudding that you don't often see,. or if you ever see it. Which is sweetened, Carnation Milk. Sweetened condensed. And I'm gonna take some of this, and beat my egg with it. because this rice is still a tad bit warm, and I don't. want it to cook the egg. So I'm just gonna beat that up, and I'm gonna spoon some. of that warm rice in there. And this is called tempering. You're tempering that. egg, so it can slowly get warm without curdlin' or cookin'. So we're tempering that egg. And that warm rice is gonna. bring it up to temperature. So now I'm just gonna pour. this over the rest of the rice. And, seems like to me y'all, that my mother baked hers off. I'm just almost positive. So, I think I'm gonna do the. same thing with this one. I got out what I call. a small casserole dish, but you know what? I know what I'm gonna do. I know exactly what I'm gonna do. Alright, I'm gonna add. some more condensed milk. It may not, for this amount of rice, it may not take but like 1/2 a can. So really dependin' on how much rice you got. Alright, now I'm gonna add, oh gosh about 1/2 of a 1/2,. 'bout 1/4 cup of raisins. And the raisins really, to. me, just make this recipe. Yummy! Alright, so I'm going to put this in the microwave. and nuke it real quick like, to melt it, and I'm gonna. pour it into our rice pudding. (microwave closing) (buttons beeping) Alright, so I don't know that. I have a bakin' dish, y'all. - [Teresa] How about ramekins? - [Paula] Exactly what. I'm gonna do, Teresa. I'm gonna bake it in my ramekins. (dishes clanking) Oh my goodness, I was lookin', I was looking for those that Good Housekeeping gave me these. I know I have four of 'em. - [Teresa] Do you need me to come look- - [Paula] And this is perfect. But you might help me look (muffled). - [Eddie] There may be. some in the dish pantry. (microwave beeping) - [Paula] Alright here's another one. (dishes clanking) (both women talking in background) - [Teresa] Found 'em! Here we go. - [Paula] Thank ya! - [Teresa] We lost Eddie. - [Paula] Yep. - [Eddie] We took a. tour of the dish pantry. - (laughs) Oh, good! So I found these little cups and they are what, Good Housekeeping gave 'em to me. I was in New York, and I. was doin' the cover I think, to one of their magazines. And they gave me this as a gift. And it's, oh gosh, what is. the bread that you serve with prime rib? - [Teresa] French? - No. It's hollow in the center. My memory's gettin' so bad, y'all. Come on, Eddie, you know what it is. - [Eddie] Something pudding. - Read it off my tongue. (Eddie laughing) You see what I'm thinking? (laughs) - [Eddie] Isn't it something pudding? - Yeah. Yeah, it is. - [Teresa] I know what y'all. are talkin' about, but. - Anyway, (laughs) that's what. you do in these little cups. And i just thank you, Good Housekeeping. After all these years,. I still just love 'em. Just love 'em. So this is gonna be perfect 'cause that would be way too big. Alright, so I'm going to add, I'm gonna add a good bit of vanilla. Let's see.. - [Teresa] Yorkshire pudding. - Yorkshire pudding! That is Yorkshire pudding cups. Thank you, Teresa. - [Teresa] We can thank Google. (laughs) - (laughs) Oh you googled?. You cheated! (laughs) You know, I think, I think we've all kinda gotten lazy. Maybe that's why our memory's so bad, is 'cause we know we got a 'chine that we can turn to, and think for us. Alright, so I melted my butter. So I'm gonna pour that in. And look at this. Now when we bake this, that egg is gonna make it kinda custard-y. And now I'm gonna put in some cinnamon. And I'm usin' my tad, a. smidgen, a drop... (laughs) Let's see, a smidgen, a dash. Come on, Paula, a pinch. But I think I'm gonna use a tad. (laughs) A tad of cinnamon. This is that good cinnamon, right here. Corrie bought this for me. She said, "You got to. use that good cinnamon." - [Eddie] I can smell it. - Huh?. - [Eddie] I can smell it, just a little tad.. - I know it. Alright now, I'm gonna. do that with the nutmeg, 'cause nutmeg is strong, and a little'll go a long way. So that is it. You know what, I think I could use a few more raisins, don't you? Like I said, the raisins. are my favorite part. And you know what else. would be good in it? You wanna guess? - [Eddie] Nuts?|. - Nuts! (laughs) (Eddie laughing) Nuts, and I'm going back. for another tad. (laughs) Alright, let's see if I. can just shake out a tad. Just wasn't quite dark enough to suit me. So you can play around with. different rice recipes. Oh, and let me tell you what I did. I, a lot of times, I never. thought I'd ever say this, but I'm usin' Minute Rice, the kind that you put into boiling water. And I put some butter and some. salt in the boiling water, dropped that instant rice in there. And so I can pull a. meal together like that. So I thought, well today,. I've never made rice pudding usin' a quick rice. So we're gonna try, and I hope it works. Alright, now what was I gonna do? Oh, I know. (laughs) I know, I know. (laughs) Dad gum it! I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take my non-stick (oil spraying) and just do a little bit in the cup. And now I'm gonna fill up each of those cups. See, that's gonna be a perfect. serving size, isn't it? And to me, that looks more appetizing than puttin' it in a. casserole dish, doesn't it? - [Teresa] Mm-hmm. Great way for serving, too. - [Paula] I know! - [Teresa] But you can. only invite four people. - [Paula] I know it, I. wish Good Housekeeping would (laughs) give me four more. (laughs) Water's in the way. - [Eddie] I think that's. about it. I mean-- - [Paula] Yeah, see like I. said, that wouldn't have, that a been so thin. And we want it nice and thick. So we have to dig deep for it. Perfect! Alright, now the last thing I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sprinkle some turinado sugar on it. And turinado sugar, the molasses has been extracted from sugar cane. And then it thickens while it's evaporatin'. It'll get thicker and thicker. And then, they put it in a turbine. They spin it in a turbine. And that's how it got it's. name, turbinado sugar. So it's big-grained sugar. It's the color of brown sugar. But this is wonderful. on top of, like cookies. - [Teresa] Creme brulee.. - [Paula] Creme brulee, yeah. To torch that, it would. be very, very good. So I'm just gonna sprinkle. a little of that on top. Do you think we've got enough? (laughs) - [Teresa] With you, never. - Nev...Oh! Gosh, I almost did it. Made me nervous thinkin' I almost didn't have enough. (laughs) Alright, so I'm gonna put. this in the oven, y'all. Maybe 325, and I'm gonna let it cook until it's thickened and kinda set. And it's gonna be delicious. And it's gonna bring back memories like you never saw. Okay? Maybe 20 minutes? Alright y'all, it's time. to check our rice pudding. (oven door creaks) And let's see what it looks like. Oh my goodness. My goodness, my gracious! Winner, winner, chicken dinner! I think between Kelly and me, we got it. Look at these! Those are just beautiful, y'all. (pudding sizzling) Oh, I'm so proud. Now. what did we do? (laughs) (Eddie laughs) I want y'all to get it straight. Where'd that recipe go? - [Teresa] You always have it. (pudding sizzling) What did we do with it? - [Paula] I don't know. Where'd that little bowl of honey go? - [Teresa] It's right over there. I was tryin' to get it- - [Paula] Oh, okay, yeah. - [Teresa] I don't... - [Paula] Oh, it goes there. What did I do with it, y'all? I wanna make sure that you get exactly, exactly right measurements in this. So anyway, we'll put a link. I'll find it, and we'll put a link and I'll make sure y'all have. the perfect measurements, because this is just incredible lookin'. It's just what I was lookin' for. And it will- - [Eddie] Slide it under there. - [Teresa] Yeah, that's the- - This will take the skin. straight off of your mouth. Doesn't that look delicious? Eddie was just tellin' me that his mama used to make rice pudding a lot. And she would put it in. fancy little goblets. And Eddie would say, "Oh,. Grandma's comin' to dinner. And we're gonna have rice puddin' in the purty glasses." (laughs) - [Teresa] She refrigerated. hers, though, right? - [Eddie] Yes.. - Yes. You can eat this hot or cold. But you know, I'm a kind of a hot girl. (dog barking). - [Teresa] Yes you are. - Alright, what's goin' on? (dog barking and scampering) Who is it? - [Bobby] Bobby.. - Oh, yay! - [Eddie] It's Bobby. - Bobby's come in to help me, y'all. 'Cause I'm gonna be doin'. about six little shows today, so I asked him if he'd come help me. - Come on, you just said you need help, there's so much you don't know? - There so much I don't-. - That's what it is. - Bobby, do you ever remember. me makin' rice pudding? - Oh my, God, yeah. Hi, Teresa. (laughs). - [Teresa] Hey. - Well, I just... - Did you just make some? Did this just come out of the oven? - Oh, it's hot, son, yes. - Smells great. - Mm, taste it. - (laughs) Well, you. just told me it was hot. (Eddie, Teresa laughing) What kinda tricks are you playin', Pearl? Ooh, don't touch it! Taste it. (laughs) - Yeah, taste that, but don't touch that. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm! I might not should've gone back with that other little dash of cinnamon. But it's delicious, y'all. - Mm.. - Isn't that yummy? - So great. - You wanna take that home. to your babies for dessert? - It probably wouldn't. make it to my babies. (Paula and Teresa laughing) But it's so good. It tastes like, it tastes like a my, it tastes like oatmeal to me. - It does!. - It tastes like an oatmeal casserole, a very delicious, delectable, sweet and cinnamon-y oatmeal casserole. That's what my oatmeal tastes like. - It does, it does. - Tastes like you made. a big bowl of oatmeal and baked it in the oven. Hey dogs! - Yes, please speak to 'em. ♪ La la la la, la la la, la ♪ Some people were askin' Eddie about our dogs.. (dogs barking) They hear 'em all of time, but they don't- - I gotta wash my hands.. - Okay. Alright, this is Gus, the big white one. And he, Gus... Come here, Gus! (water running) And Gus is the biggest baby. (laughs) He is the biggest scaredy. cat you've ever seen. Thunder makes him go into pee-pee mode. - [Bobby] Well that's so many dogs. - [Paula] Yes. Max?. - [Bobby] Most dogs. - This is Max. Max is the trouble maker. He goes into my bedroom. If Pumpkin, the cat has slept with me, and the door gets left. open and Max goes in there, he pees on my pillow, tryin' to cover up the scent of Pumpkin. - [Bobby] No secrets here. - [Paula] He's bad, he's just bad. And this is the oldest one in the group, and that's little Lou Lou! Little Lou Lou. And she is so sweet. - [Bobby] Lou Lou is a.... - [Paula] But... But? What do you mean but- - She's an instigator, Bobby. (Bobby laughing) She will get Gus to get riled up, and both. of 'em jump on little Max. And one's eatin' his butt,. and one's eatin' his face. (laughs) And he doesn't. know which way to turn. So, that's- - [Bobby] There you have it. (laughs) - And it's funny. It's like children. They all got a different personality. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Oh! That rice pudding (mumbling) finally cooled off. - Huh? - Finally cooled off. (Bobby speaking gibberish) (Eddie and Bobby laughing) That is some good stuff.. - It is. - [Paula] I am so happy. that I wouldn't give up. - [Bobby] Well, it looks. like I got here just in time. - [Paula] Yeah. - To be a testing dummy.. - Yes. Taste it, dummy.. - Are we gonna cook? - Taste it, dummy.. - I did. - Yeah! (laughs). - It's great. Okay, bye, everybody. - I'm so glad Bobby got here.. - Me, too. - 'Cause I'm gonna put him to work. - Mm, so good!. - Love and best dishes!
