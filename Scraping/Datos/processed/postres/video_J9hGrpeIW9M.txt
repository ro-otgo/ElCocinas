[Music] today is all about holiday cookies and I'm fixing to share with y'all a recipe that makes you look like you're really put in a lot of time and effort on a cookie when you really haven't and I call it hidden mint cookies and the first time I made it for Jamie and Bobby they had a fit over him and they said mama this is just one of the best cookies how did you get that stuff in the center and I said well guys y'all won't believe just how simple this cookie is now this is just a regular sugar cookie dough that you get in your dairy case at the grocery store and we're gonna slice these real thin and you'll want to make sure that you put these a good ways apart on your sheet because these are gonna rise and we're cutting those gosh probably about 1/4 of an inch thick now on this cookie dough I'm gonna lay a chocolate wafer cookie and you can find these in your grocery store too or if you've got some some of those chocolate Girl Scout cookies maybe in the freezer you can use those and they'll be delicious now we're just gonna lay a cookie on top of our dough just like that and then we're going to come back in here and put another slice of dough on top of it now you could put anything in the inside of this cookie you know all the little bite-sized candy bars you could put one of those in there now I've gotten an egg just one whole egg and I've beaten it up and I'm just gonna brush those because now we're fixing to put some chopped pecans on top of these and that egg will just help the pecans stick and you could use any kind of nut so now we're gonna put this cookie in a preheated 375 degree oven and we're gonna let it cook for about ten minutes all right let's get that in the oven now cookies are ready Oh YUM and see how I told you they were gonna spread these are big cookies so we're gonna let these cool a minute look at that surprise Center but no one would ever guess that this was a refrigerated dough bought from your grocery store Gerty come on and I'll give you a cookie come here you ready for your cookie [Music]
