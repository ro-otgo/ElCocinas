- We're chugging right along, y'all, with our 12 days of Christmas cookies. It seems like we've spent 24 days making these cookies, Eddie. (Eddie chuckles) Now how many does this make? - [Eddie] Right now we're. only on recipe number five. - No! No, no. - [Eddie] We did three already. - We had five. We did three, and then we did two. And then we did, I think. this will be number eight. I think. If I'm correct. So we getting' close.. - [Eddie] Did we really? We did five already?. - Uh huh. - [Eddie] With Teresa? Oh. - Yeah, I remember when Theresa left. 'cause we said, "Gosh, we got five of some wonderful cookie recipes that have been sent in by. our friends out there." And this next cookie sounds wonderful. It's Godiva chocolate, sea. salt, and hazelnut cookies. That's a mouthful. And it sounds good. Well, we could not find the Godiva chocolate. anywhere in this town. But, Casey found Ghirardelli. And then Lindt chocolate. So I don't think it'll make. all that much difference. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. I don't know. But this recipe was sent. in by Pamela Hudson. And she sent me a picture. I love it. (chuckles) She sent me a picture of one of their cookie swaps. And she said they have the best time. Let me see. Look. (chuckles) One of them is wearing a beard. Beard on a stick. One's wearing a bow tie. One of them is chewing on some butter. (Paula chuckles) And these two are just. having fun watching them. (amused giggle) All right. So let's see. "Every year my parents would. host numerous holidays. Open houses starting from. Thanksgiving to Christmas and it made the holidays. pure magic for me. We would start preparations. around Halloween with making dough and freezing. So baking of the magical. cookies would be easier. My mother would also host an annual cookie exchange. party for friends. A tradition I've carried on when I can. Here are a few favorites of mom and mine. Can't wait to watch. when you do the airing." So, thank you, Pamela. But, you know she said, "These are a few of my mama's favorites." But I only got one recipe, Pamela. So, I don't know, 'cause. to me a few is three. So, I would hate if you sent. them, and I had misplaced them. So, that's the only. recipe I can find, Pamela, from you and your mother. But it sounds like a heavenly one. So, let's go ahead and get started. By melting a stick of butter. And Pamela said, "Don't let it spit." (soft chuckle) "Don't let your butter spit." I guess, by that she means,. don't let your butter spit. (giggles softy). (paper crinkles gently) So I won't let it spit. And when that melts, we are. gonna add our dark brown sugar. Our white sugar. It calls for castor sugar, which is a a finer sugar. than, you know, what we use. But we're just using. regular sugar, Pamela. So, hope that doesn't mess anything up. And then, we're gonna fold in our flour and we're gonna let that cool. And then, we're gonna add. our chocolate and our eggs. Our baking powder, our. soda, and hazelnuts. And does this not call. for any kind of extracts? It doesn't, does it? Okay, Pamela, you can see. our butter's not spitting but it's melted through and through. So I'm gonna add our dark brown sugar, our white sugar, castor sugar, if you have it. (spoons clang loudly) And we're gonna stir that together. And we did take that off the heat. I cut off the flame. (gritty scrapes) That looks good already.. (chuckles lightheartedly) Just the brown sugar.. - [Eddie] Brown sugar? Sure. - Uh-huh, and the dark brown sugar? Yes, looks wonderful. All right. So, now I'm gonna add our flour. And then we're gonna set it to the side and let it. cool for about 10 minutes. And then we'll add our. egg and our chocolate. While this is cooling,. I'm gonna do a rough chop on our chocolate. (soft metallic scrapes) (gentle taps) I truly cannot tell y'all how. much pleasure it brings me to hear from y'all and. receive your recipes. And I just thank you for. sharing with all of us. And helping you keep your memories alive. Now, a rough chop.. (tender crackle) You know, people's rough. chop could be interpreted many different ways. (chocolate clatters) (robust snaps) Snap, snap! (snaps continue) Okay. (chocolate clatters softly) Oops! Is it a flyaway, Eddie? - [Eddie] Uh-huh. (soft metallic clang) (sharp snaps). (jewelry jingles mildly) (glass clinks sharply) - [Eddie] This could be a. chocolatey cookie, here. - [Paula] Huh?. - [Eddie] Look at all that chocolate. - [Paula] These are gonna. be some chocolate cookies. (metallic clang) (wooden scratches). Okay. All right. Our next step is to toast off our hazelnuts. And I put just a little. pat of butter in there. And it won't take long to toast your nuts. In fact, any kind of nuts. that you're roasting, they can burn very quickly. So you'll wanna stand there and be stirring them the. whole time, constantly. Lest you burn your nuts. So, we don't want that to happen. (soft metallic clatter) So, I'm gonna kind of,. turn that heat down some. And like I said, I'm gonna. kind of, stand right here with them and watch them. And then I'm gonna come over here and see if this is cool enough. And I think that it is. (loud scratching sound) I think that it's cool enough. Look that, y'all. Looks pretty good, doesn't it? (Paula giggles gently) All right. So, we're gonna add one egg. Our soda. (glass bowls clink loudly) Our baking powder. Now I'm just gonna go ahead and mix that all together. So we won't have any trouble. (loud clinks and grinds) (glass rasps wetly). mixing it into our dough. Okay. So here we go. (glass bowl clatters) And like I said, that's. a real thick batter. (machine whirring in the background) (batter crunches softly) I can't wait to taste these! (spoon taps loudly). All right. By roasting and toasting a nut, it helps bring out the flavor. It makes so much difference. It just makes that nut come alive. (pan clangs softly) Okay, I think that's enough. So I'm gonna go ahead and. add this to our dough. And Casey's preheating our oven, and we're gonna get these in the oven. And we're gonna be eating a. fancy cookie 'fore too long. Okay, our cookies are. going in the oven at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes. Which is kind of the average. bake time for cookies. These look incredible! Who's hiding around that corner? Oh hi, darling! (laughs jovially) My cousin and his wife just have come up. And I'm gonna put Don to work. Don's a great cook. But anyway, Pamela, I. cooked these for 10 minutes. And I left the other tray in the oven for about two more minutes. But I know your instructions said you know, done, but a soft center. And these smell divine. So I'm gonna leave them. on the tray to cool for five minutes. And then I'm gonna try one. Pamela Hudson. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us. They look divine. They look like a wonderful, uppity? I don't wanna say uppity. But it looks like- - [Eddie] A little gourmet cookie. - Yeah, a little gourmet cookie. Like, maybe the ingredients. would kind of costly. (Paula and Casey chuckle) - [Eddie] Well, Godiva chocolate. - Yeah, Godiva. And Casey couldn't find it. Thank you so much. And I'm just so nosy. to know what you meant by "A few recipes." 'Cause I only got one. - [Eddie] Theresa might. be holding out on us. - Am I being greedy now? Where's the other ones?. (giggles softly) (chews delicately) If you like chocolate, y'all have to open up the link to this and get the exact measurements because it's a wonderful chocolate cookie. And thank you so much for sharing. And Pamela said in her little note, "Oh I hope you choose mine to make I can't hardly wait to. see if you pick mine." (chuckles) We picked yours. Mmm. Mmm.
