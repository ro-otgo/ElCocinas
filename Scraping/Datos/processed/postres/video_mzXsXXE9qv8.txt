- Hey y'all! Here in the Dean family camp, we are celebrating with a. recipe that is so deserving, because it's father's day. And it's also the first day of summer. So, you know, there's just. nothing like good old ice pops cold fruit pops to give to the children. You know, they actually kinda healthy. Yeah. They healthy compared. to some things aren't they? [Camera Man] (LAUHGING). Like chocolate cake, or? - But we're doing this,. in honor of our fathers. Because we want you to. have a real cool day. And these are for the kiddies, because we want them to. have a good, cool day too. And that'll allow you. to have a cool day too. So I'm gonna take our raspberries, beautiful, beautiful raspberries, Theresa. - [Theresa] Thank you. All right. And we're going to puree these. until they are really, puree. You know, raspberries have. a lot of little seeds. And so the recipe and gosh I've had this recipe so many years. Y'all in fact, I've made this before for some of my grandchildren. and they love that ice cream. (sink running) So this is a wonderful way. to give them what they want without you worrying about so much sugar. But now this does have sugar in it though. I don't want to mislead you. All right. So, and go, oh, I better get. a bowl, better get a bowl Cause I'm fixing to throw the. pop away and keep the scenes. (LAUGHING) which would be so Paula-ish. So, what I'm going to do now. Oh my goodness. Look at that beautiful fruit y'all. What I'm going to do is. I'm going to encourage, the juice to come out of there. Therese could you pass. me a spatular please? - [Therese] Sure. - [Paula] That rubber one. it says, "butter y'all". - [Theresa] Can't think. about what a spatula was. - Well my definition and yours are probably two different things, so. Now to me If our making this. for my older grandchildren, I wouldn't bother separating the seeds. I would give them to them. just like this is pureed out. But since it's gonna be. all kind of little ones licking on these I am. gonna remove the seeds. And I'm going to do that. by stirring and mashing stirring and matching. mashing, not matching. It's coming. So I got every bit of the goody out of it. That is just the seeds y'all. And it's still seeping through there. Oh my goodness it smells heavenly So there is our seedless, raspberry juice. All right. Now I'm gonna add some yogurt. Stir that in. And I'm going to add some lime. juice, got a little tartness And then I'm going to add,. turbinado simple syrup. Now this is two thirds a cup of turbinado sugar and. two thirds, a cup of water. And you just put that on the. heat until that sugar dissolves - [Theresa] Then that one. actually they ain't tell you Paula they'd like you to cool it. - Yeah. - [Theresa] And it has. to be made a little bit. - [Paula] Yes. The reason. it's already been done is because it has to sit, but. at least an hour to coupe. So Theresa did go ahead. and do that part earlier which I appreciate. This looks delicious. I can see little pieces of the yogurt. I know Cloud, you know, with. me living right next door in Bobby's guest's house, I. can see a lot of things that go on and see their routine. and what Cloud gives them. I mean, I got a front. row seat on watching this and I know she him yogurt. every day of their life but they have never tasted milk. She will not give them milk. I don't know the reason. I don't know the reason. And I certainly don't question it but for some reason they get their dairy through cheese and yogurt. All right. I'm going to use my handy dandy little, - [Theresa] What would. you do without that? - I don't know. And listen, it's so old. Theresa, it's getting. - [Theresa] Might have to glue it? Oh my gosh. I can't, I can't stand. the thoughts of something happening to do this thing. I bought it at an antique shop somewhere. I say antique I'm sure it was a junk shop. Cause that was all I did for years and years and years. and years was junk shops. So for some reason, I just. love digging for my treasures. I just left it. - [Theresa] I think a lot of people do. It's the find. - Yeah. - [Theresa] It's the thrill of the hunt. - Yes. The hunt, the hunt. It's all about the hunt. I think I'm going to use my. whisk because I'm seeing pieces of yogurt. And how would it be. happier if it was blended. Better a little bit better. Theresa, where in the. world did you get this. - [Theresa] Amazon. - Look. - [Theresa] My favorite place. - I mean this is so stinking cute. It even comes with a. little, your little funnel. - [Theresa] Yeah. So you don't make a big. mess, but I tell you what old Paula, I'll find a way to. make a mess, I can promise. Whoa! - [Theresa] And there we have it. - See (LAUGHING) what did I tell you. - [Theresa] Now I read a little tip. - [Paula] Yes, well share it with us. - [Theresa] The little recipe. book that came with it. They say you should let these. freeze for an hour and then put your sticks in. - [Paula] That's right, if. you're using a small paper cup that's exactly what you would do. - [Theresa] And then were. gonna freeze them overnight and when we shoot tomorrow. Paula your gonna get to bring them back out again. - [Paula] Yes. So, but. here's the deal y'all. This ice pop get up, has. the lid with holes in it. So you don't have to freeze. them until they're semi-frozen. You just send them through those. slits and it holds them up. I love it. You know, it's the little things. that can make me so happy. I just love this trick. that Theresa got on Amazon. Look, that's got a little. cover and all you do. Let's see, I got, I got two, four, six. What is it? 10. I got nine. I think let's go ahead, peek. Okay. Yeah. And see, by using this little. contraption, you don't have to wait until it's half frozen. because this little top keep some standing up right in the center. I love it. And this is probably going. to take a few hours to to freeze. Theresa did a good day's work when she - [Theresa] (LAUGHING) It was so hard. - [Paula] found this well, when. you found that when you did a good day's work sister. Alright now, I'll put these on our tray because our freezer is outside. So I don't want to trip (LAUGHS) or I don't want to drop this. In fact, I think I'm going. to pass it on to Theresa. She's younger and more surefooted than me. (LAUGHING) Okay. It would be good if I. had set these out a few minutes but I walked straight from. the freezer into the counter. So they'd be a lot easier to get out. If you let them fall for a second. There we go. This looks like a professional. fruit pop doesn't it. - [Camera Man] Mm. - Here we go. - [Theresa] Made by you. - Made by us. It's so tart. So refreshing, very. strong raspberry taste. So if you're not a fan of raspberries you could use any fruit you want. - [Theresa] Blueberries, strawberries. Yeah, blueberries would. be so good or strawberries - [Theresa] Paula questions for you because we put lime juice in there. Would you still keep it as. long juice with any fruit - Yeah, or lemon. - [Theresa] Okay. I didn't. know if there was a, a rule. - Yeah. Just to give it that little tart, that little tart flavor. Would you Like a bottle of my yogurt pop? - [Theresa] I'll take it from you. So never gets upset from the backend. - Oh. - [Theresa] I know. - We're all clean we've spent. so much time with each other. What do you think? - [Theresa] These are so good. I mean - [Paula] you like it? - [Theresa] I was scared based. on your face was I was like. - It was tart. - [Theresa] It's got a good tart to it. - [Paula] Uh huh. Good tart. - [Theresa] It's creamy. - All right Eddie, you can. take a bite right there. (LAUGHING) - [Theresa] Yeah that drives him nuts. - Eddie is so nice nasty. Mm. - [Theresa] That might be a. little too tart for the babies unless they really. - It might be, but they eat - [Paula] So much fruit. I mean they love raspberries. - [Theresa] Do they like lemons? - Mm. - [Theresa] Then they'll be fine then. - [Eddie] And pickles, Olivia was chucking. - Oh they'll be fine - [Theresa] they'll be better than us. - Mm. Oliva is like a fruit. eater you have ever met. I mean, she is. So I'm going to put these back. in the freezer unless y'all want on does anybody here want one? - [Theresa] Not right now. - Y'all want one? You got to do this and you got to get this little contraption from Amazon. - [Theresa] I'm surprised. you finally used it. - I know. - [Theresa] Now I know how to use it. - I know, it's just great. And I know this has got to be better for us than like. - [Theresa] well it's. natural, it's all natural, I mean even if it though. it has some sugar in it. - Yeah. Mm, It's good y'all gotta try it. Perfect for the summer. - [Theresa] Mm. - You can put that back in the freezer. - I sure am. - Thank you, Thank you. And the colors are pretty. Bye y'all I'm going to eat my yogurt pop.
