- Hey y'all, we're still as busy as a cat covering up his stuff. So Miss Theresa selected the. recipe for this video today, and it sounds really good. And the person that. sent it sounds so cute. Doesn't she Theresa? - [Theresa] She does. She had. me at cherry and chocolate. - Uh huh. She was so in love with cherry. She said, well, this is what she says, One day, years ago, I couldn't decide if I wanted to bake a chocolate pie or a cherry pie. Because I loved them both. Well, I decided to combine. them and this is what I did. And it is now our family favorite. - [Theresa] It's about to. be my family favorite too. (laughing) - And this comes from Dawn Wilkson, Pleasant View, Tennessee. Thank you, Dawn. Thank you so much. And can I say what her name is on the, - [Theresa] I love that,. you have to say it. - Her, what do you call it? - [Theresa] Well don't say. the thing, just tell her what is says from. Who's it. say it's from? Sassy something? No, up at the top. - Sassy Banjo. - [Theresa] Yeah, don't say. anything else after that, but just say sassy. - Sassy Banjo is her name. - [Theresa] Yeah, that's. what she uses as her, - I love it! - [Theresa] That's her email. - I wish you were here Dawn. Theresa is nuts for both. cherries and chocolate. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm - So you had made her a happy, happy girl. - [Theresa] You like. cherry and chocolates too. - Oh, heck yeah. Chocolate covered cherry, honey! Get me that little box. - [Theresa] And add pie crust to it? - Yeah! - [Theresa] What more could you want? - Yeah! Alright. So this is very, very. simple, what Dawn does. So you have two unbaked pie crust. And Dawn says I make my own, but my sons use the. Pillsbury refrigerated crust. Listen, I'm with your sons, Dawn. Let's not stress if we don't have to. Alright, we've got two 10 ounce. cans of cherry pie filling. That we're going to put in our bowl. These lids are so dangerous, y'all. - [Theresa] Sorry, I meant to, - [Paula] You have to be careful. - [Theresa] I meant to pop it, but I wanted it covered until you got it. - [Paula] So careful, because it's like, it's just like a razor blade. There we go! Mmm, Mmm,Mmm! I'm happy already! Happy, happy. (giggling) Okay. So we are going to put this in our bowl. You know what? This weekend y'all I made, we had a delayed birthday. dinner for my baby, Jack. - [Theresa] Who's not a baby. (laughing) - He'll always be my baby. (laughing) Ya know? He just turned 15, last month, and it was so many things going on. We, I didn't get to make. him his birthday meal. So he asked if I would. make it this past Saturday. So I did, and I'm telling you what, I couldn't have gotten that. meal together without Jack. He wound up making the biscuits, making the squash casserole. What else did he make? He cut up all the squash, he just did so much. And it was wonderful being in there with my oldest grandson who's so smart. So helpful. So kind. So courteous. So everything that I'd. want to be when I grow up. (laughing) - [Theresa] Exactly. - So, - [Theresa] that's a good resume. - Yes. So anyway, what I was getting to, is I made fresh apple fried pies for him. Apples are his favorite, and it was some kind of good. You didn't eat one did you, Eddie? - [Eddie] No, I didn't, actually, no. It seemed like they were. going out pretty quick. I know people kept looking for 'em. (laughing) - Everything went so quick. In the middle of the meal, I had to stop and cook another pot of rice. And I needed to make. another batch of biscuits, but I didn't do it. So everybody just had no. choice but quit eating. And you know, Eddie, I could. so tell that it's been a long, long time since, - [Eddie] It's been a full year. - They mama, mama's cooking. Yeah, it's been a full year. (cellophane crinkling) Oh, our scissors need replacing so bad. So, Dawn tells us to put your pie crust on the bottom, of your plate. And I have to tell you Dawn, to me, well, I, I can, I can stand a frozen pie shell in the tin. You know to me they're. not all that bad, but, this, to me, is much, much better than, than the one. Alright, I got to get. this centered just right. Okay. So now you can kind of do your, your edges any way you want to. You can kind of do them like that, or you can get a fork and. you can just fork 'em. Whatever you want to do. Whatever makes you happy. Kind of lay that back like that. - [Theresa] Do you, is. there a way to do it, Paula? Because, since you're going. to be putting a top on it too. - [Paula] Uh huh - [Theresa] Oh, is there a difference in how you fold 'em or no? - [Paula] I don't know. Theresa,. you know, it has been very, very long since I've made a two crust pie. I mean, it's been years. - [Theresa] I like that even. more that it's two crusts. - [Paula] Uh Huh (laughing) Yes. Oh, I messed, I messed up on that when you got me tickled. and jerked him around. Okay. So there we go. Now she said, put the fruit. filling and the chocolate chips in a bowl and stir. We've done that. Pour into pie crust and. top with second crust. Top with milk and sprinkle. it with some sugar, because we'll want it shiny. This is gonna be insanely delicious. - [Theresa] I know. - You know that. - [Theresa] Yes! - So anyway, I was thinking that I need to get some cherries and make this in the fried pie form. - [Theresa] Mmm, I didn't. even think about that - Uh huh, Uh huh. And you know what?. Eddie, they went so fast. The next night I still. had my fresh apples. I had put Fruit Fresh on them so they, they didn't turn brown on me. So, I made another batch. I got 10 more pies done out. of the rest of that fruit. Look at this. Now how pretty is that? That is so pretty Dawn. Sassy Banjo girl. Alright. (cellophane crinkling) So we're going to put. this other pie crust on. And, she doesn't have any recommendations. She said just put the pie crust on top of your cherries. This is some pretty dough. - [Theresa] Thank you, I made it myself. (laughing) - [Paula] Well, you did a lovely job. Alright. So, this is what I'm gonna do. I think I'm gonna do. - [Theresa] what does she say we need to, - [Paula] Milk, - [Theresa] Wash it with? - [Paula] Milk, or we can do an egg wash. - [Theresa] What would you prefer? - [Paula] Uh, - [Theresa] I have no eggs I have none. - You know, let's just do the milk. Like she recommends. How about that? You know how I feel, always follow the recipe. just right the first time. This is very pretty. And I love having that top crust because now it's double and. you've got enough to work with. You know? You got enough to pinch. And how simple. Hey, Gus Buster. Hey, Gussy Gus. - [Theresa] I haven't. seen Gus in a long time. - [Paula] I know! Gus has been staying with Eddie while I was in Bobby's house. His condo. I mean his guest house. So look how beautiful that looks. Is that not a beauty? - [Eddie] That's a deep crust there. - [Paula] That is a beauty, Dawn. Alright, now I'm gonna take. What you want Gus Buster? Say, "Give me some pie. Give me some pie mama." (giggling) He hadn't had a treat yet, has he? - [Eddie] Uh, no. - Okay. Well I'm gonna. give that boy a treat. Oh, a treat! Oh! Here comes Lulu. Everybody wants a treat. E'ery-body. Okay. So I'm just going. to brush this with milk. And I wonder if I should put the torinabo, Tur-bi-nado sugar, - [Theresa] I say yes. - [Paula] instead of regular. - [Theresa] I say yes. - [Paula] Okay. You talked me into it Theresa - [Theresa] It was real hard. I even bought of box of this for my house. - [Paula] You did? - [Theresa] Mm hmm, I haven't it used yet, but this could be, this could be my breaking out party. - [Paula] Well, you should. have just borrowed mine. - [Theresa] Yeah, it lasts. a long time, doesn't it? - [Paula] Yes. I would have been happy. to share a box with you. Alright, now I'm gonna to vent this. She didn't say to but, I'm gonna vent it. Like so. I have to get that in my right hand. I have to do it right-handed. Maybe I can. Oh, Oh, Oh! I think we have got us. a new favorite dessert. Wouldn't this be beautiful at Christmas? - [Theresa] Yes - [Paula] Okay. If you love it as much as my family does, I hope you share it. with your channel, also. And I love it. I love. sharing y'alls recipes. I love, love hearing what y'all do. So Dawn said that she cooks her, bakes hers at 475 degrees for 40 minutes. - [Theresa] We said, - Now that sounds a little high for me. - [Theresa] I think that. four might have gotten - Okay, so let me just fix. this one piece on that crust. When you picked it up, I could see it. Uh huh. I could see the sides. I hope I got the top - [Theresa] It looks beautiful. - Mm hmm. I hope the top is stuck to the bottom. You know? - [Theresa] Mm hmm - I might should've. dampened it with water. Ooh hoo hoo, it's just poi-ty, Poi-ty, poi-ty, poi-ty. (laughing) - [Theresa] Is that good? - Okay! See ya'll in 40 minutes. Thank you, Dawn. Thank you, Sassy banjo! Who wants a treat?! (laughing) Oh, look it. Gus you haven't had one of these, you hadn't had this treat. Lulu adores this treat right here. She adores it. And she's gonna share with you, Gussy! (laughing) Well, look at that. How do you like that bacon? That looks good enough to eat. Alright, sit! Oh, you precious angel. Oh, do you want this? Is this what you want? That's what I want mama! (laughing) She loves those. Look at Gus, he's already. gotten in his bed, now. Chewing on his treat. Okie doke, Theresa! - [Theresa] I've been waiting for this. - [Paula] Dawn, you have. made Teresa so excited. Honey, I can't tell you. how happy this girl is. Her two favorite things. in the whole world, besides Keith, alright. - [Theresa] Exactly, (Paula laughing) thank you for covering me on that one. - [Paula] You know what I think I like, this little piece right here. Mmmm. That milk and that turbinado sugar and you, y'all know, I've showed you my little trick about cutting through the tin foil. - [Theresa] I know this is the real deal. I can't cut through this glass pie plate. Hopefully. Thank you, Eddie. - [Theresa] He's been a. nervous wreck about this pie not coming out the. pan, and look at that. - [Paula] Well, it's still kind of, (Paula laughing) - [Theresa] It's still kind of what? - [Paula] You want some Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes. - [Paula] It's still kind of warm. - [Theresa] I still want. Yes, I've been waiting for you. to cut it for like 3 hours. - Well come over here. and pick up your fork. I ain't partin' with this pie. - [Theresa] I mean, 3 hours I've waited. - I know it, dig in sister. You take the first bite. - I just wanna (laughing) - What you say? - That is good. - And you know, it's still, - It's just like chocolate cherry. - It's still warm. - Oh, You know. I like it like that. It's a good blend of chocolate. Wow. It's so easy. - It was so, - [Theresa] I mean, especially since we didn't make the crust, do you know what I mean? Like the crust would be the. hardest thing to make on this. If you made the crust by hand. - There you go, sister. - Gosh, double crust. (laughing) - I mean what more could you want in life? - Mm hmm Alright. I didn't cut that too clean. I left some of the bottom crust on, so I'm trying to pull it out. And I'll give you the. other part of your crust. - [Eddie] I'm curious as. to the stacks of butter that you have beside it. Is that for something? Or? - [Theresa] Oh, I thought. she was gonna slap it on, at one point. - That would be good, wouldn't it? No, I had just been using. the butter for somethin' - [Theresa] It doesn't need it. - And it just stayed there. Not one teaspoon of butter in this pie. Dawn, I've got to figure out how to get a teaspoon. of butter in that pie. (laughing) - [Theresa] Could you have. used butter on the top instead of. - [Paula] Milk? (laughing) - [Theresa] Yeah, I mean. like could you. Like. I mean, would that help it. or does that ruin the pie? - Oh no. Uh uh. This is. fine, just like this. Thank you Dawn. Made our day. Chocolate covered cherries. Look how beautiful. Look how beautiful.
