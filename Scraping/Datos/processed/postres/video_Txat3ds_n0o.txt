hey y'all i got a lot going on in my kitchen today because uh we actually cooked do multiple cooking videos in the same day so i got vegetable soup over here i got grand girls apple cake in the oven but i am fixing to share with y'all a recipe that was shared with me from a lady that lives right out here near us her name is margaret federal and uh she said i don't know if you're still accepting recipes paula but here's mine and it's called a sherry nutmeg nutmeg cake and she said it's one of those delicious recipes that if you're in a pinch you can do it quick so thank you so much margaret uh i just loved hearing from you and so glad that you're enjoying the videos uh in fact let's see and the recipe came to my i watched your video of jamie's chicken salad so i appreciated hearing the story of how it all happened for you and your business your story is so encouraging paula you should write a book truly okay so i did margaret like 18 of them and they said i couldn't even read a book in high school i showed them didn't all right so here is margaret's federal cake it's one box of cake mix without the pudding added one box of instant vanilla pudding half a teaspoon of nutmeg four whole eggs three-fourths of a cup of sherry and this is a dry sherry it's definitely not a cooking sherry it's it's the real deal and it's not a cream cherry so and three four three i can't talk with my new teeth three-fourths a cup of cooking of uh like mozilla on a vegetable oil so uh according to margaret you just dump everything in a bowl and mix it and then put it into um a greased plant pan and margaret um goes on to tell me look at my pretty eggs our little chickens they hatch them so quick and we have to put the date on them that we collected them so that we know to use the oldest ones first but you know i was told when i started uh with chickens that eggs were safe on your counter up to 30 days but i still throw them in the fridge okay in goes our nutmeg let's go ahead and put our instant vanilla pudding in there and um you know i told y'all in earlier videos if you see all in a cake you know it's gonna be good so there goes our three-fourths cup of all and we're just gonna mix this up oh thank you i've got stuff in your way all right i think i might use the little a little whisk oh i can smell it hush hush we lost another leaf baby out there on a tree maybe two you know i was reading some of the comments um and i think we brought up the egg thing before a lot of your your farm farm bring in friends uh that you know they mentioned that yes that's right you know up to 30 days without washing the egg if once you wash the egg then it has to be refrigerated so if you take it right out of the hen house i'm so glad to know that because uh i didn't wash mine i just put them in a bowl and uh kept them up on my counter but we wash ours over yeah when summer came though i started putting them in the refrigerator and i don't i still don't wash them you know it's got a little chicken poo on it that's all right a little chicken poo never hurt anybody of course when i go to use it i do wash it off but that's nature's nature's way of taking care of that egg all right so i added our 3 4 cup of sherry and it is strong smelling y'all okay it smells good it's a little mike yeah that's what the dogs were barking at great you do your vision's better than mine this can is about to run out idiom and it's hard for me to see if i'm getting it coated real good but i think i did didn't i might have got it over coated overcoat get it overcoated all right so margaret said that uh one time i think her husband was in the service of some form and she said um a few years ago when we stationed in germany hush i wanted to create a more elegant presentation that i could serve to a senior officer and his wife who came to our place for dinner out of the blue i decided to look they just opened the door and went out by themselves go get that squirrel they saw mike out there and they adore mike not my mic but another mic all right let's see i decided to serve it with a mix of raspberries and blueberries topped with a dollop of uh let's see with the dolphin topping made with light brown sugar and a full fat sour cream a recipe i got from my mother-in-law i can't tell you the ratio to sugar to sour cream since i often don't measure when i cook but to my surprise the combination of the fruit and cake together takes it to a whole other level so thank you margaret oh it's teresa coming back all right so this is ready we're going to dump it in our bundt pan and we're going to cook it for come on in to reece we're going to cook it for 45 minutes did you find everybody who's looking for gus well that's you she i think i you know kind of got confused a little bit because uh she was driving your car oh yes we treat you teresa had run an errand and her car is in the shop so she used mine and i swear gus can hear he can hear that car when it comes up to the gate okey doke we've had fun theresa you miss me yes and we've started the vegetable soup we've got the uh grand girls apple cake in the oven what is that right there wow oh wait i bet it's that nutmeg and now you're making the sherry and now i'm making margaret federal's uh sherry cake yeah and i know it sounds good and it's easy easy easy which is right up my alley so we're gonna put this in the oven bake it for 45 minutes look i was worried about not getting the grease enough the grease is laying on okay 45 minutes okay margaret here we go your sherry nutmeg cake voila oh it's nice and brown isn't it you know i don't think i've ever baked a cake in that oven but i see what you mean margaret about wanting to fancy this up a little bit and it would be so so so easy to do but as i told y'all what uh margaret does she mixes sour cream and sugar which you can put sugar in just about anything it's gonna make it good yeah i decided to serve it with a mix of raspberries and blueberries topped with a dollop of topping made with light brown sugar and full fat sour cream i can't tell you the ratio of sugar to sour cream since i don't often measure but you know what we can just taste that alone and get it to just the sweetness that you want so margaret i thank you so much your letter meant so much to me um just knowing that one of my neighbors is tuning in on youtube and i thank you
