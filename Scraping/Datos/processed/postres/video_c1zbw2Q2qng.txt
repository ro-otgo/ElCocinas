need to talk after this believe me no talking after this only now i have to say something yeah we need to talk oh [Laughter] see i told you girls that's how you get them out of your hair okay so instead of talking teach me how to make this little secret that you promised me before i knew i could get him away from that pizza i'm still dreaming from the last time i came to your restaurant i had a piece of pie of this pecan pie and from grandpa pecan pie and from that day on the only sweet dream that i have is about this pecan pie so you promise you teach me this so i'm gonna teach you how to make this pie it's so easy all right i'm going to get us out of bowl and what i want you to do is beat up these three eggs for me okay no problem this ain't know how to do and just beat them up for me okay now we're starting with uh a refrigerated pie shell that we have just put and pressed and fluted into our pie plate now i'm gonna start adding about two cups of pecans now some people like their pecan halves whole some people like them chopped up they say they that the pie piece is cut better i want to make the same pie that you make in your restaurant okay i'm using halves here today okay all right so i'm gonna put about two cups now this is the way we do it at the restaurant and this way we know that we've got just the right amount of pecans you see how i've covered the bottom of that shell mm-hmm i've got some melted butter over there if you would pass me that butter please max and should i pour it into it just pour it on it you cannot mess up this pie pecan pie i promise you cannot mess it up all right now i've got my measuring cup because we're gonna measure out a dark corn syrup and that syrup is gonna make almost like a custard do you remember when you cut into that pie and it was kind of like a dark almost custardy like this is exactly the thing i dream of every night yes how much should i cook half a cup of dark syrup wow this is so beautiful now the reason we sprayed our cup is cause you know how sticky syrup is and look it's yeah pour it on in so see the way that syrup just slips away from our dish and it's so beautiful yes it's so beautiful and we're not gonna lose a drop of it all right now we're gonna add one cup of sugar and you can just be whisking all this together for us we don't even need a mixer for this pie and lots of times down here in the south we love adding chocolate to our pecan pies so in your honor today yes in your honor we're gonna add about four ounces of chocolate all right well let's get some of our chocolate and like i said we're going to use about four ounces and you can just kind of just for me now we're gonna add one other ingredient that folks in the south have a kind of taste for the secret ingredient yeah which is a little bourbon so i'm gonna do like two tablespoons of bourbon everything in the world tastes so much better if you add some chocolate into it well absolutely i don't know anything that chocolate can't help now all we're gonna do at this point is pour our pie filling over those nuts wow oh my god those pecans are gonna rise to the top and we're gonna see every one of them in there all right so we're going to bake this y'all we're going to put it in a preheated oven that's been heated to 375 degrees we're going to bake it for 10 minutes then we're going to lower the temperature to 350 and
