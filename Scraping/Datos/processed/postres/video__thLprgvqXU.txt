[Music] [Music] okay welcome back y'all it's time for me to move on to a Michaels favorite part of the meal which is the sweets and you know when we go into Mexican restaurants it seems like that we fill up so on on all the food that we never want to dessert so I don't think of desserts as being a big part of Mexican menus but the next thing I'm gonna make is shoe rows they're much like a hot donut or a beignet now I've melted a half a stick of butter and I'm gonna pour in a cup of water and we're gonna bring this to a bowl I'm gonna add two teaspoons of sugar all right I ingredients have come to a ball now I've got this on high right now but I'm gonna turn it down to kind of a medium moderate heat and I'm just gonna dump in that all-purpose flour and I'm gonna add the zest of one orange and I'm gonna continue to cook this and mix it until it kind of comes away from the pan and forms a ball and you can see it's following the spoon around and I've got everything mixed up all the flour has disappeared so now I'm gonna transfer it to our Bowl and that's gonna help cool it off you can see how stiff fattiness all right now to help it cool down a little bit faster I'm gonna just give it a little mix with an electric mixer and like I said that's just gonna move that batter around and cool it off and after it cools off a second I've got four eggs and I'm gonna add those eggs one at the time to our batter so one at the time I'm going to drop in the eggs [Applause] so I can't beat none till I have a smooth batter force and now I'm going to move it over into our piping bag and this is barely warm now from all that beating and that orange zest smells so nice in there all right now we're gonna move down to the deep fryer now the recipe calls for a temperature of 350 degrees and we're going to come down here and we're gonna drop these into four inch pieces in the hot oil I think these are gonna be delicious I don't think we can go wrong with fried dough at all right now the first two are starting to brown a little bit for us so I'm making sure that I keep them turned so they don't Brown too too bad on one side all right we're gonna take these up and let them train for a second on a paper towel and since I forgot my nutmeg I'm just gonna come down here you know no harm no foul I'm just gonna add it in the last step all right now I've got plenty of nutmeg in it but put this in your batter because it'll be even more intense and I'm gonna take 1/2 a cup of sugar 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and that was probably 1/4 or teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg and I'm just gonna mix that all together real good and then we're gonna take a chi rose and we're gonna toss them in that sugar while they're still warm you know once you use fresh nutmeg you never want to go back to that ground nutmeg in the can mmm you can see how quick and simple and easy that was all right so don't these look wonderful and you can see why a cup of coffee or a glass of a mug of hot chocolate would just be wonderful to eat along with these mmm they're not too sweet the sweetest part is the sugar that we rolled them in but the actual cake is is like just right it's just strong with with the orange zest [Music] you
