- I am gonna share with y'all today, or I'm gonna try to. share with y'all today, a dish that I love so much. Souffles. And I had asked my friends. at my magazine, you know, if they would please. put in a souffle recipe. Well, they did. And it's in this issue. This is on the stand right now. Isn't it, y'all? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. It's the-. - "Southern Suppers"? - [Theresa] Mm-hm. - Well, this is what I'm. gonna prepare for us, a lemon souffle. So I wanna tell y'all... All right, now. The recipe calls for. you to take your brush and brush the butter using. bottom-to-top strokes. I don't know what difference that makes, but I'm doing what they say. 'Cause it's been years, honey. In fact, Art Smith has a restaurant in Washington. He has one somewhere else too. And I can't remember the name of it, but one time I was up in Washington, DC, and we went to his restaurant, but he also had us to his. house, Michael and me, for dinner, and, oh, it a wonderful dinner. I can't remember exactly what he prepared, but it was delicious. And after we got through eating, he jumped up and started doing... I said, Art, what in the. world are you doing now? He said, well, I got,. I'm making our dessert. And I said, oh, what is it? And he said, a lemon souffle. Well, honey, it was all I could do not to ram my tongue down. in that dish and lick it. So if y'all ever get a chance to go to one of Art Smith's restaurants, you need to do that. All right. So. I have taken my dish and buttered it. Now I'm going very gently try to... shake some sugar in there. And I'm just gonna try. to beat off the excess. So it's kind of like, you know, shortening and flour in a pound cake. All right. So let's see. There we go. Okay, so our dish is ready. And now our next step is... Art made this look so simple, y'all. He had this thing... He had us eatin' souffle in 20 minutes. It was so quick. - [Theresa] Do you think you're gonna have it done in 20 minutes? - No. (Paula chuckling) No! All right. I'm gonna take my flour, my sugar, and my salt. And I'm gonna sift that using my whisk. And this whisk acts almost like a sifter. All right. And the next thing I'm gonna put in is about a fourth of a cup of milk. Maybe a little bit more than that. And I'm gonna whisk this together. You know, you can make. savory souffles too, but honey, given a choice, I. want a sweet souffle, please. Please. All right, now the next thing I'm gonna do is add our four egg yolks. And while I'm doing that,. I'm gonna come over here, and I'm gonna put a cup. of milk in our saucepan. And I'm gonna turn that on. kind of more to the low side. And I don't wanna boil. this, but I wanna scald it. So scalding is just when you're... The rim is about to start bubbling. So I'm gonna beat this until. it's smooth as I can get it. (Paula beating eggs) Okay. That looks pretty. smooth, doesn't it? That looks smooth to me. Okie doke. And now we just gonna wait for this to come to a scalding stage, and then we're gonna mix. this thing all together. We're gonna put it in the oven, and it's gonna be fabulous. I hope! (Paula laughing) Our milk is scalded. You know, it wasn't boiling, but you can see where it started. bubbling around the edges. So I'm gonna pour about. half of this hot milk into our flour mixture. (Paula beating the eggs) And it's like, we kind. of tempering those eggs, because we don't want scrambled, lemon scrambled eggs. All right, just a little bit more. And now we're gonna put. this back into the pot with the rest of the hot milk. How about this? (Paula chuckling) I'm gettin' my exercise. Make sure... that I get every drop of this out. And now to this. I'm gonna add my lemon zest. Mm. Ooh, it smells so good. Mm, mm, mm. I'm gonna add my lemon juice. And my butter. It's not much butter for souffles, y'all. (Paula turning on a gas burner) All right, and I'm gonna continue to cook this just until. it starts to thicken. I've got the egg whites from my four... eggs that we separated. Now, I'm going to plug this in. (Paula chuckling) I almost didn't remember. to plug it in, Theresa. All right, let's see. Okay. (mixer whirring) How are you looking, girlie? - [Theresa] I'm looking good. Don't forget your cream of tartar. I think it tells you to. add that to the egg whites. - Yeah. All right. Let me see. (mixer whirring) Yes. They want 'em all together. So that's like a fourth a teaspoon of cream of tartar. And our instructions. say to whip it on low. (mixer whirring) And then go to high. (beaters hitting side of the bowl) I'm gonna kind of slowly add. my sugar to my egg whites. Now, it's important when. you're making a merengue to make sure your beaters. are spotlessly clean and your bowl. Because if there's anything that can get in those egg whites, they will play with it and mess it up. (beaters hitting the side of the bowl) Now in the recipe, it will tell you, if you over-beat your egg whites, there's a good chance that. your souffle won't make, so you just don't wanna. beat them until they're dry, but you do wanna beat 'em. until it forms stiff peaks. Okay, we're down to the last step. And it seems like it's taken me an awfully long time to do this. But I think once I've done it, in the recent past, that I won't be as slow with it next time. All right, so I'm gonna add about one cup of our merengue into our custard. And I'm gonna just try to do this gently until it's completely combined. Now, if this doesn't turn out, y'all, I'm gonna show it to you anyway. (Paula chuckling) Because this is not trick-you cooking. I don't want to try to trick anybody. All right, I think that's. completely combined. Now we're just gonna put. the rest of it in there. These egg whites look beautiful. And then I'm just gonna gently fold... them into the... (spoon rapping against the bowl) into the rest of the custard mix. (spoon rapping against bowl's edge) And the fold, it's down. and over, down and over, down and over. I think it's good. - [Theresa] I have faith that. this is gonna be fabulous. - [Paula] I hope. - [Theresa] What do you think, Eddie? - [Eddie] Looks good. Looks... - [Paula] Eddie's smart. He's not gonna commit yet. (Paula laughing) - [Eddie] I'll eat it. - [Theresa] I trust that magazine. - [Eddie] Whether it rises or not. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] I'm with you, Eddie. (spoon rapping against bowl's edge) - [Theresa] I'm gonna trust the magazine. - Oh. If it doesn't rise, I will rise to the. occasion and eat it anyway. (Paula chuckling) How about that? Okay. And you wanna make. sure that rim is clean. All right, so it's ready to go. And it says to bake this. for 30 to 35 minutes on 350. Oh! To the souffle gods. Please let this work. If it doesn't, I'm eatin' it anyway. (Paula chuckling) I think, I think it's done, Eddie. Uh, but it did not rise. It started to. It wanted to. Right there. But like I said, it's. just been a long time. So... It's back to the drawing. board for old Paula. (Paula chuckling ruefully) But I say it's still gonna be good. Look at that. You want it like puddin' in the center. - [Eddie] Looks good. - Doesn't it look delicious? And you know what, y'all? I forgot. I wanted to make an. anglaise to pour over it when I served everybody a bowlful, and I forgot. Mm. Mm! - [Eddie] I don't think. I've ever had a souffle. Is it like angel food? - [Theresa] Oh, no. - Uh-uh. It's like... It's like that. I really, really, really. love it so much better with an anglaise. And an anglaise is just. like a cooked custard. You know, and then you just. pour it on top of your souffle, and, honey, it will not your socks off. - [Theresa] Let me tell you, that is good. (Paula chuckling). And I've had souffles. - Well. - I've had lots of souffles. That's good.. - Mm. Well, y'all, eat up. I still got to work on it some more. And next time, I want to do. mine like Art did in the... See, it's kind of got a puddin'-y center? - [Eddie] So, I mean, do. you, can you eat it cold too? - Yeah, I guess you could, but... - [Eddie] You're supposed to eat it hot. - [Theresa] It's a hot.. - Yeah. - I mean, you're supposed to take it right out of the oven and... - Just like what I'm doing. - Yeah. Dip it. And then like she said, a lot of 'em will have, like, you'll pour something right on top or in the middle of it.. - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Oh, they're so good. But I think that is a good, I mean that... I think there's something. wrong with our dish, to be honest. - For being a long time, it's not bad. - [Theresa] Uh-uh. - So, really, it's so good. Mm. But, you could see where it wanted to start puffing up right there, but it should have been like that high. Mm, mm! I'm double dippin'. (Paula chuckling) Love y'all. Love and best dishes.
