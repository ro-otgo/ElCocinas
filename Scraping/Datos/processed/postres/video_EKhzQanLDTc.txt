[Music] on today's show we've really had some belly gratifying foods so to finish up today I want something a little bit lighter and we're gonna do a nice strawberry mold and it's so simple so easy but yet so tasty we're starting here with frozen strawberries so you don't have to worry you can make this year-round and right now you see that I'm just trying to mash some of the excess liquid out of them and you can see it drain it down into the bowl and I just bet we can find another use for that strawberry juice and you can swap around your flavors I'm using a strawberry gelatin today we're gonna use two three ounce packs that smell so good it smells like cotton candy coming up my nose and we're gonna add about a cup of boiling water we're just gonna whisk that together until it's kind of dissolved and while that's doing its thing we're gonna come over here we're gonna take three bananas and we're just gonna mash them up now you can do this several ways you can actually use a mixer to do it you can use your hands or you can use the fork or you can actually break your banana up while it's in the peel which is a pretty good way to do it too so there's several different ways you can do this but I'm going to continue on with my fork and we're gonna leave some chunky little pieces of banana in it that looks just right and we're gonna do a little bit more pressing alright we've got most of it out so we're gonna just pour that in and we've got a cup of canned crushed pineapple and you're gonna want to make sure that you get all the juice out of it too it's like I said you don't want too much liquid going in this dish Oh pretty pretty pretty colors I have made this for my family for years they just love it in fact this will almost serve as a dessert by the time we get through with it we're just gonna fold that all together and the last thing we're gonna add to it is about a cup of pecans that looks like about a cup doesn't it see how good that looks now we're going to lightly spray our dish and we're just gonna ladle look yummy we're just gonna ladle about half of this into our pan that looks about it you know this is another one of those little recipes that you can switch about any way you like to you can swap different flavors you could even add little miniature marshmallows to this would be delicious all right so all we're gonna do at this point is put it into the refrigerator and to finish this dish is so simple the secret ingredient to this dish is the sour cream it gives it such a nice little twang that you're not expecting and we're gonna put about a cup on our first layer and smear it out that looks heavenly already doesn't it all that's left to do now is to put the reserve topping on top and it's ready my little children just love this dish when they were little boys all we have to do is put it in the fridge let this continue to set real good and then pull it out and it's ready and guess what it's ready what a nice finish to such a rich brunch let's see what it tastes like looks delicious this really doesn't need much garnish but I'm gonna put just a pretty fresh strawberry there with it and maybe a little sprig of mint let's see if I can scrape me out just a little dollop of sour cream how nice is that let's see what this sweet baby is going to taste like it's just tongue titillating [Music]
