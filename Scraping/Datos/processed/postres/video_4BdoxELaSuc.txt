- Well, Q, I'm here in. the kitchen with Q, y'all, and she is fixing up. the last of her recipes that she's here today to share with us. Hopefully, she'll come back, I hope so. You are doing the white. chocolate brownies. - Yes, yes. - I am all in on this one. Poor Theresa, Theresa does. the shopping for our recipes. How many stores did you go. to to find white chocolate? White chocolate, is that a cheesecake? Or just pudding?. - [Theresa] No, that was just a white chocolate pudding. I went to three. (Q laughing). - You sound so happy about it. - [Theresa] Well, I read the. directions wrong to begin with. So, I bought chocolate pudding,. not white chocolate pudding. So I had to go back and correct myself, and that was not as easy as. I thought it was gonna be. - Yeah, she--. (all laughing) - Sometimes she can be. hardheaded, too, also. - So we're gonna start with. Super Moist white cake mix. That's all you need. - Okay. - If you choose to use a. different brand, that's fine. But white cake mix is the kicker. - Okay. I love recipes. that start with a cake mix because we know they're gonna be doable. - Right, exactly. - So this is gonna make a. big old pan of brownies, isn't it?. - It will. Well, it'll be thick just enough. It won't be thin, it'll be. thick like a brownie should be. So why don't you just do that.. - Okay. - And then we're gonna add two. boxes of the white chocolate. - It's hard to find.. - It's hard to find. (all laughing) - I can't believe the big grocery store out here didn't have it. Oh, I didn't get that all in there. (package rustling) What is that stuck in that bottom? (tapping box) - She won't go behind me this time. (both laughing) - Ain't nothing left in that box. - See, see, see? (Paula laughing). So we're gonna begin to fold. We're gonna fold in some. white chocolate chips, about a half a cup.. - About a half a cup, looks like. And you got some vegetable oil. - I do, I do. - And that's three quarters. of a cup it looks like. - Two thirds.. - Two thirds. Yeah, yeah. That's what it is. - We're gonna do two thirds, two times. - Would you like me to. beat these eggs for ya, or? - [Theresa] So, you. need two thirds for one, - So you did need a cup and a third. - Yeah. Yeah. So we add. (laughs) (Paula laughing) I hope that all the people. work for me watch this, so they can understand why I say, make sure you get every drop. - [Paula] Q, I can't-- - The expert even says that. - [Theresa] So, one third of a cup? - Two thirds. - [Paula] I can't help it, Q. - She's got it. - [Paula] You know, if you've ever, - The drippings and the last little bits. - [Paula] If you ever.... - All of that. Yes. Ma'am.. - [Paula] If you've ever been without, Q. - So it's two two thirds of vegetable oil. - [Theresa] So that's actually. a one and a third cup. - [Paula] Yes, yes.. - One and a third cup. - [Theresa] Look at all of us. with those great math minds. calculating in our heads. - Better y'all than me,. 'cause I don't... (laughs) - So what I was saying, if. you've ever been without, it makes you very conscious. - Of throwing away stuff.. - Of throwing away stuff, yes. Are you ready for your eggs?. - I am. - And I asked if you want me to beat 'em but I didn't hear an answer, so I just beat 'em anyway. Hope that's okay.. - [Q] We'll take it. - [Paula] Now, do you need. the hand mixer for this, Q? - [Q] No, you just fold these.. - [Paula] Oh wow! - [Q] Oh, yeah. You just fold 'em. And they'll come together and then once you fold them, - [Paula] Uh-huh. - [Q] Mix it together. - [Paula] Oh my goodness. - [Q] And it's gonna come together just like a brownie mix, like it should. And it's gonna end up being. really good brownie texture. When I make these at the shop, Q's Cakes, they absolutely love 'em. This is sort of a treat. I don't make this particular. brownie every day. So they'll be glad to see this video so they can make this. (Paula laughs). - Oh, good. - Yes, yes, yes, that's why-- - No chocolate, no milk. chocolate, or anything? It's all white chocolate - White chocolate, white chocolate. And this is a recipe that I came up with on my own. - [Paula] So you formulated this? - [Q] I formulated this. - [Paula] And did I hear. you say that you spray this? - Yes, I spray the pan. - You hadn't sprayed it though, right? - I have not. - Okay.. (spraying can) I will do that for you, miss chefie. - I Appreciate it. - Oh, here's my here's my other spatula. I like it 'cause it's... - [Theresa] A bit pliant? - Yeah. And my aunt Peggy gave this to me. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. Yes. I like it. What is this? - My bracelet. - Oh, is that your... what bracelet is that? I have one, but it kept coming unscrewed. - Mine too. - [Male voice] Your Tiffany? - Oh wait, this one shut. - [Male voice] Cartier? - Yeah. What is supposed to be an "I love you" bracelet. or something like that. Well, anyway, it fell off your arm. - It did. That's okay. - [Paula] And I would. hate to have to wear it, keep it and wear it.. (Paula laughs) - So I'm just putting. this in the pan evenly. - [Paula] Mm-hm. So you. pattin' it in there? - [Q] Yes. This is a lot of goodness right here. - Oh Lord have mercy, how. many calories are in it? (Paula laughs) - Ooh, be quiet.. (both laugh) - Shut up, Paula! - All right, so we're gonna put this in the oven for about 25 minutes. - You think that'll cook in 25 minutes, Q? - Mm-hm. - What temperature? 350? - 350. - I don't know what to say about this. (Paula laughs) White chocolate brownies. They're beautiful, And Q just took her white chocolate-- - Chips. - Chips, and she put two. tablespoons of oil in it, and heated it in the microwave. until the consistency is just right. So let's get our straw. (both laugh) and have a sip. - I know, right? - No she-- - So we're gonna pour, and she's gonna spread. - [Paula] Oh, gosh. Now how many chips was that? - [Q] One...was it a nine ounce bag? - [Theresa] It was a 12 ounce. - [Q] 12 ounce bag. - [Paula] 12 ounce bag. - [Theresa] We used the half a cup to go into the brownie,. - [Paula] Okay. - [Theresa] and then the. remainder of the bag-- - [Paula] is here.. - [Theresa] Mm-hm. Perfect. - [Paula] Okay. I got. turn this plate around but it gonna be so, oh, thank you. It gonna be so hot. Oh, my goodness, y'all. Now, when did you formulate this? Have you had it a long time? - Yes, I've had it a long time. - Holy moly. Okay. Do you need this to. get it all out with or...? So, you know what? - What are you thinking? - I'd probably add some nuts on top now. - I know. - I would love some nuts. Gimme that cup girl, you know. I got clean that thing out. (Paula laughs) - Uh-oh, you still got a lot. - Yeah, it's a little bit too much. - You think it's too much?. (all laugh) How about that, Q? - Now it's maybe too much.. (Paula laughs) I'm sorry, I can't help it. - Yeah, she needs a straw.. (Q laughs) (tapping) - Now. You know, we got. some more, if you want it. - It's something you told. me to remind you to say. - What did I--? oh, oh,. oh, I know what it is. I asked you to remind me. Q has joined me for sharing. three of her recipes with me. But when we first started out, we did just a video of us talking, and her sharing a little. bit of her story with you. - Yes.. - So I hope, so this'll be the fourth video, three. cooking and one talking with Q, and I do hope y'all will make sure that you see all four of 'em. And if you're ever in all Albany, drop in to see her and. see her vending machine. - Yes. At "Q's Cakes done. the old fashioned way." - And it's in northwest Albany. - It is, 2700 Dawson rd. suite 17. Yes. - And, oh my goodness, this looks so good. So what do you think about the nuts? - I think you can add toasted. nuts to it if you like. And it would be amazing. I've done it before at home. - Oh my gosh. - Yes. - Ooh, ooh. I just love nuts. - I do, too. - I just, I think they add so much to it, and the older I get the more I'm kind of leaning towards walnuts. - You like walnuts better? - I love walnuts. - I Like pecans. - Peecans, yeah. - Okay, peecans.. (Paula laughs) - Peecans! So you say pecans? - Yes. - It just depends on what you. learned as a child, I guess. Doesn't it? - It does. - What your mom and daddy called it. (Paula laughs) - Did we have a...? - Yes, I think I put it back in here, Q. - Okay. - Somewhere. I think I did. - Can we use the-- - Yes, that one. That one's hard for me to see right there. Oh, oh, oh, ooh! So something... - [Q] Oh my Lord. - [Paula] Holy camoly. (Q laughs) - Now, is this one gonna be. too hot for me to eat as well? - Yes. - So something else Eddie. was sharing with me... Oh my goodness, look at this stuff. Look at that stuff.. (both laugh) - [Theresa] Almost looks. like a gooey butter. - [Paula] I know. - What was Eddie sharing with you? (laughter) - Whap. Whap, make you slap your friend. (Both laugh) Eddie was telling me. that somebody said that I say his name too much. (All laugh) And I knew that! I know that I'm saying it too much. You think it's too much on these videos? You ain't seen nothing till. we turn the camera off. "Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!". (all laugh) If I can't get him that way,. I call him on the telephone. But, so you're exactly right. Whoever said that out. there and I'm trying to be conscious of not saying. that word too much anymore. - Lies.. (Paula laughs) And no more hate emails. (Paula laughs). - Yeah, no. Let me tell y'all, this tastes like a warm glazed donut. - It sure does, it sure does. - That is it, and if you. like warm glazed donuts, you going to love Q's recipe. - Yes. - For white chocolate brownies. - It's amazing. - (muffled) It is delicious..
