- All right, I've got about a. half a cup of orange marmalade that I do love on a. bagel with cream cheese. Now, I'm going to just warm that slightly. And this is gonna be our. Fourth of July dessert for the children. So, maybe the mamas can't. say, oh, it's too much sugar. Since it's going to be a fruit pizza, maybe we can get away with it. So, I know you have all. probably seen the fruit pizzas and it's one of those things, excuse me, that you can do it any way you want to. But since it's the Fourth of July, I am just sticking with. red fruit, blue fruit, and banana is going to have to. work as our white, excuse me. Whoa, Paula, you turned too quick. I got dizzy. All right, yeah, that's warm. Okay, so to make our cookie, all you need is one like 17 ounce. roll of a sugar cookie. You know, they come in the. log and you can either try to roll it out. Personally, I don't like to do that. I like to just slice it and. pat it out with my hands and that way I know it's even and cook it for the proper amount of time. So, and it's best that. you do this beforehand so it has time to cool. So now, we're going to. take our cream cheese that we have let soften. I do love cream cheese. And I'm using, excuse me for licking my fingers. I'm going to use a half a. teaspoon of an orange extract, which is so nice and fresh. Okay, so we're going to come down here and mix this with that wonderful. aromatic orange extract. You know, we used to give. our children and myself as a child an ice cream that. was called a dreamsicle. And it was vanilla ice. cream with an orange cream like it was dipped, like they dipped the vanilla. into this orange cream and it was so good. So, this particular extract is so good. I think I might soften. some vanilla ice cream and drop in a few drops. of the orange extract and sit back and let my. memories take me away. I'm going to stir that and make sure there's no lumps in it. Make sure it's got enough orange extract. And I don't think it does. So, I'm going to add just a wee bit more. Let's see if that takes it to. where I'd like for it to be. So, that would be about. a teaspoon that I used. That's a little better, but I think I'm gonna reach over here and grab my lemon extract and put a little lemon in it. To take me to where I want to go. Okay, so, Eddie found. it up in the cabinet. I have forgotten about,. I used this other day. I made a lemon pound cake, y'all, using Mama's pound cake recipe and I made a lemon glaze. That cake was so delicious. So, I had used this extract in that cake. Okay, so let's see, you know, preparing food. And what you're going to. give your a family is really all it needs to pass is your taste test. That's a little bit more of. a little bit of bite to it. So we're going to come down here and we're going to take our cream cheese and we're going to frost our big cookie. So hopefully, we'll. have enough cream cheese to complete our job. Your children, if you. would call your children into the kitchen to help. you with this process, they would have a ball. So, since this is a. Fourth of July dessert, we should try to do the red,. white, and blue, shouldn't we? - That's what we've got. - The white bananas, the. strawberries, and the blueberries. So I'm going to ask you to put. your artistic eyeball on it. - But we don't have to a, we. want to do a flag or do you... - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter. - This is your pallet. - Okay. - It's your pallet. I'm going to be the fruit slicer. All right, those have been washed. Those are ready to go. Now, I'm going to mix. up a little Fruit-Fresh because the bananas... - Now, where does this come in? - [Woman] At the very end. - At the very end. - Yeah, that was kind of unfair. You can read the recipe. It's very simple. It's kind of do it like you want it. The actual recipe called. for a lot more fruit but Theresa wanted us to just stick to our red, white, and blue. So, I've got some Fruit-Fresh here. That I'm going to. sprinkle on these bananas or if you don't have Fruit-Fresh, you can use lemon juice,. or lime juice even, orange juice will help. slow it down a little bit. Okay, then we go in Fruit-Fresh, you will find in the canning. section at your grocery store. You know, where they keep. the jars, the canning jars and things like that. So, I'm just going to. sprinkle a little bit on it and then I'm going to add. just a touch of water, so it can all get coated. What you want, pumpkin? Pumpkin wants... - [Eddie] She wants... - [Paula] Pizza pie? - [Eddie] Food. - [Paula] And look, there's Gus and Max now they, I said something about pumpkin and then here they go. All right, here's your banana, Eddie. - [Eddie] All right. - [Paula] You know, if. ya'll make this pizza, send us some pictures. because I just love to know what's in y'all's head and. how y'all would do things. So, send us a picture if you decide to create your recipe of the fruit pizza because I would love to see it. - [Woman] I'm going to give Eddie a break and let him keep doing his creation. - [Paula] Okay, and then come back? - [Woman] And then we'll come back. - [Paula] That sounds wonderful. Wah-lah! - [Woman] I haven't done the big reveal. - [Paula] Look, look. at Eddie's fruit pizza. All right, Eddie, our. instructions are to brush on... - [Eddie] Warm marmalade. - [Paula] This warm marmalade,. so I'm just going to kind of dot it around for you. - [Woman] Yeah. - [Paula] And I actually added, cause the marmalade is a little thick, I actually added a. little warm water to it. - [Woman] That looks so good. - [Eddie] So that's going to. add a lot of orange flavor. - [Woman] That's going. to add some flavor too. - [Paula] A lot of orange flavor. Oh, and I added some, yum, I added orange extract to this one too. To the orange marmalade, just in case it didn't have enough orange in it. - [Woman] That looks great. - [Paula] Isn't that beautiful? - [Woman] Yes. - [Paula] Eddie is so a talented. Where do you feel like I. need to do this all last drop of orange marmalade, baby? - [Eddie] Right there. - [Paula] Right in there. - [Paula] Yeah, that's what I thought. - [Woman] Kind of empty. And maybe I can get one. more little spec for you by using my rubber spatula. - [Woman] I always have to go to you trying to get the very last drop. - [Paula] My handy dandy rubber spatula. All right, do you have,. look, see how much I got? Now, most folks would have left that. - [Eddie] Right there. - [Paula] Would have left. that in that bowl, but not me. You would've thought I lived during the depression, y'all. Yummy. But now, here are the directions serve and eat immediately, because, because your bananas are gonna turn on you if you're not careful. And that's why I use the Fruit-Fresh to help give them a little extra life. - [Eddie] Yeah, the marmalade. should kind of help that too. - [Paula] Yeah, help. give it a little coat, but the Fruit-Fresh is really. the one that's gonna... - [Woman] Now that's sugar. cookie on the bottom? - [Paula] Yes. Eddie, I'm going to. give you a paper plate. - [Eddie] I've got some right here. - [Paula] You've got paper plates? - [Eddie] No, I've got real plates. - [Paula] Oh no, I want. to take a paper plate out to the grandchildren. - [Eddie] Okay. - [Paula] Because I don't. want no China by the pool. - [Woman] I think Bobby. Dean will appreciate that. - [Paula] He's not going. to appreciate the fact though that we're bringing them pie. And they may let them. have it and they may not but that's all right. You want the pie server? - [Eddie] Yeah - [Paula] Look at this, look. at those boys over there. He's playing and playing and playing. - [Woman] I Think Gus must be. - [Paula] Gus. - [Woman] I think Gus is tired. - [Paula] Gus, what are you doing, buddy? - [Woman] Say I'm checking it all out. - [Paula] Ooh. - [Woman] Oh look. - [Eddie] Are you going. to take three pieces or are you going to take...? - [Paula] Yeah, let's take a few because - [Woman] Will you turn it. around so I can kind of see that? - [Paula] The swimming coach. - [Woman] Look. - [Paula] Isn't that gorgeous? Give me that blueberry, honey. And I'll take some. - [Eddie] It's like Queen Elizabeth cutting that cake with that big sword. - This fruit pizza is. out this world y'all and the triplets are out doing. their survival swimming class. So, I'm going to take this and maybe Mama and Papa. will let them have some. And I want Mr. Steven,. the teacher, to have some. So, Mr. Steven, we just. made a fruit pizza. - [Mr. Steven] Awesome. - And I've cut you a slice over there. - [Mr. Steven] Okay. - So make sure you don't leave without it. - [Mr. Steven] Will do. - You need some bulking up. - I do. I need more fruit pizza. - [Paula] And it's delicious. - [Mr. Steven] I bet it is. - [Paula] Jackie, you make. sure to get some too, honey. - I will, thank you. - [Woman] I see you, pretty girl. - [Jackie] Say, "I'm just. working on my starfish." - Oh boy, look at that. - [Mr. Steven] Thank you. - So, just let me know when they're ready. - [Jackie] Yes ma'am, I will. - It's out of this world. Yum, let's go boys.
