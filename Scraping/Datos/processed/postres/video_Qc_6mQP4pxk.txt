hello my dear friends come on into the kitchen with me because i'm working away on our 12 days of christmas cookies and we have finally gotten to one of my favorite cookies that i remember my grandma paul making a lot uh and she called them grandma paul's sand tarts she called them sand tarts i ated the grandma paw uh but i know everybody in the world has eaten this cookie some people call it a wedding cookie some people call it a sandy uh what are some more names theresa that you might know this by but anyway it's that little white like a shortbread cookie rolled in powdered sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven so y'all know what i'm talking about kitties you know what i'm talking about and uh it's as good as any shortbread cookie you'll ever eat so i have two sticks of butter here in my bowl and i don't substitute i use the real deal uh let's see what did grandma used to do okay my two sticks of butter there's really not very many ingredients in this cookie and i think that's probably y'all what makes it so damn gum good so i've got confectionary sugar and i'm gonna beat that with my butter now this is uh that's flour powdered sugar for rolling them in and the flour is for me to get my fingers in so these delicious cookies won't stick to my fingers cause you know i do hate to have to lick my fingers listen i just assume i'm as happy to make these as i am the beaders and the bowl lady what was your favorite christmas cookie eddie that your mama used to make i think um i think the my favorite was the um you know like the egg white uh all the meringues and you know what they're not fattening and they're actually good for you because it doesn't have the yolk in it and egg whites they have no calories but i'm sure your mama put a little sugar in them oh yeah and did you like anything in your meringues uh yes she would put um she would put chocolate chips and raisins sometimes oh my goodness i've never had one crazy it's good yum all right i'm gonna add our vanilla and i'm going to be pretty generous with this vanilla because i really really like it in fact if you um are looking for a hostess gift or you just want to remember somebody that's in your sunday school class or the ladies you played bridge with let me tell you a gift that is so easy to make and so appreciated uh it's homemade vanilla and you can make it using either bourbon or vodka and depending on the the kind of bottle you make it in maybe five to seven uh pods of vanilla and you just split split it down the center and then take a knife and just scrape out all the gooey center to those beans put it over in the liquid of your choice and then stick the beans down in there but here's the deal though you need to start making it like today because if you could if you could let it sit for two months that would be just about perfect but um you put that in a neat jar and put a bow around it i would be so happy for somebody to give me homemade vanilla all right so that's the story moaning glory on that little bit of information now i'm just going to add my flour and we're using all purpose i love a cookie with very few ingredients i like nemo's um christmas cookies that i made earlier but boy heidi it really did have everything but the kitchen sink in it but they were delicious okay so we just want to incorporate this real good i'm gonna turn it up just a little bit so you know let me hear from y'all i would love to know what y'all's favorite christmas cookies are or cookies made at christmas time that you remember your mother or your grandmother making for you uh i'd love to love to hear from y'all man what were the boys favorite you know it's funny but when my boys were young they didn't care too much for sweets and that in that strange of course they love those two brothers chocolate gobs that i've talked about but no they weren't they weren't real big on sweets so all right i'm gonna flour up my hands and i'm gonna get about a tablespoon okay i think maybe i got a little bit more than a tablespoon so grandma call these sand tarts i still got i meant crescent sand tarts so she always made hers i still think that's a little big we're going to shape them like a piece of the moon how does that look eddie looks good now this this reminds me of the uh the greek uh cooking i'm going to redo him crescent huh uh the um greek um people they they make cookies like that in the crescent oh they do like this with the powdered sugar and yes now you can make them in any shape you want to um i normally make them in balls just because it's easier it's faster oh that's more than a moon right there that's a big all right y'all so i did these in different shapes to just show you teresa's mother this is in honor of teresa's mother she made them into fingers because it was easier than making a crescent so we've got some lady fingers lady fingers yeah yeah lady ladyfingers and um i did some in crescent for grandma i did a couple without nuts because teresa just likes a taste of that shortbread and then i did some in balls and nine out of ten times this is the shape that i made mine in again because it was easier so in the oven these go y'all for 40 minutes at 270 i believe it is it theresa 270 okay these magical cookies are out of the oven y'all and i did wind up cooking them for 40 minutes you want one don't you maxi you want a cookie don't you he said i smell something good mama you know it's best to sift your powdered sugar because sometimes it's just can be lumpy and you like it pretty and fine you know for your cookies so we're just gonna roll these cookies and i was just telling eddie and teresa you know i think i'm uh a simplest not a simple ton but a simple list i kind of just like the round cookies you know like you think of wedding cookies and look at these my crescents they wound up being big oh that's a good treat yeah that's for the kitties it's been extra good what did you get a finger or a crescent teresa oh yeah your nutless one although the crescents are right pretty aren't they all right we'll do one of theresa's fingers now the fingers that would be easier to eat you know just slap down on that thing michael grover could eat this whole tray by himself eddie's getting pretty close too oh now gus you smell something good don't you look at these pitiful hungry dogs eddie say i'm so hungry uh oh that one's broken too that's perfect i'd love to give you all some but i don't think that's really especially good for you i think that they heard the word cookie way too many times today saying give me that damn good i've heard you talk about it all day oh these are big crescents so the dough y'all is really not that sweet so you have to have the powdered sugar so you'll know that you've had a cookie something delectable and sweet and i will probably now i will probably wound up running these through the powdered sugar twice go see it that first time it almost melts it almost melts the powdered sugar because you're still warm so i'll just go back and re-dust those just like that on most of my things it says one time very rarely died just do it one time like i i don't think you've ever tasted my little bite-sized cakes eddie uh the lemon blossoms the lemon blossoms and the orange blossoms oh my goodness you make them a miniature muffin tins and then it said to drop them down into this uh powdered sugar sweet glaze and i always did those twice and you talk about good we ought to make some of those one day we will i'm adding that to the recipe oh okay because you talking about easy and delicious and i mean bite size bite size perfect as long as you have about six of them exactly what was that little pecan have we ever made that you remember when people had muffins the mini ones yes have we ever made them by shower i don't think so we've uh let's see i know we've made them like on some of your you know like uh shop hq i think um oh yes we did we did in the airfryer they yeah they're so good they're mmm those are delicious and eddie and i was in america's georgia we were down there to do something for mr jimmy president jimmy carter and um we stayed up a beautiful hotel an older town in america america's georgia is such a point really beautiful place paul i think this is a good one too i just got an email from a woman by the name of karen rock and she would like us here in rock uh-huh i think that's how you would say her last name i could be failed are you okay right she was saying that she would love if we would do some things that could end up being um like care package type foods oh my gosh she is in the military and they do so that would be fabulous wouldn't it yes so karen that too is coming any of the things that we've done today i mean this is a delicate cookie right here but you know it depends on how you pack them now if you did them all like this those would pack up so beautifully uh i know when my bubba moved out to missouri i would send him care packages of my homemade cookies and oh my gosh he enjoyed him so much and he loved taking him into work you know and sharing his cookies with all his buddies one of his favorites was my peanut butter cookie and my extra thin chocolate chip cookie in fact michael was telling me last night he said you know we had made those cornflake cookies and i said michael this might be my favorite new cookie my new favorite cookie and he said oh no paula he said you're thin and crispy chocolate chip cookie it's like no other isn't that a beautiful tray of cookies y'all this one's hard to beat i know hard-hearted horrible cookies you know what it doesn't taste too far off of the corn flakes now it's got that same familiar taste so what do we we have four four cookies right now so we got eight more to go look at these beautiful tread cookies we got cousin johnny's whoopie pies we've got grandma paws uh sand tart we've got meamos kitchen sink cookies which are good
