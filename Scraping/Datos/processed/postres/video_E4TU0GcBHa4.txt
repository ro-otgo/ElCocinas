- Hey, y'all I got the sweetest letter from a man named Ron Thompson. And he said, "Dear Paula and team, "I have so enjoyed watching. your videos over the past year. "Like others, I drink my coffee with you, "Theresa, and Eddie every morning. "The casual format is perfect "and I really feel like. I'm there with you guys." Ron, thank you. 'Cause that means the world to me and Eddie and Theresa, that you feel like you're here with us. 'Cause that's our goal is to really drag you into our kitchen. So he sent me a recipe for. a chocolate chip poundcake that his mother has been. making for so many years, she can't remember. And it's funny, Ron, because I've got a chocolate chip recipe in my first cookbook. And I was thinking the other day, I thought I ought to make. that chocolate chip poundcake 'cause it's so easy and it's very good. So I pulled out my cookbook to see what the difference was. And there's several things. that you do differently that I really liked the sound of. So you may have me off of my. own recipe and onto this one. Even though it's old to. your family, it's new to me. So here it goes. And it's so easy. It's so easy. It's one box of yellow cake mix. And literally you just mix. all the ingredients together. I think this is one of those. cakes you could just stir up and it'd be fine. All right, one small package of vanilla or French instant pudding. That's gonna make it light and fluffy. One eight-ounce cup of sour cream. Now, my recipe didn't call for sour cream, but my grandmother's. poundcake that's ever so good calls for sour cream. So we know that that's gonna. be very, very good in there. Okay. Let's see what the next thing is now. Four eggs. (eggs rattling) (eggs tapping) Michael makes his own. breakfast every morning and he brought this little. trinket from the grocery store. And he wants eggs for. breakfast in the morning. And it's like a little egg poacher that you put in the microwave. Have you all seen those? He can cook the most. wonderful poached eggs in that little thing in like 45 seconds. Alright, so let's see what. the next ingredient is. 1/2 a cup of oil. And Ron said he uses canola. - [Theresa] And that is canola - [Paula] And that is canola. 1/2 a cup of water. And a six-ounces milk chocolate. chip bar, slightly chopped. Theresa did a good job chopping that. - [Theresa] I grated it. - You grated it (laughs). All right. And then one bar of. semi-sweet baker's chocolate. Well, Ron. I didn't have quite six. ounces of chocolate. So I finished it off with. white chocolate chips. And I love them. All right, so we gonna beat. this, maybe two minutes. I think that's what it. says on the cake mix box. Now where mine was a little different, mine called for a cup, I mean a package of vanilla pudding and a package of chocolate pudding. But like I said, yours has got sour cream. Mine doesn't. I really, really think that you gonna have me converted, son. You gonna have old mama converted. Now, because these are chunky, I'm gonna wait and I'm. gonna stir those in. So I won't beat them up too bad. Now we're just gonna, (beaters tapping) we're just gonna stir in the white and what chocolate chips I had. This is gonna be so good. You know what I'm gonna do? Ron, and I hope you don't mind, I'm just gonna add a. little vanilla flavoring. That's probably two teaspoons. Ooh, I can't wait to taste this. I think my version looked a. little bit more chocolatey, but I'm sure that's because of the little package. of chocolate pudding. Okay. So now I'm just gonna. spray my pan real good so we don't have any. trouble in them getting low. So I got a tiddly bit of one and a tidily bit of another. (pan spray whooshing) Oh, I can't believe this has. just made the whole cake. Whole cake pan. Okay, so here we go. This is a real thick batter, Ron. And Ron told me. I got tickled and I. thought it was so cute. In the directions, you. wanna bake this on 350 in a preheated oven, y'all, and for 55 to 60 minutes. And he said very rarely. does it take 60 minutes for it to cook. He said sometimes. Let's see. Sometimes it's done in 53 minutes. So, I mean, Ron's on that time with me. He's watching that clock. So you know what, Ron? I'm gonna set mine for 50 minutes and I'll start looking at it then and checking it out. 'Cause he said, be sure. not to over bake this. So I sure don't wanna over bake it. Down to the last drop. So... The kitchen crew here will see y'all back in 55 minutes to show y'all Ron's mama's chocolate chip cake. Guess what? Guess what? It was ready in 50 minutes. Perfectly beautiful. And I've got to let it. cool for a few minutes, but it looks so delicious. So here we go, Ron. Wish us luck. Hope it didn't stick. Come on. Come on man. Woo hoo! All right! One little stick. There you go. Never know it stuck. Mm, mm, mm. It is so hot, y'all. Ron, that is ever more, one beautiful cake. Mm! You know, it's probably too hot to eat, but I'm gonna taste it. I'm gonna taste it anyway. And I'm just gonna put. it on my best china. Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh. Like I said, I cooked it for. Wanna turn it towards the. camera so y'all can see. I mean, it is hot hot. Mm. Oh! Look at that. Would y'all look at that! Getting out three forks. And here she comes.. (Theresa laughs) She was sitting down over there, but that's gotten her up. Look at that beautiful cake.. - I thought we were gonna wait but.. - Well, we trying. - I'm glad you didn't.. - We're trying to wait. - [Theresa] We're not, it's not working. - But look at that.. - Especially with sweets. - [Paula] You did so good during Lent. - [Theresa] I know! How did I do that? - [Paula] I don't know. I don't know how you did it.. - I don't either. I'm glad that it's over. Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream. - [Paula] Uh-huh, you know what? I just realized there's no nuts in this. - [Theresa] There's not. Wow it's moist! - Mm! Eddie? You gonna fork you a piece? - [Eddie] I'll get a piece. - This is so good. - [Theresa] See, he's become good. He's no fun. - Here. Look, Theresa's reaching for the plate. - [Theresa] Well, how can you not? Yum! - Thank you so much for sharing. Jesus said to share. Thank you so much, darling.
