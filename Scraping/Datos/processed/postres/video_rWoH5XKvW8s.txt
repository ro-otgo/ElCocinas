let's move on to our apple crisp because it's delicious too i'm gonna cook this in our dutch oven and i'm gonna nestle this pot down into the coals and i'm gonna put hot coals on top of the lid too so it's gonna be just like i'm baking it in the oven at home in fact you don't have to have a campfire to make this you can cook it in the oven all right now i've started with a dozen granny smith apples and i've peeled and cored them and i'm i was in the middle a few minutes ago of zesting a lemon so i'm going to finish this because we're going to put a little zest and a little juice on our apples now if you want to do this up ahead of time you'd want to toss your apples in lemon juice because that would keep them from turning brown and of course i'm fixing to put these on the fire and cook them right away so it's not a big deal but i think the flavor will be nice so i'm going to toss them just in a little bit of juice and i'm going to take half of this zest and i'm going to toss our apples with sugar and golden raisins aren't those raisins pretty so i'm just gonna toss this all together just using my hands and um i think i need to probably spray our dutch oven so it won't stick on us now i'm just gonna pour these sugar and raisin-coated apples into our pot and i'm just going to spread that around in there now i'm going to make the topping for our apple crisp and i'm using a one and a fourth cup of all-purpose flour a cup and a half of light brown sugar i'm just gonna mix those together all right and i'm gonna blend in a stick and a half of butter and i'm just gonna cut it into my flour and my brown sugar i think i'm gonna change bowls i'm gonna take the rest of our lemon zest and throw it over in here and i'm gonna go in for the kill with my hands because the warmth of my hands my body heat is gonna help soften that butter all right now to this i'm gonna add a cup and a half of quick cooking oats i use like the five-minute cooking kind we're gonna toss that in there along with a pinch of cardamom nutmeg and cinnamon and i'm just going to blend those all together really good and then all you have to do now is just sprinkle it over your apples and that flour and sugar and butter is going gonna just go all down in there in between those apples all right so y'all come along with me i'm gonna go back over to the fire and get this nestled in our coals and then before you know it we're gonna be tasting all right here we go now i'm gonna sit that pot right there on those coals and i'm gonna take this one and then i'm gonna just shovel those hot coals on top of our lid so he'll cook all around nice and even all right he's all tended to but i got another one over here then i want to see how it turned out oh look how pretty look how pretty he is he almost looks like a a praline topping oh my goodness and it's fixing to rain i'm gonna have to hurry hurry hurry it's been threatening rain all day today look how good that looks [Music] hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this blast from the past be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as the notification bell to be alerted when i post a video love and best dishes y'all
