- Hey y'all! I've got, I don't know if it's sweet, it's kind, it's thoughtful, it's funny, but I've got a message for y'all today. I had a strawberry and. cream pie on the website. And when these get put on,. I'm not doing the typing. So it can go up any, so screwed up, y'all. So messed up. I hate when that happens. because I don't wanna pass along anything that. doesn't work for y'all. Whether it's my fault, their fault, or whoever's fault it. is, it doesn't matter. It should never happen. But I've got a friend out. there that I've never met. And her name is Courtney Lee. Courtney followed the directions that I had for the strawberry cream pie. It failed. And Courtney fixed it. And she sent out a message to y'all saying this recipe that I'm. gonna give you, the amounts, that will take it from failure to a hero. So Courtney, thank you, honey. If I'm not aware of something. wrong I can't fix it. So I appreciate you caring enough and taking the time to. help me get that fixed. You're sweet. And after you got all. the measurements correct, it's got a lot of five stars on it. So thank you, girl. So put that in your trash pile. if it's the original recipe and only use the one. that Courtney has fixed. So thank you, Courtney. So we've got an eight ounce package of softened cream cheese, a stick of butter that's. at room temperature. We've got a cup and a. half of powdered sugar. We have one cup of a. frozen whipped topping. We've got a teaspoon of vanilla and we've got two teaspoons of sugar. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna beat all this up until it's fluffy. And then we're gonna put it. into a prepared pie crust. Now you can use, like I'm gonna use a graham cracker which is really good. Or if you have a frozen. pastry, or you wanna make your own crust, that's up to you. So any kind of crust. You could even do a chocolate crust. If you like chocolate and strawberries. So. Here we go. In the bowl and I'm gonna. mix these two first. Since they're the harder. of our ingredients. Can see Theresa had these. at room temperature, so they are mixing together. Just perfect. All right, now we're gonna add the cup and a half of powdered sugar. All right, now I'm gonna. add my teaspoon of vanilla. Why do they make these. so hard to stand up? I don't know. So a teaspoon of vanilla. And then I'm gonna add my. two teaspoons of sugar. And then I'm gonna add my cup of... Whoops. I'm going to use my cup of... How come they... Look, that makes me so mad. - [Theresa] I don't know why. - I don't know why they don't make it where they won't stand up. All right, and this is a cup. of my frozen whipped topping. And we're just gonna. beat all this together and then we're gonna put it in our crust. And we're gonna let it set. The recipe that was printed, y'all, on the website had raw eggs in it. And I don't know why in. the world you would find a need to put raw eggs. in this refrigerated pie. Okay. And this dessert is so easy. And when we get through. putting the strawberries on. It's gonna be, look look! The butter packet was stuck to my... (Paula laughs) Okay, so I think that's all we need. Theresa's filming today,. y'all, instead of Eddie. - [Theresa] And Eddie is much. better at this, so please- - No he is not! - [Theresa] He is. He's very good at this. - No, listen, you've been. at it a long time too. You be good too. Doesn't that look pretty? Tastes pretty too. I was gonna say something,. now what was I gonna say? - [Theresa] Tell them what Eddie's doing. - Oh yeah, that's what I was going to do. So y'all. My first time searching for wallpaper. I immediately found the one I wanted. And I didn't look any further. Well Eddie did some research. And come to find out, he. came back and said Paula, that's $1,000 a roll. and you need 22 rolls. I said well we're not. getting that wallpaper. And Eddie said Paula, I can. paint that on the walls. I said well that's wonderful. You know, he graduated from. SCAD which is an art school. So he started painting,. putting the wallpaper on my bathroom walls through. the brushes of paint. So I can't wait to show. y'all when he's through. We've kind of gotten behind on him having time to get in there and paint. So that's what he's doing today and he passed the camera on to Theresa. I cannot wait to show y'all what Eddie has done when he's through. The rate we're going. though it may be a while. Look at that. Look at that. Beautiful filling. And I don't think, how long does it say for us to refrigerate it, Theresa? - [Theresa] It just needs. to set for about 30 minutes. - [Paula] Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think this is gonna... - [Theresa] And then we. can put the toppings on it. - [Paula] Take that long. - [Theresa] But then it does have to go in the refrigerator for about four hours. - Yeah. This is a nice summer dessert, y'all. You don't have to turn. on your oven to make it. - [Theresa] Paula, this is actually gonna air the week of 4th of July. - Oh gosh! - [Theresa] What a great- - This is perfect. You know, I'm celebrating the 4th of July. On the cover of one of my magazines that's really been good to me. and that's Woman's World. And it should be coming out any minute. You know, they bring them out early. They don't wait 'til the 4th of July to bring them out, but. there's some good recipes in that magazine, so. keep an eye out for it. I hope you like it. Okay. (water running) In the refrigerator this goes. And I'll peep in on it. in about 45 minutes. So now we're fixing to do our layering. And I'm gonna do it just like Courtney recommended in her redo of this. I'm gonna layer it with. sliced strawberries. A layer of whipped cream. And I'm using the real deal whipped cream. And for every cup of cream that I use, I like to use a fourth of a. cup of sugar to sweeten it. So I'm just gonna make sure. this is a fourth of a cup. - [Theresa] She doesn't. trust my measuring. - No, I mean, it's so easy.. - I'm kidding. - Your measuring and my measuring. But that, yeah, that's a fourth of a cup. So I'm gonna beat this a little bit. So we're just gonna start layering. Which way do I wanna point them? I think maybe like that don't you? Almost feel like I need tweezers. (Paula chuckles) Least I get these all screwed up. - [Theresa] Paula, while you do that. - Yes. - [Theresa] I'm gonna take a break so we can check on what's in the oven. - Okay, perfect. I'm not having to be as particular. With the inside like I was on the outside because we're gonna cover. it with whipped cream. Oh my gracious. This is so pretty. And I can't use but. half that whipped cream because we're gonna put. another layer of strawberries. Another lawyer of. strawberries, so I'm gonna need more whipped cream. for the next layer. Okay. All right, so to me what makes this so great for the 4th of July, Theresa, is you could always come. in with some blueberries. I mean to me this is pretty. with just strawberries, but you could come in with blueberries and have the red, white, and blue. I forgot to put the. strawberries in the center. That's all right. That is all right, Paula. Ann, you just keep... - [Theresa] We were so busy. talking about blueberries. - And laughing. Lord have mercy. - [Theresa] Well that's one thing I love that you show is it's okay to mess up. - [Paula] It is okay to mess up. - [Theresa] and this isn't. gonna taste any worse. It's actually gonna be better. - [Paula] You know, stuff happens. It just happens. Sometimes, girly. All right, now I wonder what I need to do if I need to just cap it with some pretty whole strawberries or, let's see. - [Theresa] I was gonna. tell you, if you wanted to do your sliced. strawberries around we could take a second and I could. get you some blueberries. And we have fresh blueberries. - Oh do we have some here? - [Theresa] We do, yes. - Yay! - [Theresa] So we'll be right back. - Yes, I think that would be wonderful. So I'm gonna keep doing... I'm gonna just keep doing this. All right. Courtney, Courtney, Courtney. Thank you for giving a girl a hand. This pie is beautiful. Like I said, perfect for the 4th of July. The longest part is just. putting your strawberries around trying to keep them even, but. look how beautiful it looks. It looks like a flower that's in bloom. And Teresa had blueberries. So now we've got the red,. the white, and the blue. I am so happy and thrilled. To celebrate the 4th of July, y'all. There's a lot of men and. women out there that fight. For us and our freedom. And. To me the 4th of July. represents our freedom. So isn't that pretty? Can you get over it? - [Theresa] Oh yeah. Look how gorgeous. And now- - [Paula] The best part is. it's gonna taste so good. - [Theresa] But you have to wait now. - [Paula] Yes we do. - [Theresa] Tell them how long. - Two hours? - [Theresa] Take that up some. - Three hours? - [Theresa] No, actually. they recommend six hours. Four to six hours for it to set. - We'll be sleeping in six hours. - [Theresa] We won't. - Well that is just beautiful. Beautiful beautiful. And if I say so myself,. for me and Courtney. Courtney Lou. It's time to cut the. strawberry and cream pie. Thank you for fixing the recipe. That was on the web. I appreciate it so much. I think it said to. leave this in the fridge for like six hours, you. know, to let it set. But. I think it's been about six hours now. All I got to do is find my pie scooper. So you can see why I said this would be a wonderful 4th of July dessert. I was lucky enough that. Theresa had some blueberries. And these beautiful strawberries,. it looks like a starburst. And let's just hopefully. That it tastes as good as it looks. These crusts can be hard. to cut all the way through. And remember how I told. y'all I cut the tinfoil to get that first piece. out a little easier? (Paula laughs) I think it's ready. How's that for a beautiful slice of pie? I'm gonna steal a blueberry or two. Red, white, and blue. God bless you. Really looks good doesn't it? The last layer on top is. the sweetened whipped cream. - Courtney Lou! It's delicious and I can't thank you enough, girl, for helping me. I need all my friends' eyes. on everything to help me. Mmm-mmm-mmm! I wanna go back and give. Michael a bite of this. He's gonna love it. So fresh. So summery tasting. And we made this without. turning on our oven. Which is great because when. it's 100 degrees outside the last thing I wanna. do is turn on my oven. So I send y'all a whole bunch. of love and best dishes. I think if you make. this for the 4th of July celebration nobody will be disappointed. So there you go. Love and best dishes, y'all.
