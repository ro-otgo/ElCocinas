[Music] Michael Anna in the last segment we just had the most wonderful meal we're gonna take Michael's wonderful coffee and guess what we're gonna make with it I can't wait one of your favorite things in the whole world we're gonna make cupcakes oh come on I can promise you this they're gonna be delicious so Michael if you'd start measuring up the wet ingredients I need 1 cup of strong black coffee that's cooled off I need a cup of vegetable oil measured out okay and over here I'm gonna start my dry ingredients and I'm gonna need 2 cups of sugar all right so there's our sugar and then I'm gonna add 2 and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour and these cupcakes are so easy to make I'm gonna add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt it's 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda a teaspoon of baking powder and I'm gonna need 3/4 a cup of cocoa and this is an unsweetened cocoa I'm using y'all and I'm just gonna whisk those dry ingredients together before we start adding our wet so you can just dump it right in there Michael all right so I'm gonna start my little electric mixer and Michael if you would start by adding the coffee okay and add the all and y'all this all is gonna make these cupcakes so delicious and moist coffees was doing that coffee is magically yeah all right now I'm gonna need for you to break 3 eggs into here we'll just add them one at the time okeydoke now you can put in the other one so see how easy those cupcakes were to mix up but now we got two more ingredients to add to it that's really gonna rich in this up we're gonna use 1 8 ounce carton of sour cream sour cream is wonderful you take batter y'all oh my goodness and then about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring well maybe that was a little bit more but that's alright alright so I'm just gonna incorporate that sour cream into a batter and Michael if you'd reach back there and get our muffin tins we'll start scooping this water we're gonna fill up our liners about two-thirds full this makes phony cupcakes now we're gonna put this in the oven Michael you can go ahead and do that and we're putting those in a 350 degree oven y'all and we're gonna bake them for about 16 to 18 minutes Michael I'm gonna put you a surprise in the center of these cupcakes after they come out of the oven I'm gonna use a three ounce package of cream cheese that softened to room temperature if you would measure me out 1/4 of a cup a coffee liqueur I'm gonna beat this real real good job cuz I don't want any lumps and it's gonna be very important that your cream cheese is at room temperature that's a pretty cool oh that's a pretty one it was a pretty cool Euler pretty cool ou're like color did you don't get that corny joke you're so cute and see I just make all your corny jokes or so funny you're probably the only listen that's why you liked me cuz I laughed at your funny joke so I'll just add this look cool just a little at a time and now I'm gonna fold in a chocolate flavored frozen topping like whipped cream yeah we're gonna use an 8 ounce container so we're just gonna take that and I'm not gonna beat it because I'm afraid that if we do too much beatin it could deflate it so I'm just gonna fold and then kind of mash until all that cream cheese is in there it's looking good in it stick your finger in there and tell me how you like it [Music] I think that's gonna be fabulous inside those cupcakes and you know what we're still not gonna be through with these cupcakes and we're not done with your coffee yet don't you go anywhere now for the fun part Michael and I have one last step to make our cupcakes complete you only taste one  all right we're ready to finish up those cupcakes that we started and Michael I need for you to measure me out three cups of confectioner's sugar please I've dumped a stick of softened butter into our bowl two three all right now I need for you to measure up about 1/4 of a cup of that strong cold coffee of yours you know it doesn't take much liquid or confectioner sugar so you want to add just a little bit at the time all right a little bit more there we go we don't want this too thin because it won't stay on our cupcake so I think we found got enough coffee in there like it so that was a little less and 1/4 of a cup of coffee that we pour it in here looker there wasn't that fast and easy yes alright we've got our cupcakes down here and I filled a pastry bag with our coffee flavored filling now for the fun part we're gonna take our piping bag and we're just gonna put our little needle down into that cupcake and we're gonna squeeze up about a tablespoon in there and I tell you what I'm gonna let you do that huh and you don't want to put your needle too deep because you don't want to break through the paper so we're just gonna frost our cupcakes now with that wonderful coffee flavored icing oh these look so good don't think you only taste one in just a second so I've got some chocolate covered coffee beans and I'm just gonna garnish our cupcakes with a few of those Michael mm-hmm it's time for you to taste let's see what we've got inside of there Oh doesn't that look good do you like it or do you love it those are delicious all right yummy I've
