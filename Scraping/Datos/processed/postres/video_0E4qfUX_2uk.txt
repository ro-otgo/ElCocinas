yo my teammates are killing me everybody's patience might be getting short until recent Eddie there they look like those ready have a catfight Barney well it was funny yellow playing but it was still funny y'all made me laugh so in 1989 when I started the bag lady everyday I made a special dessert that appeared to be everybody's favorite and that was gooey butter cakes well I made those gooey butter cake every day we started on June the 19th I made vanilla gooey butter cakes every day and when October the 1st came around I said y'all hear those funny noises it's not anybody breaking wind it's it's Teresa over here using a turkey baster make in those sounds I'm beat I'm pregnant I'll cut them for the next one well it sounds like you'll be doing something else so anyway when October came around y'all I said if I don't change these gooey butter cakes up I'm gonna scream so it was October it was time to start cooking with pumpkins so I formulated it to make the pumpkins butter cake and I promise you that has been one of the country's babies break sweet day - yeah sweet potato oh my gosh it's so good so I'm gonna show y'all how I made that very first gooey butter cake on June the 19th 1989 and we're gonna start with just a yellow cake mix or white you've got white that's fine alright I'm going to add 1 egg and 1 stick of milky splutter and this is gonna be the base now I just take my mixer and it's gonna be real but I just take my mixer and I mix it the best I can to it kind of all gets moistened just like this oh yeah it's doing good so over the years I swear I bet between me and my team over the years have probably formulated I bet 50 or 75 different ways to make gooey butter cake I am not kidding you because we get tired of making the same old warning all right now it's just swinging that dough out of there Oh cuz we get tired and we want to do something new so we had fun and I'm hoping that you have fun with it too this is just the very face stick but you know what after all these years it might still be my favorite one I'm gonna spray that just a little bit just ensure but this is not so much buttering I probably won't have to worry about it sticking but just out of habit all right something take my hands and just spread this out is evenly as I can and up the sides a little bit oh my gosh does this bring back Oh out of memories that bag lady it was a phenomenal little business it gave my sons and myself wings which was just wonderful only in America all right so I got my base spread out right right nice and easy easy even just like that all right so now as we'll make the custard Park and I'm gonna start with an 8 ounce package of cream cheese and let's see that's my melted butter so I think I'm just gonna whip this purse you get kind of fluffy come on swingin bring cheese all over the place all right I'm gonna lower that so it'll just barely missed it all right I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla I'm gonna add two eggs once in a while extent to which gooey butter cake I'm making but once in a while like the pumpkin gooey butter take I'll add three eggs at this point but only two is is really necessary all right now I'm gonna add two cups of powdered sugar and that's where we gonna get our stone all right number one slowly add that butter cuz I know I know you probably weighed all of 128 fine yeah big use a mouse I wouldn't mean to come out in public class her know everybody loves it and this has become our signature and people know when they come into Paula Deen family kitchen or or the lady in sons or Creek house they know that they're gonna be all first do we better catch all right so I'm just don't beat that a little bit more to get the long side of it [Applause] [Applause] and you notice I didn't mean wash my bowl or the beaters because it's all going in the same pot so you know you have to stop and watch alright I am going to do [Music] oh I just love nuts and smashed up you can see demand but you don't have to have them it's all about what you like what's your tongue like okay Michael I'm putting nuts silly buoys I guess that's why we get along we both like nuts all right so I'm gonna pour this on I don't know y'all heard him but he said that was one reason for his strong attraction to me was he liked newest go back to cooking your meat he's cooking up a Boston but on his grill out there all right Michael's favorite gooey butter cake I don't know if I've ever talked about this but his favorite is banana doing butter cake I make it just like this I'm a mash up you know how big the bananas are a couple of bananas just squish it up you know put it in the feeling here is the most important part now about this recipe it's super simple you can't mess it up until you go to cook it and I know the name of this is gooey butter cake but it's really not a cake when you're baking a cake you want it to be done when you stick up a toothpick in the center you want it to come out clean well this is not Oh tell my grandchildren and Michelle are doing they boys come over you can get them in can you get the door shut boy I love y'all so much look at immunity I could kiss y'all heads off so we still honoring the quarantine around here y'all they're gonna stay six feet away from each other trying that may be hard for a but Michelle this wanting to make sure that her daddy and I stay safe and we're not exposed to anything so all right so back to the cooking of this you really don't have to watch it because you know your oven unless you've calibrated your oven by putting up the monitor in there and set it to 350 and then checking your thermometer to see where where it measures up to but anyway we're gonna cook this for 40 to 50 minutes but when you at the end of 40 minutes you want to do your pan like this and you want it to jiggle just a little bit there in the center so don't overcook it because you want the G so okay 40 minutes actually I'm gonna look at it 35 I'm sorry I couldn't wait for y'all I had to go ahead and start tasting it I love a good butter cake mmm I'll cook this for 40 minutes y'all mmm oh I meant Dania if you don't want to fool with making it from scratch you can find these at where Paula Deen Stowell Paula Deen calm if you want a little help from your friends mmm and if you come up with a different one let me know I'm nuts my goose
