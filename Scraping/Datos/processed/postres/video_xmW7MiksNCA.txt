[Music] I've got one more thing to put together real quickly and that's Michaels white chocolate cherry chunkies we're gonna start by creaming one stick of butter with one cup of packed brown sugar and that's a light brown sugar and a cup of granulated sugar now we're just gonna let this stand we're going to cream that and that won't take long and we're gonna have cookies in the oven before you can say Jack Sprat I'm gonna add two eggs one at the time alright now I'm gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla to our batter and while that's beating we've got an all-purpose flour and I've got a half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then our batter will be ready for us to add it to that alright so we're gonna stick a couple of tablespoons of milk and and now we're gonna add our flour like I said this is gonna be a real stiff batter so I'm gonna do it just a little bit at the time I don't want to shock that batter by dumping the whole bowl of flour into it you can hear the mixer starting to labor now because we've gotten all of our flour in there and it is stiff okay I'm gonna add white chocolate and macadamia nuts and candied cherries so you could really mix this up and come up with two or three different kinds of cookies for this one batter all right you can see how stiff it is I'm gonna mix it around a little bit with the spatula and now I'm going in for the kill I'm gonna do it with my fingers and this is a job the children will love to help you with I'm gonna put these on my greased cookie sheet and I'm gonna do rounded tablespoons of batter and I mean I'm really gonna round them up because no Chansey cookies at our house we want nice fat cookies the most important thing is that you want all your cookies the same size because you want them to cook uniformly and all take the same amount of time all right now we're gonna put these in our preheated 375 degree oven and I can't hardly wait to taste one we're gonna let them bake for about 12 minutes and in the meantime I'm gonna be training up some more trays so I can get them in and out of the oven quickly all right in with that pan and out with the other pan now that's been 12 minutes I want to get these off that cookie sheet because like I said if you don't get them off pretty quickly they can sometimes stick on you now I want to give you one more hint about cookie baking you never want to put your cookie dough on a hot cookie sheet so you'll want to or three sheets so you can always start off with a cold sheet in the oven I think they're cool enough for me to have a little bite mmm wonderful [Music]
