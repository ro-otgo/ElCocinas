first up for all you sweet tooth lovers is our chocolate explosion cheesecake doesn't that look delicious look at this y'all and then stan makes one of his favorites a chocolate almond brickle brown

cream puffs you know there's always room for chocolate stan is the man here in town he is a dear dear friend and i love him to death he owns savannah candy kitchens here in town so for all you chocolate lovers this show is for you we are gonna make a chocolate explosion cheesecake today y'all and it's gonna take the entire show for us to put this cheesecake together stand because it's a dad gum many layers to it i don't care if it takes all day like if we eat some at the end stan is chopping some almond shell he's getting ready to make almond bread not brittle brickell brickle what's the difference between breakfast i believe it's a lot softer i didn't realize the difference between brickell and brittle y'all but i'm gonna start putting our cheesecake together now i have dropped in six tablespoons of butter to my double boiler here i'm gonna add two eggs six ounces of chocolate a half a cup of sugar two tablespoons of flour and we're just gonna just cook this on top of the the stove over the boiling water just till the chocolate melts y'all then we're gonna put it on our graham cracker crust and you can go on foodnetwork.com if you need the recipe for the graham cracker crust look at that butter popping it up butter makes it better immediately yes immediately all right so this is looking good [Music] all right if you'll pass me that crust i think everything is melted in here i'm going to turn this uh off and i'm just going to pour this in no you you got many nuts to chop so i'm just gonna pour this in here we're gonna put this in a 300 degree oven y'all and we're gonna bake it for 15 minutes and then we're going to pull it out and we're going to put another layer on top of this layer this is truly just the beginning and i'm just going to spread that out okay i'm going to have a caramel layer and another chocolate layer all right so in the oven this goes 15 minutes 300 degrees stand all right stan let's get started on your chocolate almond brickle so i'm gonna move this pot stand and we can move your brickel pot up and you tell me what to do what we want to do first we want to add two sticks of butter right there see i knew i loved staying they're on medium heat okay we're gonna get that melted we need a cup and a half brown sugar and we wanted to cook this to about 280 degrees but we want to stir it the entire time but not over stir it okay because if you over stir it it'll give it too much air in it and we don't want that either we want it to be firm but not brittley and there's a difference between brickell and brittle litany yes and i really believe it's the temperature brittle is cooked to 300 to 310 brick call is around 280. okay uh stan there's nothing more important than a thermometer candy making bacon it's all a formula i don't really think you can take a chance on that and candy making bacon it will a degree will really make a huge difference yeah now while we why i'm doing this paula let me get this almonds on the tray okay if i drop these on the floor that's gonna be bad well we'll just pick our nuts up off the floor and keep getting it it wouldn't be the first time i have dropped this on the floor you see that how that looks almost like the praline it sure does what's that thermometer now i don't know i'm gonna have to turn around here to me all right it's almost up to 270. i would say it's at 266. you sure that mm-hmm so you ready to take it out okay because if it gets over that it will get too hard for you okay so you're just gonna pour that for the nuts okay oh my gosh now we'll spread it evenly okay let it sit for about five minutes then we can add our chocolate our morsels and we're using milk chocolate today you want me to just sprinkle this on evenly this has got to melt so we got to put it on the chocolate chip i want to make sure you're not short on that yeah and you can change this you could do a cup and a half cup and a quarter yeah i might even like two cups if i but you know you can go with what you like you can make the thickness i got about two cups here so i don't think that hurts rules and recipes are made to be broken well they're made to fit your taste buds if you like a little more chocolate what's that going to happen look i'm just going to kind of bang that in there but we still got to get the thickness like we want it because the taste is not going to change but we want it to look pretty tupac oh okay look at this see there and we put those chocolate chips on it y'all while that that brickle was still hot it's correct mountain oh my gosh it looks delicious all right we're gonna put this in the refrigerator for 20 minutes i better do that okay while you're doing that i'm gonna wash my hands y'all go to your kitchen get your cup of coffee and come back sit down put your feet up because we've got the chocolate doctor here with us today stan the candy man coming up next it's time we sink our teeth into stan's brickell and then it's on to the next few
