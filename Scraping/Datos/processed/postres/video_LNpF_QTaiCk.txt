[Music] down south every party we have you can usually find a lemon bar is the recipe has been around for a hundred years and they're so delicious so I'm going to start this lemon dish with all-purpose flour confectioner sugar and a stick of butter and with my fork I'm just going to blend that butter into our dry ingredients and then I'm going to Pat it into our pan and we're going to bake this for about 15 or 20 minutes all right now I've got all this mixed up I'm gonna finish it off with my hands just make sure that our butter is all mixed in now I'm going to put mine into a pan and I don't I don't think I'm going to spray it because there's so much butter in this piece of pastry plus I've got a nonstick pan all right so I'm just going to press this down in here and make sure I level it off good and I bring it up the sides of the pan just a little bit so when I go to put my lemon filling in it you know kind of has something to wrap its arms around alright so I'm going to throw this in the oven and let it bake for fifteen or twenty minutes and when we come back I'm going to show you that luscious tart filling that goes in the center and also honey bars so I'll see y'all back in a few minutes [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay I don't know about y'all but I'm ready to finish up these lemon bars because I can't wait to get in them all right now I've got my crust here it's baked for about 15 or 20 minutes I pulled it out and we're going to add sugar a little flour because this is going to be kind of a loose center but we want just enough flour to bind it and we've got lemon juice and two eggs just going to give those a quick beat and then pour them in there and mix that together just like that I love making these because you don't have to pull out a mixer so we're just going to pour that on top and we're going on this back in the oven and while these are baking I'm going to come over here and show you a glazed honey bar and they're so good so let's throw this only in the oven and we'll let that bacon we'll move on over here now this is a dessert that I used to serve on the bag lady and I'm going to start with a self rising flour a teaspoon of cinnamon 2/3 of a cup of all an eighth of a cup of honey pulled-sugar in fact it's a half a cup of sugar and one egg I'm going to just give these a quick mix and then I'm going to pour in 1/2 a cup of nuts and we're going to run this in the oven bake it in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 25 to 30 minutes I'm going to give our pan a quick spray whoops was almost about to forget my nuts I'm in such a hurry so that's 1/2 a cup of walnuts I love walnuts in this so we're just going to pour this in here pop that in the oven so I want to show you how I finish them off and these are completely cooled this is the lemon bars now all I do to these is just dust them with powdered sugar all right and for my glazed honey bars I'm going to make a very thin glaze using a little powdered sugar and one of my favorite condiments in the whole world a tablespoon of mayonnaise and a tablespoon of milk teaspoon of vanilla I'm just going to give that a quick little mix and just pour that over a honey bars these are out of this world so once you say we cut them and I'm going to cut these in fairly small low bite size squares so that people feel like they have room for both you can see how they're kind of hard for me to cut because of the chewiness of them oh yeah and they're just popping right out of my pan because it's one of those nonstick type pans they're going to just love them alright you can see the way these are cutting they have a much softer texture to them you can kind of see that lemon custard kind of oozing out of them let's see how those are going to do Oh YUM see that cleaner I love the corners of a bar type cookie where they're really crispy and crunchy I think I'm going to put maybe a little lemon wheel just on the plate some fresh mint and some grapes just a little bit green for color and how pretty do those look I think maybe just a clump of grapes right there look how pretty that looks mmm oh my goodness maybe my cooking will make up for my goofiness that embarrasses Jamie sometimes [Music]
