everything to be perfect i heard about this girl named lisa that supposedly makes spectacular cakes and i'm gonna go see her and just see if she will share with us a few of her trade secrets and i really would like for you all to come along with me so let's go let's get going [Music] hey hi there how are you i'm looking for lisa i am i'm paula dean it's very nice to meet you jerry nice to meet you paul i'm glad you found us i'm i'm just popping in unexpectedly on you we love unexpected visitors i'm having a birthday party okay at my house and i just wanted to come by and see if you could give me a few tips on cake making i would love to we'll do a nice little cake for you for today what are you making here this is a italian meringue buttercream icing that i'm going to apply to the base of this cake and i'll show you how easy this is done this is a little cake turntable that i'm using and i'm spreading the icing as i'm turning the cake on the turntable and it's kind of a nifty little thing to use to make sure i get a nice smooth outer coating on the cake itself so it looks a little bit rough now you can see that but i'm going to show you a secret that's what i want to know this is very very hot water and i'm going to run my spatula under that hot water and being that we've got our icing that's made with butter if you take a look here it's going to melt the icing just enough ever so slightly as i run the spatula around to make it perfectly perfectly smooth i wondered how y'all got it now you know my secret now that looks much better than when we first started lisa then went on to show me a few of our other decorating secrets like these adorable little sugar doe dots and stripes that really spruce up any cake but you know hands down my favorite was lisa's beautiful edible roses one of the most popular types of flowers is an icing flower which is made with icing of course buttercream icing you can use royal icing as well and it's made with the pastry bag and this is called a rose tip and you can do different types of flowers with this rose tip most importantly of course is a rose and you make a little base with your icing and then you twirl it around and then you put on of course consecutive petals let's just make like a nice little rosebud and then we have this other nifty little tool that removes it from the cake and you can adhere it right to the edge of the cake lisa also showed me how to put on a fancy icing border that's not only beautiful but it also helps to hide the cracks and finally lisa gave me some of these real pretty little flower sprinkles to use at home but you know i really couldn't get over the beauty of lisa's cakes you're truly an artist thank you i'm so glad you came today it's just amazing we'll put it right in a box for you lisa i i can't thank you enough you've just made a special day even more special will you enjoy it thanks so much you're very welcome enjoy the rest of your day oh you too bye-bye now bye-bye [Music] wasn't that just amazing what we found at sweet lisa's i couldn't believe it i've got the cake here and i'm going to just tuck it away in the refrigerator and we'll open this up a little bit later i'm going to show you my son jamie's favorite birthday cake every time he has a birthday he says mama please make me my coconut cake and this is so easy it's a basic one two three four cake the reason it's called a one two three four cake is because it calls for one cup of butter two cups of sugar three cups of flour and four eggs so there's your one two three four so we're gonna start by creaming one cup of butter we're gonna add two cups of sugar [Music] and we're gonna add four eggs to this but we're gonna add them one at the time one more and the other and there goes the last one all right now we're going to start by adding our self-rising flour and our coconut milk so here we go and last i'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla and you're ready to load your batter into your cake pans now i like to use a little container with a handle on it like this and i'll start with one cup one cup for your next one and so on and so on until you've got them all filled and i'm going to take the spatula and just work the batter out to the edges i'm going to pick them up and drop them and it's going to bring the air from the cake to the surface and you can see the air bubbles coming up and it'll just give us a little bit more level cake these are ready to go in the 350 degree oven all right those are safely in the oven i'm going to cook them for about 25 minutes but in the other oven i have some that should be about ready and they are you can see that they've started pulling away from the pan which lets me know that they're ready they look just delicious when we come back i'm gonna show you how to turn those cake layers into a mouth-watering coconut cake [Music] we're back and i've just cut a few strips of wax paper right here and in a few minutes i'm going to show you what i'm going to do with them but in the meantime i'm going to show you how to make the most delectable filling for this cake we're going to start with sugar sour cream coconut and a little milk all right we're ready to start stacking now so we're just gonna flip that out like that thank goodness it came out nice and we're gonna take our wax paper now and just slip it a little under the edge of our cake and this will help keep our plate clean now we're going to take that cake layer and i like using a wooden spoon i like about this size i like for my holes to be really big so it can seep down in there you can use a a fork or a toothpick but i found the bigger the hole the better the cake then we're going to take our filling and just spoon it look at it you can see it running down into those holes moistening that layer from top to bottom there we go and on this layer we're going to start with our toothpicks so you'll have to alert your guests to be on the lookout for toothpicks because you don't want your cake to look like the leaning tower we're gonna do the same thing all over again and another layer of filling all right we're ready for the final layer now now the secret to this cake is letting that cake marinate in the refrigerator for three days and hope nobody's gonna touch it and you know i was prepared so i have one right here that's been in there just drinking up that filling you can see by this it's not a beauty but we're going to fix that because we're fixing to make a divinity icing that we're going to cover this cake in and you won't believe the transformation it's going to be like putting on our makeup and this is so simple to make we're going to start with egg whites sugar pinch of salt about a fourth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar plain old water so we're gonna beat this for one minute so that's been about a minute and at this point we're going to use the double boiler method and we're going to sit this bowl on top of rapidly boiling water and i'm gonna set my timer for seven minutes and we're gonna beat this okay our seven minutes is up i heard our timer go off and now i'm just gonna add a little bit of vanilla to it and i'm just gonna gently stir that in with a spatula and we're going to start by putting some up on the edge and then we're going to bring it slowly bring it down we're going to make sure that frosting goes all the way to the bottom and covers up every crumb of our cake kinda looks like marshmallow heaven all right now we're just going to bring that icing on up to the top there's only one thing left to do and that's to put the coconut on the top kind of just press it in against your cake so when you get through you're gonna have a little frosting probably to lick off looks like a big snowball doesn't it this cake is ready so now we're just ever so gently gonna slip our wax paper out from underneath that layer and we have a clean plate what a great trick that is you know it's just great having two of everything that means i can taste this one here we go i'm in heaven so gummy the adults really love this cake and i can't have a party without making the kids something extra special too so we're fixing to make ice cream cone cakes so i'm gonna need y'all's help see you in a minute [Music] okay we're ready to get those ice cream cone cakes ready for the kids and you know i'm really not going to a whole bunch of trouble because they're going to be eating them so fast and running and laughing and playing they're not gonna know that i didn't make them from scratch so all we're gonna do is start with our favorite cake mix three eggs [Music] now you can jazz these cake mixes up a little bit usually when i use a cake mix i'll add four eggs to just give it a little bit more fluff but for these ice cream cake cones it's gonna be just perfect this way but i am substituting the water for milk now there goes our oil and i do like to add about a teaspoon of vanilla okay i think it's been about four minutes now that should be ready so all we're gonna do at this point is fill up our little cones i'm going to fill those not quite full about two-thirds to three-quarters of the way full and these are ready to go in the oven and we'll start checking them about 10 minutes oh and i've got another batch right over here that should be about ready oh and those look good the batter kind of came out on some of them that's great and i've got some sitting right over here that's already cool they're cool enough for us to go ahead and frost and i'm gonna use a very quick icing today actually i've gone to a canned icing so i've got my pastry bag loaded with chocolate icing and i'm using a star tip so we're just going to pick these up and just start rolling our icing on and then when we get around here we're going to move on up top cone around just like this until we get a nice little curly top on it some kids like chocolate and some kids like vanilla so we're going to do some of each we're gonna try to please the whole gang okay i've got two of these frosted and i'm gonna put some of these wonderful little sugared flowers that lisa gave me and i'm going to want to put them on there before the frosting hardens it won't take me any time to decorate these and when i get through i'm gonna come back and share a few more baking tips with you and then we gonna have a party [Music] [Music] ice cream you scream we all scream for ice cream and i don't know of a soul that doesn't love those ice cream cone cakes and when you go to dip it up another great topping is toasted coconut it's so delicious and when you're ready to tote those cones out to the children at the party if you have an old ornament box from christmas it works great to tote your cones in i think i finally got everything ready for the birthday party this magnificent cake that lisa gave me is out of this world and jamie's favorite coconut cake and these adorable little ice cream cones for the kids in fact speaking of kids i hear them now so i'm gonna have to run [Music] hey kids kids y'all ready who's ready for ice cream chum cakes come on all right now
