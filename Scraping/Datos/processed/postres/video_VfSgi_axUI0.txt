hey everybody i'm paula deen and i hope you have room in your recipe box because today we're making cookies my magnolia lace trumpets are truly one of the prettiest things you've ever eaten all my friends tell me that my savannah bow ties with chocolate dipping sauce are the first things to go when they make them for bake sales and i'll lay it on thick with my loaded oatmeal cookies with brown butter icing so get out your tins and call your friends cookies need a crowd i'm getting ready to go to a cookie swap but i have a little problem i got an empty cookie jar and i've got to fill it but before i can do that there's about two gadgets that i need to go pick up so we can make these cookies come out quick and easy and perfect so y'all hang with me cause we got cookies to bake [Music] good morning good morning how are y'all doing i'm getting ready to bake cookies maybe you can help show me some things that would make the job a little bit easier what do you recommend we've got our traditional professional baker's pen they're really hard to beat aren't they they are anything else i can use yes i think i would actually like to invest in some type of form something like a little column little bit exactly okay she said i'm making her trumpet shaped oh i have just the thing okay okay for that you can wrap the cookie right around that real quick nice and tapered that is pretty i can't wait to use them thank you very much and come again and if you need anything else give a yell oh i appreciate it thank you thank you bye what a great shop that was i could have spent half the day there kathy had so many great things and as usual i overspent but there was a couple of things that i couldn't resist but the first cookie we're going to start with is the magnolia lace trumpets so we're going to start with a stick of butter and a half a cup of sugar and i'm going to add about a third of a cup of dark corn syrup when we get through with them they're going to look like little rounds of lace i'm going to turn that off and we're going to take our flour and we're going to add a half a teaspoon of ginger toss that around into the flour and then we're just dumping it right in there and we're just going to stir them up until all the flour is incorporated in there the last thing that i'm going to add though is one tablespoon of bailey's irish cream oh i love that stuff and you could certainly use different liqueurs now i've really got something that i want to show you that i think you'll love and it's called a silpat it's made of silicone and they're just fabulous for cookie bacon they're a little on the pricey side but i think you'll love it if you locate them now to scoop up our batter onto our cookie sheet i'm going to use a one teaspoon measuring spoon and a small offset spatula and this is going to spread i know it doesn't look like much batter but you're going to be amazed at at how big this cookie actually gets we're not going to do but three at the time because they'll get crisp and hard and then we won't be able to roll them we're gonna put this into a 350 degree oven uh and bake it for about eight or eight and a half minutes you'll really have to watch these because your oven may vary a little bit from mine but i've found that eight and a half minutes is just about perfect and while those are baking i'm gonna make the cream that goes inside of them which really makes this cookie just melt in your mouth and uh we're gonna start with some crisco that sounds yummy already doesn't it good southern cookie crisco and butter all right that's mixed up and now i'm gonna heat our milk i'm gonna get it just nice and hot and in the meantime i'm going to come back over here and add our sugar and cream that together very well and i'm going to add one egg white [Music] this is coming together nicely now i'm gonna add our hot milk one tablespoon at the time now all i have to do is add one teaspoon of vanilla and we're ready to fill now let's see if our cookies are ready all right these look like they're ready that was just about perfect timing for us now this is when we have to work very very quickly they're just still a little bit warm at this point to work with i'm so excited about this little form all right now i'm just going to turn that over because i really want the lacy part to be on the outside of the cookie and all we do is slip that out and we've got our trumpet look how easy that kong made this that's just a perfect trumpet now while those are getting cool for us we're gonna come over here and take our piping bag and i'm gonna fill this these cookies are so pretty when you're finished and i'm just gonna put the bag down in there and start filling how beautiful is that magnolia lace trumpets i've just got to have a taste oh i promise you this one's going to be the first one gone y'all stick around because i'm fixing to show you some neat savannah bow ties with a chocolate dipping sauce [Music] [Music] the next cookie we're fixing to make is called savannah bow ties and every cookie i make i'll you'll see me taste it and say oh that's my favorite that's my favorite that one no that one's my favorite i love this cookie we're just gonna start with about a half a cup of almond paste this is a product that's more on the hard side i'm going to help it along just by slicing it up kind of give him a little head start on getting beaten and we're going to use one egg yolk and we're gonna actually use this white in just a few minutes when we're finishing up our cookies so nothing's gonna go to waste that's the way i like it now i'm going to add brown sugar and milk now we're going to take our board and lightly dust it because we don't want this sticking and then we're going to move our puff pastry over here you can buy this in the frozen food section of your grocery store and it's so easy to work with and we're going to roll it out to approximately 14 inches i've even got a tape measure here so that i can kind of gauge it as we go you know you this dish is just hard to mess up when you're using a good product like the puff pastry it's just fabulous and this is what we're going to use on our savannah bow ties now we're going to cut our puff pastry in the middle just like that and now we're going to put that almond filling on one side of this puff pastry now there's several different ways that you can do this i like to periodically drop some and like i said this is really the hardest part of this whole cookie recipe but it's gonna make you look like you're a first-rate pastry chef i made these cookies for michael he loves them in fact i sometimes wonder if that's why he asked me to marry him because he knew he'd have his own personal little cookie baker so what i'm gonna do is get a piece of wax paper and some nonstick spray and we're going to pat it down that way i don't know what i'd do without this spray comes in so handy so see how it just goes together just like that i think i'm even going to try this let's see how that works we just found a new trick that's great see you just learn something new every time you cook all right now we're just gonna fit one sheet on top of the other just like that so we're going to cut 14 one inch strips with our wheel see those pretty edges and then we're going to come back and we're going to cut them directly in half just like that then we're going to gently pull them apart then we're going to pick up our cookie we're going to give it two twists and you got yourself a savannah bow tie i'm placing these on a cookie sheet with tinfoil i did not spray it because there's so much butter in puff pastry that you're not gonna have to worry about it sticking the next step is to beat that egg white remember that egg white that we had left over from the almond filling but we're gonna beat that now we're gonna take a little pastry brush and just paint these and that egg wash is gonna give them a pretty shiny coat i think on these i'm to sprinkle a little coarse sugar on them see how simple those are to make and they're just going to be spectacular now we're going to put these in the oven and we're going to let them bake for about 12 to 15 minutes so they'll be ready in no time and while those are cooking i'm gonna show you what makes these cookies so grand all right i've got sugar half a teaspoon of salt and some cornstarch and we're going to break up our chocolate into our pot and we're going to add our cream and we've got one egg yolk that we're gonna temper into our pot tempering means heat slowly if we didn't temper that yolk into there it could very well turn out like a scrambled egg in there and we don't want scrambled eggs and chocolate and i'm gonna beat up this yolk just slightly using a fork and i'm gonna add a little bit of the warm chocolate to that and i'm gonna keep on until i've got it to about a half a cup and stir it back into the chocolate and it's getting thick on it so now it's time to cut off the fire and i'm going to add a little bit of vanilla flavoring to it we actually got like a hot fudge sauce we're getting very close our savannah bow ties look so good look at them and i promised you they wouldn't stick on the tinfoil because of the butter that's in the puff pastry have you ever seen such a decadent cookie i think it's time for a taste i know that's why he asked me to marry him y'all stick around we're gonna make paula's loaded oatmeal cookies yum with a brown butter icing [Music] well is everybody ready to make my loaded oatmeal cookies this is so so simple don't let all these ingredients up here scare you because it's very very simple and easy we're going to take flour we're going to see how good i am cloves cinnamon allspice ginger the fourth half teaspoon of nutmeg baking soda baking powder and a little salt that was very simple even though it looked like a lot of ingredients so we're just going to sift those together with our all-purpose flour so that's all we're going to do there we're going to move on over here and we're going to start creaming our shortening with our butter love me a little crisco in with my butter and we're just going to cream those together the next thing we're going to do is add our brown sugar so we're going to prime our brown sugar into our butter and crisco now we're going to add one egg all right now we're gonna just beat in our flour and the buttermilk beat it for a minute and then we're adding the last of our flour all right the buttermilk's worked in there and here goes the last we're going to add about a teaspoon of vanilla now all right the rest of the ingredients we're just gonna fold in by hand and that will be our oatmeal our nuts now i'm using a walnut and raisins nice fat plump raisins so we're just gonna fold this all up we've got our batter ready i'm gonna get our cookie sheets and this time i'm gonna use the parchment paper and we're just going to see how that works in comparison to the other that we used i'm going to give it a light spray i'm always grabbing pam arna and then i'm gonna drop it by the teaspoonful onto the paper now one thing about cookies the most important thing is that you make them all the same size all right these are ready to go into the oven and then we're going to be checking on them in about eight or nine minutes now while those are getting ready we're going to make our brown butter icing we're going to take a sis a stick of butter y'all act surprised and we're gonna melt that and we're actually gonna cook it until it's kind of a light brown now you'll want to be very very careful here because you know that butter will burn all right our butter is starting to brown a little bit you can see it foaming up and you can see it's starting to change colors on us all right now we're just gonna add the powdered sugar and mix that up together put in our vanilla flavoring all right now we're going to start adding our water you'll hear me say all the time you can always add two but you can't take out so we'll want to do a little at the time kind of beat that up and you can see it's just a nice light tan color let's check on the cookies and see what they look like they should be about ready oh they look so good all right we're ready to drizzle and if our consistency's not right we'll go back so you thought an oatmeal cookie couldn't get any better why don't we get them up off of that you can see how nice that that worked for us don't those look delicious i'm gonna go for this one that has the most brown butter icing on it whole new twist to the oatmeal cookie y'all go pour yourself a big glass of milk and come back cause i got some tips for you [Music] i want to just share with you a couple of quick tips that will make your cookies mouth-watering the first thing you'll always want to do is start with two trays so you can always drop your batter onto a cooled tray and talking about cute little totes this chinese takeout just makes the cutest little carryout and on those magnolia lace trumpets slip a little ribbon on them for a real real festive look how pretty is that if you should have a cookie swap to go to
