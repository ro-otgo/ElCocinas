[Music] you [Music] and these are really really easy to make not quite as easy as those but they're really easy to make the only thing that's gonna take time is your dough's gonna have to sit in the refrigerator all right today I've mixed up an all-purpose flour baking soda fresh ground nutmeg ground cinnamon ginger salt butter dark brown sugar eggs and last but not least a rich molasses and after I get all these properly folded in together I'm gonna get in there y'all and use my hands to form my dough into a ball and next I'm gonna wrap him in plastic wrap and throw him in the fridge for about an hour so I can set up that'll make you much much easier for us to roll out might as well go ahead and get my milk out while I'm in there and this dough is is nice and chilled and I'm just gonna break off a little piece of it and work a little bit at the time now you'll need some extra flour you want to make sure that you dust your rolling pin real good so that your dough won't stick to your PIN now I've got a tray of gingerbread men already started so we're just going to take our cookie cutter and you'll want to make sure that you run that through the flour so your dough won't stick to it as well and look at that the perfect little gingerbread now you can put these cookies closer together because they're not going to rise much because we've used an all-purpose flour all right so we're gonna put these in the oven and we're gonna bake these for about 10 minutes on 350 degrees now your leftover dough you can take it and just reroll it so we won't have almost any waste at all so in we go hey Remy and I've got a pan ready here and you can see how they've hardly risen at all there's still about the same size that they were we're gonna come over here and decorate our gingerbread men and women so I'm gonna start with some powdered sugar and you'll want to be very very careful that you don't add too much milk oops I'm making a mess because a little milk and confectioner sugar goes a long way so be very very careful during this step and just add a little bit at the time until you get it right because you can always add too but you can't take it out all right now we're gonna separate this into three different batches all right we're gonna color one of them green now you can use your favorite color for your gingerbread cookies all right and in our next Bowl we're gonna give him some red food coloring and we don't need a whole bunch all right just gonna spoon him into the bottom of the bag and then I'm gonna come over here to the corner and I'm gonna put the tiniest tiniest hole in fact I'm probably gonna need my eyeballs for this one because we don't want to make that hole very big at all one more time it's just that simple all right one more little snip all right we're ready to decorate and the reason I left some white y'all it's because I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna I'm gonna make a gingerbread Paula with white hair and then I'm gonna make a gingerbread Michael with just a tough I higher okay cuz you know Michaels a losing his air so I love it okay now we're gonna give Michael a t-shirt well right now he's naked from the waist down but we're gonna fix that I think I'll give him some white shorts he loves his shorts all right let's give him he's real hairy so let's give him some hair coming out of his shirt and there's his eyes and he's got a big o smile but you can't see it first mustache perfect all right let's make him green-eyed I love it all right now I'm gonna I'm gonna make me a pretty pink dress mm-hmm so how fun is that hmm I can't get over how much it looks just like Michael and kind of resembles me too y'all are gonna have so much fun doing family portraits but the main thing is you're gonna be in the kitchen with your family having fun cuz that's what it's all about [Music]
