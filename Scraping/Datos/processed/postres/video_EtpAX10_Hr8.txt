Sybil Barnett all right so I'm gonna add that one egg at the time get out of there all right one more egg I love making cakes then I can use my little hand mixer with they seem a lot less intimidating and a lot easier to throw them together when I don't have to pull out that big mixer all right now to this I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla and then I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna take one cup of all-purpose flour all right into that I'm gonna add about an eighth of a teaspoon of salt I'm gonna add one teaspoon of baking powder and I'm just gonna take this over here and I'm just gonna sift this over our Bowl now I'm just gonna beat that in I like this recipe but cause first off it's good it's really really good but it's really really simple too okay so in goes one 16 ounce can of chocolate syrup there comes the chocolate okay now I'm gonna get my spatula cuz I'm gonna get every bit of that chocolate out on there mmm so good okay now I have a 13 by 9 by 2 pan over here that I've greased and floured and I've got my oven preheated to 350 and I'm gonna bake this for about 25 or 30 minutes right now I'm gonna after I lick my finger mmm I'm gonna bounce my pan oh my kid owner cuz I don't want any holes in my cake okay so in the oven this goes 350 25 to 30 minutes I got the cake out of the oven 25 minutes it was done and now I'm gonna show you how miss Sibyl makes her chocolate frosting for it I'm gonna start with a stick of butter all right now I'm gonna add a cup of sugar and now I'm gonna add 1/3 of a cup of evaporated milk I'm using evaporated milk because it's not as thick as sweetened condensed milk all right so I'm gonna let this cook but a couple of minutes I'm gonna stir in and a half a cup semi-sweet chocolate chips it's gonna be delicious look at how smooth how good does that look okay so I'm gonna turn off the heat and you want to make sure that the vanilla it's the last thing you put in because you don't want that flavor to cook out I'm and a half a cup of chopped pecans y'all move in so you can see real good cause watch this chocolate all over the top of that cake how good and simple as that Joan I'm gonna let this cool for a second I'm gonna run to the bedroom I'm gonna change my shirt and I'll meet y'all in the backyard in a minute [Music]
