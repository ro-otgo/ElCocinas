- Hey, my dear friends. Come on into the kitchen with me. You know, I'd like to think of y'all as all being on a stool,. sitting around this counter, and we're having a soda, or a. cup of coffee, and laughing, and just enjoying one another's. company, exchanging stories. Well, I know that can never happen. Not all of us will fit around. that counter, to start with. But Eddie gave me a few, what would you call these? They're not letters, Eddie. - [Eddie] Comments. - Yeah, more of a comment than anything. And these were on my YouTube channel. And so, which brings me to... Thank y'all all so much for your support. And I hope I've been a little. bit of comfort to y'all that have maybe been quarantined and not around your family or your friends like you used to be. So that was certainly my goal for this little Quaran-Deen Cooking show. I don't even want to call it a show. It's more like, help me come up with a word. It's more like vignettes or something. I mean, some of the. recipes are really long, and some are real short,. just like a recipe is. But Eddie just brought. these three to my attention a few minutes ago. This is from Sweet Home, Alabama. "Paula, you need to do. a livestream one day "where you guys can talk with all of us." I would not begin to know. how to do that, Sweet Home. - [Eddie] We'll have to check into it. - But yes, Eddie and I will. check with our computer guru, Big Mike, that works on the property. Not Michael Gruver, but another. Mike that's part of our team that we couldn't do without. And then the next one is from Shane. Shane asks, "I love to watch these videos. "Don't think I've missed one yet." Well good, Shane. How long do they stay up? - [Eddie] Oh, they're up always. - They won't ever go- - [Theresa] Once they go up, they live. - Yay! So if you miss a day, you can. always go back and find it. (cackling) And this last one made me laugh because this is from Paul Nunya. And for y'all that don't. know what Nunya means, it means none ya business. (laughing) I hadn't heard that expression, Paul. - [Eddie] You should see, it would take me forever to type something the. way he typed something. It's a lot of detail. - He does. He's a detail man. "I seriously don't know. what I'd do without you." Well, Paul Nunya, that is so sweet. That is so sweet. And I hope it's nothing. that you have to worry about in the near future. I hope it's a long way off. that you have to worry about being without me, but that. just touches my heart. So I just wanted to take an opportunity, and you know, I'm always saying. Excuse me. Y'all send me one of. your favorite recipes, or tell me what your grandma. used to make for you. And believe it or not,. I get a lot of recipes. And I'm so appreciative of those because I love hearing y'all's stories. 'Cause you know, we all got a story, just some people don't. ever get to tell them. And I appreciate when. we can tell your story. All right, so the cake I'm making today is from Megan Frounfelter. F-R-O-U-N-F-E-L-T-E-R. Frounfelter. And listen, Megan was short. and sweet with her words. She said, "Hi, Miss Paul Deen. "My granny used to make a cake. called a pea-picking cake. "It was the best cake ever. "Was wondering if you have ever made it, "and if you would make one. on your Quaran-Deen Cooking. "Thank you so much, and be blessed." Well Megan, I have got a. recipe in one of my cookbooks, I can't even remember. which cookbook it is, but the name of mine is pig-picking cake, which is very close to pea-picking cake. Pea-picking came from Ernie, what was Ernie's last name? (snapping) From Hee Haw. He sang, what song was it? ♪ Takes a two-ton ♪ Oh, I can't remember, and. I can't sing to start with. Ernie. It's not Ernie Williams, is it? - [Theresa] I can't help you. - Ernie Ford. Was it Ernie Ford? Or was that a car? (laughing) Anyway. I'm gonna cut this oven down a little bit. So I'm sure that y'all can. probably tell by my clothes that either y'all are. thinking, "That damn woman "don't never change clothes." (laughing) "She has been wearing that for days now." Actually, when I come. in here in the kitchen and shoot these vignettes, and shows, I do about five or six in one day. So that's why you'll see me. for days in the same outfit Well, today just feels like. it's Grandmother's Day, so I'm so excited because. in an earlier vignette, I made another cake. that came from a granny. So this one is so simple, and I hadn't compared this recipe, Megan, with the one in my book,. but they would have to be, if not identical, they would. have to be very, very similar. So we're gonna start. with a yellow cake mix. And you know what? You really don't even. have to have a mixer, an electric mixer for this, but I'm gonna use one. just to beat up my oil. I think that was a half a cup of oil. Let's see what Megan said. This is a real moist cake, y'all. Yeah, half a cup of oil. So I'm gonna just use. my little hand mixer. Make sure I get this mixed up real good, but like I said, I could. certainly do this with a whisk, and do it by hand. (mixer rattling) But I wanna make sure. it's mixed up real good. And our last ingredient that's. gonna go in this, y'all, is Mandarin orange. Mandarin oranges. And Megan tells us to only. pour off half of the juice. So that's what we've done. And because these beaters. would just tear the heck out of those little. fragile orange sections, I'm gonna just fold them in. After I get this mixed up real well. (mixer slows) There we go. So just gonna fold that right in. Because see, the only... We didn't have any milk, or buttermilk, or water to make that cake with. So we really needed that. liquid from the oranges. And I do want y'all to. be able to see these when you cut into your cake. Beautiful. So that's it. All right. Megan said put it in three pans. She didn't tell me. which size, or anything, so usually I make a nine-inch cake. But these eight-inch pans were so handy, I said, "I'm just gonna. make it an eight-inch pan." So I always use my measuring spoons to try to get my cakes perfectly even. So if I measure the batter, then I know they're all. gonna be the same size. Those orange pieces look pretty. in there, don't they, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - See, just stirring those little oranges wants to break them down. - [Eddie] You said you have. made something like this? - [Paula] Oh yeah. But like I said, we'd. have to, oh, start there. That one's got a lot of oranges in it. - [Eddie] Do the oranges. dry out as they cook? - Eddie, I don't remember. I don't even know if I. used Mandarin oranges. I don't remember. (chuckling) All right. I hope those are pretty close to even. You know, when we get done, I don't think any of my. cookbooks are down here. So we'll just have to go on the computer and pull up. Paula Deen's Pig-Picking Cake and see how much alike they really are. Because like I said, they. could be straight identical. I don't know. But, I sure do appreciate you sending in your version, Megan, 'cause there's always. another way to do everything. This one, this pan looks. a little lighter to me. But you know what? I'm not gonna worry about it. I'm gonna put these in a 325 degree oven. No butt shots, Eddie. No butt shots! (laughing) - [Theresa] Paula, remember, it's 350, but for your oven it's 325. - No, for these, no. - [Theresa] Oh, oh, little ones. - I thought it said 325, Teresa. - [Theresa] Did it? (both laughing) I think you're right, now. that you're saying it, especially with that looking- - 325. - [Theresa] With those wonky eyeglasses, I'm gonna go with you. - Hey, listen, I do what I. have to do to be able to see. (laughing) Okay, Jennifer. Your pea-picking cakes. have cooled down nicely, so now it's time for us to. make the frosting for them. And this comes from Megan,. as I said early, Frounfelter. Frounfelter. (laughing) I'm sorry, Jennifer. I mean, Megan. I was just talking to Jennifer. So Megan says, now here's. where I did something a little different, Megan. It called for one nine-ounce. tube of whipped topping. Well, I personally don't care for the frozen whipped topping. It's great if you're. trying to cut calories or something like that. I mean, it's better than nothing if you're looking for. something that's sweet, But I whipped my own fresh cream, my whipping cream, and I mixed it. I think I probably used. maybe a cup and a half of whipping cream, and put in, oh gosh, maybe a quarter of a cup of sugar. So I sweetened it up because, you know, that frozen whipped is sweet. So that needed to be sweet, too. So, she tells us to add one small package of vanilla Jello. Now this is gonna make all this tighten up and stay on that cake. And it calls for one, let. me see if it says an ounce. Just one large can of. crushed pineapple, drained. And you wanna make sure. you drain it real good, because if it's too soupy,. it won't stay on your cake. We'll let Michael. So we just gonna stir all that together. - [Theresa] It's interesting. how Michael always comes around when he sweets are coming out of the- - [Paula] When it's cakes. - Yeah.. (Paula laughing) Do you have a sense? Something speaks to you from... (Paula laughing) - [Michael] Sweets for the sweet. - [Theresa] Hey. - Right. (laughing) You know what I may do, y'all? Megan just said frost the cake. But you know what? It might be easier, and I. like lots of frosting, y'all. Now I'm gonna put a drop. of frosting right there, so that kinda glue my first cake down and not let it slide around. Isn't that beautiful? Remember we used that. can of Mandarin oranges. So this is what I may be thinking, y'all, 'cause like I said, I like a lotta icing. And I think it would be right prudent. Oh. (utensils clattering) You ever done that, Michael? Gone to slam that door,. and a knife be sticking up? - [Michael] Yup. (telephone ringing) - I know that's a sales call, don't y'all? - [Michael] Might be. your last chance, Eddie. - Last chance for that warranty. Oh no. Hello. (buzzer sounding) (dog barking) Hello. (dog barking) That was the gate. (chuckling) (voice drowned out) With you, Mikey? Ooh, and look at that. Mm mm, I shoulda sprayed that waxed paper. All right. See how that pudding got. that whipping cream so thick? On this. I can't stand it if I. don't have enough icing, so I'm wondering if may be I. could just get away with... - [Theresa] Doing the filling? - [Paula] Doing the sides. - [Theresa] And not the top? - [Paula] I meant the top. - [Theresa] Yeah. I would just do fillings. - [Paula] Yeah, cause I. like a lot of in-between. - [Theresa] And I was. gonna say, that wasn't... The tub wouldn't have given you any more than what you're doing right now. - [Paula] No, no, I don't think so. - [Theresa] So you really. coulda doubled this recipe in order to cover the whole cake. - [Paula] I could have,. yes, to just make sure. Like I said, to me,. the best part of a cake is having plenty of good old icing. - [Theresa] I'm with you. Especially when it's whipped cream. - Yes. And this cake is so pretty. with those oranges showing. (dog continues barking) You know, I'm not offended by this at all. Oops. Okay. Tastes pretty good, y'all. That's a big cake. (cackling) I love your pea-picking cake. Oh yeah. (chuckling) I always get nervous if my icing looks like it's running low. I have had to stop in the. middle of making a cake and make more icing. - [Michael] You need a tester for that? - [Paula] I do need a tester. (Theresa laughing) - [Theresa] Like we said,. it's amazing how you show up. - How does that look to you, Eddie? - [Eddie] Looks great. - [Paula] You got that good eye. It doesn't look weird? - [Eddie] Mm mm. Looks like something you'd. pay a lot of money for in a restaurant for dessert. - Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Thank you, Megan. - [Theresa] Yeah, can. you decorate the sides? You can just put some oranges. or things on the side. It would be real pretty. - [Paula] Yeah. Oh Megan. - [Theresa] Do we get to cut into it? - [Paula] Yeah, we gonna cut it. We can't do that to. Megan and not taste it. - [Theresa] I don't think people. realize in real television you always have all the things made up, but we could never eat any of it because you had to save it for beauties. - [Paula] Had to save it, yes. - [Theresa] So it was just torture. - Yeah, all you could do was look at it. - [Michael] You might have. to steal a piece of cake, Paula, and put it back again. - [Paula] Yup. (laughing) - [Michael] You ever seen her do it? - [Theresa] Only she. could get away with that. - [Michael] Yeah, let's. see how she does it. That's the way you get it out. - [Theresa] Well, maybe we'll. show the viewing audience that one day, but that's not today's... - Well, she could do it. - It looks a little funny to me because I know that icing is. supposed to be on the side. But we won't know it when. it's going down our belly. So let's cut it! Who wants a piece? - [Michael] You talked me into it. - [Paula] Okay. You know this way, you. know how we always fight about the end of the cake? Well, it don't matter. - [Michael] I know. - When I frost it that way. You got 'em, Theresa? Just those little plates, yeah. - [Theresa] I'm just getting the plastic, I mean, the disposable ones. - Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. - [Theresa] One, two, three makes Eddie, and four makes me. - [Paula] Look. - [Theresa] Oh my God. - [Paula] Doesn't that look good? I coulda stood some more. icing right in there. Yes, Megan, the next. time I make this, honey, I'm doubling the icing. All right, there you go, husband. - [Michael] Well, thank you. - [Paula] You're welcome. - [Michael] (mumbling) - [Theresa] No, I do not. - Thereser? Uh oh. (laughing) - [Theresa] I shoulda. taken the first piece. - I was trying to do that. from the wrong angle. - [Theresa] It's okay. It all eats the same. - All right, Eddie. - [Theresa] Yum. It looks so moist. - It does, doesn't it? That's 'cause it called for oil. I love a cake that calls for oil. - [Theresa] You know. what I love about this is it's not overly sweet. - No, strangely, it's not, Theresa. - [Theresa] And the cream is good. I love Mandarin oranges. - All right, I'm gonna try to cut me off- - [Michael] I like healthy cakes. (Theresa laughing) - It's hard trying to cut a thin piece. - [Michael] Usually I like carrot cake 'cause I get my carrots. - Yes, you get your vegetables. - [Michael] Yeah. - That is one pretty cake. That top layer's got a lotta icing. - [Theresa] You need to taste it, 'cause it's one good tasting one, too. - Delicious. - You like it, Michael? - Mm hm. - Yay. Megan, thank you so, so much. - [Michael] Thank you, Megan. - And I will see you next time. Thank you for sharing. Whoa! - [Theresa] It's good. - [Paula] Mmm!
