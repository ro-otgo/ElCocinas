good morning y'all another uh quarantine cooking school going on this morning you know i've had so many um so many letters and requests from people to say paula please don't stop these when the quarantine is up uh because we just it just makes our day to have these to watch so you know what i think that's probably something that i can almost promise you that i'm i'm not gonna quit i'm not gonna quit doing them even after things get back to normal because i've had way too much fun i get so much correspondence from y'all and just hearing you talk in fact the recipe i'm gonna share today y'all uh a request came in from a couple out of bluffton south carolina which is just right over the talmadge bridge and it's from steve and mary ball and they sent me the sweetest card it was just so sweet and so encouraging and you know it just makes whatever work i do it just makes it worthwhile to hear uh that i've made somebody smile made them happy so that's great um so anyway they wanted to know if i would show everybody the recipe for grand girls fresh apple cake from georgia and if you like apples this is truly a wonderful cake and it's a cake where you don't even have to pull out the mixer and uh the recipe says to add all the ingredients in the order that they're given um just add those in the bowl so we're gonna start with sugar now there'll be a link where you can go online and find this recipe but um i'll try to tell you the measurements too as we go in case you're writing them down all right the first ingredient to go in is two cups of sugar three eggs how much y'all let's see what that says yes a cup and a half of vegetable oil this one's kind of hard to read isn't it eddie but it's a cup and a half and all those other numbers only i have no idea what they mean i found the biggest biggest picture yes it's great that like millimeters i don't know about those kind of words all right we got some orange juice and i think maybe a half a cup no it says a quarter of a cup that looks more than a quarter doesn't it let's just see it's a quarter of a cup how could i doubt uh eddie and teresa's measurements i don't think so all right then the next thing we're gonna do is add a flower but i'm going to incorporate this a little bit you know i just love making these kind of cakes that don't require a a big old mixer it just really makes it just a little easier and you're not gonna believe how good this cake is gonna taste and i love a cake made with oil if a recipe calls for all you can bet your bottom dollar that it's gonna be really moist all right so add our flour and i think it's three cups yes it's three cups of all-purpose flour and i think it's two teaspoons one teaspoon of baking soda soda soda that kind of stuck in there get all that out and let's see how much cinnamon one tablespoon of cinnamon and one tablespoon i think it looks like a tablespoon of vanilla yes it is okay so we're just gonna keep mixing this up and then we've got the apples to add to it and coconut and nuts my favorite nut a pecan this cake is it's kind of very very oops i forgot to the salt it wasn't in its right place let's see a fourth of a teaspoon of salt but i usually use in sweet recipes a little bit more salt uh than the recipe calls for because i just like that uh little sweet and kind of savory you know that you get see how easy that was y'all we we have just about got this thing ready to go into the oven and i've got our oven preheating at 325 and uh okay so it calls for three cups of peeled and chopped rather on the fine side of apples and i can't remember what kind of apples i bought but they're cooking apples i think these were golden delicious that's what it said on the tack okay i can't remember there's so many apples out there that are available to us now they they just um mate so many apples now and come up with a new strand and some are better for cooking because i've got a in fact i bought my apples for another recipe that i wanted to share with y'all but so i'm gonna be making that very soon but it's with apples all right now let's see one cup of coconut and one cup of chopped pecans okay now that coconut is gonna uh make this cake so moist along with the apple so you got your all your apples and your coconut that you know it's really really those three things are gonna make a wonderful moist cake plus after the cake comes out of the oven y'all we're gonna put a sauce on it and let it run down in there and i'm telling you when we get through we could almost put this in a glass and drink it okay turn when you have to when you get rid of that mix ready it makes it so much easier all right so i'm gonna put this in a bundt pan and um you want it well well greased because there's nothing any worse than and go into the trouble and the expense of making a great cake and then it won't come out of the pan so i think we've got that one sprayed good enough all right whoa eddie you want to turn my pan for me honey yes yes yes and this is uh in your kitchen classic yes it's in kitchen classics but it may have been first in my second cookbook the lady and sons 2 and then the classics you know i hate to say it's my favorite but um the classics cookbook is a combination of my first and second book together which makes it so great because i didn't have to remember which book it was in the first or the second one plus it's um got wedding photos and the recipes or all the things that we served in our wedding reception all those recipes so it's classics just i don't know classics are just hard to beat period aren't they this pan sure does look full doesn't it hope it doesn't bake out i think i'm gonna put it on a cookie sheet to just make sure so it will have a little mess as we can possibly have all right so we're going to bake this cake y'all for one and a half hours so which means we're gonna take a break right here and then after an hour and a half yeah an hour and a half we'll come back and i'll share with y'all the recipe for the topping that we're gonna pour all over this wonderful cake so see you in two maybe two hours hour and a half hour and 45 minutes anyway you'll be amazed at how fast time flies okay y'all our uh grand girls apple cake from georgia i just took out the oven it's piping hot so here we go steve and mary now the topping we are gonna um cook it for just a minute we're gonna melt that butter and then we're gonna add sugar buttermilk and soda and we're gonna pour it over this cake y'all and we're gonna let it sit for one hour and then we're gonna turn it out on a pretty cake pan and uh it's gonna be hard to let it sit for an hour but y'all are just gonna have to trust me i can't sit here for an hour waiting for it to get ready so i can taste it to prove it to you but you just take my word now in fact you take steve and mary ball's word because they know how good it is all right so milk butter okay so our butter's melted now i'm gonna add our sugar and we're gonna let this come to a rolling ball y'all for about one minute and i'm gonna put in the baking soda and the buttermilk there's something about buttermilk and soda you know i'm no scientist but does anybody over at that table know no i don't but there's something there's something about soda and buttermilk that does this magic stuff so a rolling ball for about a minute i make a fig cake and that food cake eddie has a very very similar topping doesn't it yes it's the buttermilk and the butter oh my goodness i think it's identical so this would be great on any cake but you just want that sugar to dissolve all right ball baby bowl you know they say watch pot never balls it's only when you turn your back it doesn't ball over there we go it's starting to fall i think that's been long enough the main thing you want you just want that sugar dissolved all right so here we go and i just took the cake out of the oven y'all and you know what i think i think that i want to put some holes in that cake [Music] this is michael's meat thermometer and it'll make great holes for that sauce to run in there just poke it all around around there okay here we go again that'll help that absorb into the cake a little bit quicker i don't want to lose any of that sauce to the to that hole in the center of the cake i'm gonna have to look up that fig cake in fact um i found that a friend had told me about a fig cake that her mother used to make and she gave me the recipe and one day i was just sitting around reading my brother's cookbook i don't see it now but it had the fig cake recipe in it so bubble was onto that cake long before i was so i'm gonna look that up and see if that's not the identical what lulu okay so steve and mary the hardest thing about this cake is waiting that one hour so thank you so much
