hey y'all hey friends welcome to my kitchen today I'm telling you what this is one of those retro recipes made this everyday young every day of my life from 1989 having 1993 a poll I mean every day because this was such a popular dish on the bag lady I would do a beautiful fruit salad with I sometimes we can't champagne grape before in season those little tiny grapes I put a cluster that and of course a piece of star fruit beautiful strawberries and cantaloupe they were beautiful and I couldn't make enough to send out on our rounds in fact people would call in and say call me a fruit salad and it wasn't it the fruit was that great of course during the summer it really was wonderful but it was the French cream that they got on the side that made it so good so I'm gonna share this recipe with y'all I also make a French custard which a custard to me means cooked you know make one that you could but this is one that you just mix up and no cooking involved and it is wonderful I love to do fruit trays and cut my pineapple in half leaving the top on it too and scoop it out and fill it full of the French cream and it's just not only beautiful but delicious all right so I'm gonna start y'all by I'm not gonna start doing I think I'm gonna start whipping up my whipping cream and now this is the heavy cream y'all don't use half and half because half-and-half won't won't mix you got to have heavy cream 2 1 cup of heavy cream I use 1/4 of a cup of sugar to it and to me that makes it nice and sweet so we're just gonna beat this until it forms soft peaks okay we're back y'all and our whipping cream has been whipped until it forms soft peaks and Eddie just told me he said you might want to say fresh cream he and he said it sounded like I said fresh cream and I was saying French cream so I don't know what party is talking about where I was using that but it's French cream yeah I'm not fresh cream only this is kind of fresh cream but so anyway we've got our our whipped cream and now we're gonna mix together a softened cream cheese and I'm just gonna beat this actually I'm gonna mix this in a little bit bigger bowl because we've got some powdered sugar we got to add to that all right so I'm just gonna this is nice and soft and now we're gonna add our powdered sugar and just whip those two ingredients together until they're kind of creamy oh man I live is this so good there's a lotta Lotta creams out there for your fruit trays [Applause] all right so now I'm gonna add the juice of one lemon and we're gonna add some lemon zest and I don't know if you have one of these zester's but I couldn't do it I couldn't this addition is that's for you huh I know I know Teresa has already zested me some but I just wanted to show y'all what you need just when you have to zest an orange or a lemon you gotta have one these loans Esther all right so I'm gonna beat that a little bit incorporate that now now we're gonna add these two together we're gonna fold that in to our whipped cream oh my goodness I could stay on a fruit diet with this young alright so we just done a foul foul foul now I'm gonna add our lemon zest and I don't add my cysts while I'm squeezing my hand mixer because it seems like the zest just all winds up kind of wanted around your beaters and you lose a lot so I just stir my zest in at the last minute and I did test a little bit over here so we'll get that out too and the last thing we're going to add if you don't line in the restaurant says pineapple juice pineapple juice is great but you know what if you've got orange juice around and open that will work well too and so I'm just gonna get this to the consistency that I want by adding some sort of juice I wouldn't recommend tomato juice like we gel Ranger pineapple is really great all right so it just depends on how thin or how thick you want this and I think that that was what maybe a tablespoon of orange juice young and to me this is a nice consistency and if you don't have a lemon you could use orange zest mmm look how pretty that is get flavoring bit off this beater and it keeps staying okay are these you know what in that Adi on there I bought these at a yard sale or somewhere and I gave it to bobbing cloud I said look it's gonna do it and um I think I'm luck later I got him back they said mama we don't use things like that so here you go I got it back so you know when you're giving you chillin gifts you need to give them something and that you'd like to have because there's a good chance it's gonna come back home to you okay don't what a story I'm gonna be sitting there with the whole bowl this is awesome and look I do more cream than fruit [Music] I do hope y'all enjoy I think I like the zest of two lemons and more lemonade look there so pick you up some fresh fruit young because it's starting to come in pretty good now especially if you live down south and make you up some of this French cream people don't do that genius you
