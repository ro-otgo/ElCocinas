[Music] I'm going to show you my son Jamie's favorite birthday cake every time he has a birthday he says mama please make me my coconut cake and this is so easy it's a basic 1 2 3 4 cake the reason it's called a 1 2 3 4 K is because it calls for one cup of butter 2 cups of sugar 3 cups of flour and 4 eggs so there's your 1 2 3 4 so we're going to start by creaming 1 cup of butter we're going to add two cups of sugar and we're going to add four eggs to this but we had one of the time No in the other there goes away all right now we're going to start by adding our self-rising flour and our coconut milk so here we go you and last I'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla and you're ready to load your batter into your cake pans now I like to use a little container with a handle on it like this and I'll start with one cup one cup for your next one and so on and so on until you've got them all filled I'm going to take the spatula and just work the batter out to the edges I'm going to pick them up and drop them and it's going to bring the air from the cake to the surface and you can see the air bubbles coming up and it will just give us a little bit more level catch these are ready to go into 350 degree oven all right those are safely in the oven I'm going to cook them for about 25 minutes but in the other oven I have some it should be about ready and they are you can see that they've started pulling away from the pan which lets me know that they're ready they look just delicious I'm going to show you how to make the most delectable filling for this cake we're going to start with sugar sour cream coconut and a little milk like we're ready to start sacking now so we're just going to flip that out like that thank goodness it came out night and we're going to take our wax paper now and just slip it a little under the edge of our cake and this will help keep our plate clean now we're going to take that cake layer and I like using a wooden spoon I like about this size height for my holes to be really big so it can seep down in there you can use a fork or a toothpick but I found the bigger the hole the better the cake then we're going to take our filling and just spoon it look at it you can see it running down into those holes moistening that layer from top to bottom there we go and on this layer we're going to start with our toothpicks so you'll have to alert your guests to be on the lookout for toothpicks because you don't want your take to look like the Leaning Tower we're going to do the same thing all over again and another layer of filling all right we're ready for a final layer now not a secret to this cake is letting that cake marinate in the refrigerator for three days and hope nobody's going to touch it and you know I was prepared so I have one right here that's been in there just drinking up that filling you can see by this it's not a beauty but we're going to fix that because we're fixing to make a divinity icing that we're going to cover this cake in and you won't believe the transformation it's going to be like putting on our makeup and this is so simple to make we're going to start with egg whites sugar pinch of salt about 1/4 of a teaspoon of cream of tartar plain old water so we're going to beat this for one minute [Music] so that's been about a minute and at this point we're going to use the double boiler method and we're going to fit this bowl on top of rapidly boiling water and I'm going to set my timer for seven minutes and we're going to beat [Music] okay seven minutes is up I heard our timer go off and now I'm just going to add a little bit of vanilla to it and I'm just going to gently stir that in with a spatula and we're going to start by putting some up on the edge and then we're going to bring it slowly bring it down we're going to make sure that frosting goes all the way to the bottom and covers up every crumb of our cake kind of looks like marshmallow heaven alright now we're just going to bring that icing on up to the top there's only one thing left to do and that's to put the coconut on the top kind of just press it in against your cake so when you get through it's a little frosting probably go lick off looks like a big snowball doesn't it this cake is ready so now we're just ever so gently going to slip our wax paper out from underneath that layer and we have a clean plate what a great trick that is you know it's just great having two of everything that means I can taste this one here we go I'm in heaven so Ellie [Music]
