[Music] all right the dish that I'm going to be fixing for our poker game today is one of genuine Bobby's favorite dishes and it's called crash fruit pizza and it's so good don't you love it guys oh it's so simple I'm going to start with just a refrigerated cookie dough and I'm going to use a standard pizza pan while I'm doing this Jaime's over here cutting fruit and Bobby's over here making the cheese sauce I've got 8 ounces of cream cheese and about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract okay taste that Csonka sometimes I like to slip in just a little bit more the extract see if it needs just a little bit more it is actually it's good it's good like that is he smart mouthing me sometimes I can't figure it out thank you my press you're welcome on all right now about got my dough worked in this pan how you coming darling over there mom I'm just cutting up as fruit what are you cutting it the way I like it you're standing right next to me yes ma'am I am thank you so much you're welcome mama and how's that cream cheese on there darling it's ready to go okay well mine's ready too so I'm going to put this in the oven about 10 to 12 minutes on a 350 degree preheated oven and we're going to have the best pizza dough you ever put me a mouse in just a few minutes all right guys I've already gotten one pizza dough ready all right son you want to frost the brush yes ma'am and it's going to be so good with that fruit and speaking of fruits okay Jamie isn't cutting up the fruit over here imagine that remember to put all your fresh fruit to a lemon wash and that keeps it from browning so quick that's your apples and bananas and anything that can bruise all right guys our pizzas ready to assemble now before we put the fruit I'm going to sprinkle just about maybe a tablespoon of powdered sugar over that cream cheese did just give it a little bit of sweet tape I really want my cookie pizza to look like a regular pizza like it you know how that pizza has that big puff of crust all around it so I really want this pizza to look like that so I'm going to try to achieve that by using a peach around the edge just like this and I'm just going to go all the way around do y'all remember why don't we spend either 20 or 25 consecutive Thanksgiving at uncle Bernie ain't Glennis his house in Statesboro if we weren't eaten we were playing poker weren't we every night and Uncle Bob oh my goodness it would kill him if he lost a dollar then he was he it was ready to take his records and go home you remember yesterday but we had more fun and I remember uncle Bernie God rest his soul when it was time for him to Annie he's throwing his money he'd say a key halt remember man instead I call out y'all because that's what he was full of a key all you might be right you want me to start you know this marmalade or is it me and Sun but don't heat it don't get it like real real thin I've got Jamie back here now heating up just some store-bought orange marmalade and we're going to drizzle that on top of our pizza really only way you can mess up this part is to heat it up so much that it breaks down and it turns into a watery if you want it just a nice medium so it runs off your spoon but yours have to be careful it's too much heat and it'll totally break down I don't think that needs another thing do you guys it's beautiful just high just to sweeten up that fruit just a little bit more guys it's just looking too too good mom you want me to go get some sand on the chips ready shoe chance on them I'm done here oh that's right he'll look good one bite of that you want a piece now yes okay smells so good mm-hmm the fresh fruit is just look at that one give me a thief I'm at a strawberry I think I'm getting strawberry on that not a strawberry your brothers he asked for it first oh my god I'm glad you like it [Music]
