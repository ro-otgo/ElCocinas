- Y'all have heard me say so many times, how much I enjoy hearing from y'all and you sharing recipes. that mean a lot to you from your childhood. And I got the sweetest. letter from Sean Conant, C-O-N-A-N-T, Conant? Is that how you would pronounce it? - [Eddie] Sounds, sounds right. - But he says, thank you. This is to Ms.Feuger to Theresa. He says, thank you for helping Paula Dean film her YouTube cooking show. My fianc√© Logan and I enjoy. watching you, Paula and Eddie every night. And we're from New. Hampshire, just like Eddie. He said, I'm submitting a recipe for you to consider for Paula's show. It's a very honest recipe that. my Grammy Peg used to make. It's very easy to make. and absolutely delicious, and Grammy Peg passed away in 2016. But we think of her very often and we keep her memory alive. with her recipes like this one. And that's what it's all about y'all, keeping those memories alive. And I've got a stray cat that's wanting to get. up here in the picture. Thank you, Theresa. So like I said, that's,. that's what it's all about. Keepin those memories. up front in our head. So I'm going to share with. y'all this cake recipe and it's Grammy Peg's. Cherry Pineapple Dump Cake. And I know we've all. probably made a dump cake at one point in our lives and they are good. And you know, you can change them around. Well, this one calls. for cherry pie filling and crushed pineapple, but Sean tells me to make sure I drain the pineapple real good. And this is, you're going to notice, the only thing I'm going. to have to mess up y'all is that colander right there. No dishes for us'uns. All right. - [Eddie] Have you made. something similar to this? - Oh yes, yes, yes. If you want a quick and easy dessert go-to, these are always great Eddie. Now I have, I used a spray, on my dish so it won't stick. I love cherry pie filling. I love to make fried cherry pies. Oh, they are so delicious. Alright, we're just gonna. spread that out evenly. Then we're gonna add our pineapple. Gonna just give this pineapple a mash to make sure it's drained well, because that's what. Grammy Peg told us to do. I love a good, easy, quick. recipe like this one, cause you never know, you never know, especially when you have kids, who they gonna be bringing home with em. Okay, so now we're just. going to take our cake mix and we are using just a. yellow moist cake, cake mix, and we're going to sprinkle. this over our fruit. Simple, simple, simple. And we just want to make sure that we level it out after. we get it in our pan. - [Eddie] No eggs, no oil? - [Paula] No eggs, no. oil, no nothing Eddie. - [Eddie] Mmm, can't wait to see. - [Paula] It's good, or at least the ones. I've had that are similar were really good. - [Eddie] So this is similar to how you would do your. cobblers a little bit right? - [Paula] Well, no, not kinda really. You make for our cobblers,. we make a batter. - [Eddie] The batter, and you add the dry ingredients. - [Paula] Uh-huh. And then,. we melt a stick of butter in our dish. Okie-doke. Now here comes the part that makes berry berry good. (chuckles) The butter. Calls for 12 tablespoons of melted butter and Sean says if you'll stick. your butter in the freezer, then it'll slice much, much easier. So we're just gonna. distribute this evenly. My cuttin board's dancin on me. Okay. Uh oh. That was two layers. Is that two layers or one? I can't tell. Okay, so this is gonna. have plenty of butter. Cause that was just, that was just a half a stick right there. - [Eddie] It's like a. piece of butter per slice. - [Paula] Yes, that's right Eddie. Just the way we like it. It does make it much easier, I probably didn't have. this butter in the freezer but maybe about 15 minutes. I've got a frog in my throat this morning. I wish he'll hop on out. Oooh-ooh-ohh. I'm liking this a lot. I think the dump cakes. I've made in the past, seems like I've poured. melted butter on it. I don't think I used it like this in pats. So I really, I really like using the pats because you, you know you're gettin it just on every piece. I like it, I like it a lot. - [Theresa] So see you. even learn something new- - [Paula] Mmmhmm. - [Theresa] -with the cake. that you've made a lot. - [Paula] That's right. - [Theresa] That's kind of cool. - [Paula] It is way cool. Like I said, I just love to. know what other folks are doing out there because. we fall into these habits of doing things just one way. And you know, we say, well,. that's the way you do it. But when you get with other people and talk with other people, you realize there, there is other ways. So I enjoy that. So in the oven this goes, let's see what Sean said, 350 for 50 minutes or until golden brown. Doesn't that look good? A butter cake. - [Eddie] Mmmhmm. (Paula laughing) - I like me a butter cake. So Sean. Our dump cake is ready. Oooh we! When you cook in a glass. dish, they're so heavy. I always feel like I'm gonna drop it, like it's going to slip out of my hand. Ooh, it's a bubblin an' a sizzlin. And it's so hot. (chuckles) But do I wanna bite? - [Eddie] I think we. need to scoop some out to see what it looks like. - Yes. - [Theresa] What about. that over ice cream, or ice cream over that? - [Paula] Yeah I was gonna. say, ice cream over that. I think the idea is to let this cool. - [Theresa] When have we ever done that? - [Paula] Yes. Woo! Look, you can see every place that that butter melted did y'all. - [Eddie] Yeah. (Paula and Eddie chuckling) - [Theresa] Was it enough for ya? - [Paula] Yeah. I mean, it could have stood. a little bit more in places but it's good. Cherries and pineapple. It's so hot. I almost can't taste it, but I think it's real good Theresa. - [Theresa] I was gonna say- - You got a tougher mouth than me? - [Theresa] Probably, but I. don't know that I wanna burn it. - [Eddie] Well it smells fabulous. - Doesn't it smell so good? - [Theresa] Maybe if you took a little bit smaller piece Paula. - I know it, princess bites. Paula, princess bites. - I'm going to do it right here. Cause you know, I love the cherry. - Okay. - Like that's a princess bite. - And I love the cake part and all that butter on it. Where you goin? - [Theresa] Oh it's good. - Isn't that good? - [Theresa] I'm a huge cherry fan. - I like cherries too. - [Theresa] Yeah, but when. this cools off just a little scoop of ice cream. - Yes, to put a scoop of ice. cream on this while it's hot. The ice cream would melt, and then you'd have like. a milkshake dump cake. - [Theresa] That is good. I haven't found a. dessert I don't like yet. - Sean thank you so much for sending us Grammy Peg's recipe and just keep her memories alive hon, pass them on to your children.
