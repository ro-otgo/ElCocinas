hey y'all today it's about sweet somethings first i'm gonna be starting with a scrumptious arnold palmer cupcake and then it's mouth-watering cookie dough truffles and then that's the owners of my favorite cookie shop here in savannah y'all stop by to make the greatest oatmeal scotchy cookie you've ever seen and i just couldn't let them leave y'all before showing me how to decorate their signature sugar cookies try not to lick it now [Music] well i'm gonna kick everything off today by making an arnold palmer cupcake now if you came into our restaurant and said i would like an arnold palmer please our waitress would bring you a half a glass of lemonade and a half a glass of sweet tea apparently that's his favorite drink and this recipe is an arnold palmer cupcake so i've got two sticks of unsalted butter that i'm gonna start with and i'm gonna add two cups of sugar [Music] now i'm just gonna cream this together and then i have four eggs up here on the counter that i'm gonna add after i cream our butter and our sugar and i'm gonna add them one at the time giving it a chance to incorporate into our butter and sugar mixture look at that beautiful color all right now our liquid is gonna be our tea now i have taken five regular sized tea bags and i have steeped it with a cup of milk you just heat up your milk drop in your tea bags and let it steep for about 15 or 20 minutes so here's the tea part to our arnold palmer cupcakes and that goes all right now we've got to come in there with the lemon now i'm just going to grate probably about a half a teaspoon of lemon zest that looks about right now i'm gonna add one teaspoon of lemon juice and i'm just gonna eyeball that that's about a teaspoon all right now we're just gonna come back in here and mix all those ingredients in there we go i just adore cupcakes my mother used to make them when i was a little girl to me you just can't beat a cupcake all right now we've got to get together our dry ingredients that we need to add to our wet ingredients and i'm gonna need two and a half cups of all-purpose flour you have to be precise because bacon is a formula three-fourths of a tablespoon of baking powder and that's gonna make our cupcakes get fat and pretty and now three-fourths of a teaspoon of salt and then we're just going to add them to our wet ingredients and the bowl back goes and then i'm going to take our little mixer and mix up those dry ingredients into our wet ingredients all right now i'm going to turn that up and just whip that on out all right there we go that was simple enough all right i want to load up our muffin tins i'm lining mine with paper because it works out better for a cupcake and i'm just going to put one heaping scoop into the muffin tins and i'm using a medium sized scooper my oven has been preheated to 350 degrees and we're gonna bake these for about 20 to 22 minutes so in they go let's make our frosting that's gonna go in our arnold palmer cupcakes now i've got two sticks of butter that's at room temperature i've got a half a cup of our milk and tea mixture that i made earlier i'm gonna cream our butter soften it up and then i'm gonna add two cups of confectioner's sugar there we go this is gonna be a real rich buttery frosting now i'm gonna start adding our liquid that that looks like hot chocolate doesn't it or chocolate milk boy would the kids be surprised if they picked that up and started guzzling it thinking it was chocolate milk they'd be real surprised [Music] all right so i think that's about right all right we've got our tea milk milk tea in there and now i'm gonna add about a teaspoon of lemon juice there we go i'm gonna keep beating this until it's nice and creamy and when we come back we're gonna frost those cupcakes cause today it's about sweet something coming up it's cookie dough truffles cookie dough lover in your house is gonna be so very happy and later those two smart cookies are stopping by to make a giant

just trying to jump ahead and get some nuts chopped up for our next dish but since y'all are back let's come on over here and finish up these cupcakes now i'm just going to put a little thin layer and then i'm gonna fill our pastry bag with our icing and just cover our arnold palmer's with little stars aren't those pretty and we can stick a straw in it because an arnold palmer you would actually have a straw because you're drinking it in that cute and not only is it cute it's so very tasty well come on down here because i want to get this next recipe going and this is a no cook cookie dough truffle and we're gonna start with three quarters of a cup of packed brown sugar pack that in there good and another fourth one stick of butter that's at room temperature and just cream that together i know some girls that say by the time they get through tasting the dough there's none left to bake cookies some people just love cookie dough so that's what these truffles are gonna taste like okay now i'm gonna measure out two cups of flour one teaspoon of vanilla extract all right we're going to add one can of sweetened condensed milk got that mixed together now when y'all popped back in on me i was chopping nuts i'm gonna need about a cup of chopped pecans you can use the nut of your choice so bear with me while i get my nuts cut [Music] there we go that looks about like a cup now i'm gonna add a half a cup of little mini semi-sweet chocolate morsels so we're just gonna mix that up and that looks like some mighty fine cookie dough doesn't it and then we're gonna start rolling our truffles now you'll want to take your hands and dip them down in some flour because this cookie dough is going to be a little sticky so you just want to roll them into balls about the size of a walnut just like that [Music] you want to keep your hands rolled in that flower otherwise you can have a sticky mess so i'm gonna roll these out stick these in the refrigerator and let them set for about two hours now i've got some down here that i've had in the refrigerator chilling for us so here's our cookie dough after it's set up now back here behind me on the stove i've got some milk chocolate that i melted over hot water and we're just going to take our balls and we're just going to run them around in that chocolate and lift them out just like that doesn't that look good [Music] the cookie dough lover in your house is gonna be so very happy and then we're gonna let those set up in the refrigerator and let that chocolate harden on them and they're gonna be so good but you know what i got

decorate everything every single cookie uh-oh yeah i'm not good at this do i do the whole frog the whole frog and then we have some eyeballs for him right there in the oh i just see that now is there anything special about this icing is it just i think it's the almond flavoring that people are so attracted to we've been accused of putting something in it that will be addictive we don't tell people what it is and this icing has to be fairly thin doesn't it it does so it will spread it can't be like a icing on a cake no no i can't believe i need to lick it now does everybody clean y'all's cookies by licking them we have children who come in and their parents buy them a cookie and they lick all the icing off first all right now just like right there oh lookie just comes to life now where do you
