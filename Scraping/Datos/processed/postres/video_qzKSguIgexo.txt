- In case, just in case y'all don't recognize this pretty lady that's in my kitchen today.. - Oh Lord have mercy. - Her name is Lisa Clapp, and you are gonna fall in love with her the same way I did the first time I met her. at one of my book signings. And, I'm gonna make what has become one of Lisa's all-time favorite desserts. - Yes girl. - And boy, hottie. We're going down memory lane because I'm gonna make a Fresh Peach Gooey Butter Cake. - Girl, stop, stop, stop! (Paula laughs) I can't wait, I cannot wait. - Well, this is so easy. - Okay. - It's so easy Lisa. - Put me to work. - Well, I wanna put your mouth to work. - Oh, okay. I'm good at that. I'm real good at that. - I want you... Wait, lemme get this thing. (Lisa laughs) Come on. Unwound.. - I love it. - Okay, here we go. So, I'm gonna start with. just a yellow cake mix. Now you know, it just depends. on what flavor you want. You can use chocolate,. you can use red velvet, you can use lemon or whatever cake mix they got out there. Now I'm just gonna dump this in. And this is gonna be the crust. to our gooey butter cake. - Mm, girl. - And all we need is one stick of melted butter and one egg. I know you're holding the butter. - I'm holding your butter girl. - All right. So now I'm thinking to. crank up this loud mixer and I want you to talk. - Over the mixer? - No, I don't know. I don't know if we're. gonna be able to do it. - Oh why -. - I'm not been here very long. It doesn't take but a minute. - Okay. - I'm just gonna beat this stuff, mix it up and then we go pat it. - You want me to tell you, the first time I actually saw this? - No, I want you to tell me and everybody how you got started with your Facebook. - Oh! Oh, that's easy. I have two sons that I adore. Sort of like somebody I know.. - That sounds familiar. - Right. And when they were. starting to get to that age that I knew they were gonna. both be leaving the nest, 'cause they're four years apart. First one had already left the nest. - Uh huh. - I did okay. I did okay, right? And then we - - How far did he fly from the nest? - Not far but you know, I know not to land in on his nest without calling up hell. - Oh God, yes. - I learned that really. quick and in a hurry. (Paula laughs) So when he - when my. oldest went to NC State, It was about 45 - 50 minutes. down the road, right? - Okay. - But I wouldn't dare just ascend on him and his college life. - No. No, you don't do that Mama. - I missed him terribly but I still had baby boy at home, which is Spencer, my youngest one. So I probably just suffocated. him today up with the tension. - Uh huh. - And he's very like "Back off." you know, "I'm going to bat," "You need to step off my plate." - He's low-maintenance. - He is. And both of my boys. are in a different way, but here's what I'll tell you. I had a lot of energy and I loved to cook. It's definitely my love language, and so - - Well, living on a farm. - Yes. - How can you not? - Well, you'd be surprised at. people that say they don't, but I love it, and my. momma taught me to cook and I just love it. - All those wonderful vegetables. - Exactly. So, when -. - And meats. - The anticipation, of both. of them being out of my nest, I thought I got to find. something to do that's positive. - Something to do, uh huh. - I wanted to encourage other people and I wanted to teach. other people how to cook. So, I started doing it on Facebook, just as fun, you know? And then, people started really liking it. (Paula laughs) And I was shocked.. - Of course they did. - I was shocked. Shocked,. shocked, shocked. And then when my oldest. was a sophomore in college, I said to him: "What do you think about me. making this into like a vlog?" 'cause it's not a blog, it's a vlog. And he said, "Mama, I think. you'd be great at that." And I was like - I cannot. believe he just said that. So, I started sharing recipes that are near and dear to my heart, that I used when they were growing up and it just snowballed as far as viewers and followers and all that.. - Yes, yes. It just takes time. - It does.. - Time to build. - But if you're doing something you love, I just think that - - It's amazing that they. call that work, isn't it? - Exactly. (Paula laughs) And I have to do it anyway.. - It's just too amazing. So feeding my family. and people that I love just comes natural to me. I love to do it. - It's who you are. - It's who I am. Yes, Ma'am. - So you have a lot of. viewership now, don't you? - I do. I think, you know,. I don't look at it a lot. I really don't. - I don't look at mine either. - I just don't because I'm. doing what I love anyway. The last time I got a report from my person that does all that, Janet from another planet, it was 320,000. - Oh, that's wonderful. - So, you know.... - That is wonderful. - Listen, the viewers. have been what's made it. - Absolutely. The reason I started. doing this on YouTube, the pandemic set in and I thought: Oh my gosh! What do I - ? And I couldn't get off my mind, people that were in a single-household. - Yes. - Being quarantined alone. - Yes, yes, yes. - And I said, well maybe I. can just shoot some videos and just for a little. entertainment for people. - Yes, and it brightens their day. I see what they say to you. They call you their "sunshine" and "you brighten my day." And, you know, I love all those folks. - If we can do that for. somebody else in a small way... - Yes, yes absolutely. Absolutely. - I feel blessed about it. - And I can't tell you Lisa, how many letters I've gotten from people saying, "thank you." - Yes. - "Thank you for giving us an opportunity to learn a little bit and laugh." - Yes, yes, yes! - The pandemic, and them in quarantine. - Yes girl. So there is a lot of women... - Do you like for me to take that? - And just sit it right there. - I just feel so honored. let me just keep - - Oh no, I gotta have this right back. - Oh, well, let me give it back to you! - We not even gonna. have to wash this bowl. - Okay, I like that. - We just gonna be able to use it again. - All right. - And I'm going to need. another stick of melted butter. - Oh, I can do that. Let me get you some butter. - Please get me some butter.. - Yes girl. Okay, I didn't use this stick, but where's our other stick - - We gotta have a whole stick. - Oh, we gotta have a whole stick? - Oh yes.. - I'ma let you-- - Oh, here it is. Here it is. - I'll melt your butter. - Okay.. - Okay? You don't have to pull it out. - It's kinda like being the. cream in somebody's coffee, but I'ma melt your butter. - All right, we got the butter, Lisa! - Yes, Ma'am! I'll do it. - And I'm going to get some. beautiful, fresh peaches. - Yum! - Teresa actually bought these. I don't know where - did. you get them from Davis? - [Teresa] Yes, Ma'am. - Yum!. - Well, they are beautiful. I actually processed. them last night, Teresa. - [Teresa] Ooh! - [Paula] Look at those peaches! - [Lisa] Oh, they look wonderful. - [Paula] Now let me tell. you what I'm gonna do first. - [Teresa] We made peach. ice cream the other day and I made-- - [Lisa] Oh! Home-made peach ice-cream. - [Teresa] And I made peach. cobbler when I went home. - Man, the privilege of. bring in peach country, girl. - Yes honey.. - I love it. - We are. We've got some wonderful,. wonderful, wonderful things for work with in. this area of the country that are just there at our disposal. - Yes, yes. - Alright I know I feel like. I'm walking in circles but... - That's alright. - But one thing about it is. that it's a small circle. - Yeah, I like it. (Paula laughs) I like it. - [Paula] All right, so I'm gonna make a fresh peach gooey butter cake. - [Lisa] Mmm! - [Paula] And like I said,. I did these last night. I processed them last night and put some fruit fresh on them. And now we're gonna just. take these place off. - [Teresa] Did you sugar them? - [Paula] I put a little because I wind up giving these to the triplets. I put just a sprinkle of. little monk fruit on it. - [Lisa] Oh! - Because, that's the sweetener. that I know that Cloud uses. - [Lisa] Mmhm! - [Paula] And she wouldn't mind. - [Lisa] Oh yes! - Here taste that, let. me see if it's sweet. - Oh yes, let me taste some. - They're not real sweet. - No, but they're good! I like 'em! But what did you say you're. sweetening them with? What's it called? - Monk fruit. - Monk fruit! - Uh uh. - And so, that might be a. healthier option If I were like - - Oh yeah, it just has no calories. - Oh! - Look in that pantry right. there, Lisa, in that long one. - [Lisa] Yeah. - Open it up and see if you see some sitting right there; a. little container of fruits. - Oh, I see it. Now, can. you buy this anywhere? - Yeah. - I mean, like, it doesn't. have to be a specialty-stored? - No. - Oh, I'm gonna need a. picture of this before we go 'cause that's a good idea. (laughing) That's a great idea. - Now I'm gonna put... I'm gonna a little sugar. - Since we're going to be eating it. - Uh huh. Since I know the babies are. not going to get things... - All right. - You are so sweet to. do that for the babies. - Oh, listen. (Lisa laughs) Their mother and father is very peculiar. - [Lisa] Mm-hmm. - About what they put in their mouth. - Uh huh. - Their mother is a triathlete. - Wow. - Their father is a purple belt Jiu-jitsu. - Yes. - And they both have beautiful bodies. - And beautiful everything,. is what I'm saying. - They eat very, very healthy. - Yes - I'm just going to drain. this 'cause I don't think we want that much water in our peaches. - I can't wait. - I just wanna make sure I have enough. And you know what else. I'm gonna slip in this? - Tell me. - Some almond extract. - Do you want me to get it for you? - I don't know honey I'm gonna. have to - I may have to hunt. - Oh, that is.. That's vanilla.. - That's vanilla. - [Teresa] Lisa, you where. talking about your Facebook. - I was.. - [Teresa] When we-- - Oh yeah, so I wanna finish hearing... - Well honestly, I mean, a hobby, turned into something. that became a bigger entity and it was not anything that I did. - Had planned. - It was a -- - Not planned. You didn't. - It was a God drop.. It has been a God drop. I have met the nicest people along the road on this journey. and I continue to do so. I mean, people just... It's been a blessing. I don't know how else to put. it, honestly. I really don't. - I know exactly what you're saying. Now, I just put those in a. strainer, and let me sieve. - So keep talking now, Lisa. - Okay, okay anyway -. - I want to know. - So when the Facebook. started gaining interest. - Mm-hmm! - Hurricane Floyd was coming. through North Carolina and that very weekend,. for whatever reason, you know how you worry about your kids especially if they're. not home with you, right? - That's right. - Whatever reason, I was. live talking to the viewers, and it just naturally took course that I talked about the Bible, I talked about God and what he means to us in times of trouble, in times. of storms of life, period. And the viewership went up even more. So, I think... You know, you. were saying earlier about people needing that positive, some laughter, some. entertainment, but you know, I wanna learn something too, you know? - Yes, laughter is so important though. - Yes. - It's so important. Did you know, laughing is. the healthiest exercise you can do for your heart? - Absolutely, I believe. that. I believe that. - Laughter. Yes, so if we can. help people do that I mean... - And it ain't no skin off our back. - No, not any at all. - No skin off our back. - And it's - the whole. process has been a blessing. Blessing is the best adjective I can use. - I know, I know, I know... That you are a real. blessing to your friends and fans that follow you. - Well, I try. - Because you got this. dynamic personality. (Lisa giggles) Those of y'all that are. with her in her Facebook. Gosh, my knives need. sharpening so bad, Lisa. - I just keep it real Paula.. - There you go. - I think that's the biggest thing. - Me too. Some days I'd come in here. and I aint got no makeup or my hair straightened. - Exactly. And you know where I've felt - - But I don't think they care. - Well, I have felt. especially female viewers. They've said things to me like this: "That gives me confidence. to be able to do that. To watch another woman. just be in her pajamas." - Yes, yes. - "And her hair all up on her head and you're cooking for your family or, you know, you're sharing a moment." And I think it empowers other. people to be able to do that. - Absolutely. - And, why not? I mean... - Absolutely. - We get one chance, right? One. chance to make a difference. And if you can make it. in a small place, great. - And I used to catch a lot of flack when I was on TV for doing that. - Can we take that? (Paula laughs) I love being the sous chef here. - For doing that. For licking my fingers. - Yeah. - Now, I didn't do that in the restaurant when I was working in the restaurant. - Right. - But in my own kitchen. - Right. - Come on, please. - Yeah. - If you say you don't lick your fingers in your own kitchen? - I kind of feel sorry for them. - I'd have to call you a storyteller. (laughing) - I kinda feel sorry. for people that say that 'cause I'm thinking, well, you missing all the fun! - Mmm! Oh my Gosh.. - I mean for real! - [Teresa] So Miss Paula, what. all have you put in there? - Okay so Lisa, we have our. base, that's gonna be our crust. - Okay. - [Paula] That's one yellow cake mix, one egg and one stick of melted butter. - [Lisa] Love it. - [Paula] Now in this bowl,. we've got one pound of 10X, 4X confectioner sugar, whatever. you call it, two eggs... And that's it right now. We're going to be adding. our melted butter. - [Lisa] Okay. - After we get this kinda mixed up. - [Lisa] I'll still hand it to ya. - [Paula] Okay. Oh, thank you. - [Lisa] Listen, it's hard when you're not used to having help in your kitchen. - [Paula] I know! - [Lisa] And then all of a. sudden you have it, it's harder. - [Paula] I know it is.. - [Lisa] Why? - [Paula] I know it is. - [Lisa] I'll take that. - [Paula] Okay, and I'll give it to you. - [Lisa] All right! Give it to me, girl. Give it to me! - [Paula] All right so, if you give me one of them rubber spatulas back there... - [Lisa] I can get that, yes I can. - [Paula] You look very pretty today. - [Lisa] You are so sweet. - [Paula] Thank you, I love your dress. - [Lisa] It's very comfortable. and I have the hormones. (Paula laughs) Are you familiar? - [Paula] I ain't got no hormones! - [Lisa] Well, it's hot. This time alive, 51 years old, it's hot. So I like things that are airy. and that don't stick to me and that they're thin enough. - Yes. Yes. - Cause I ain't trying to be extra hot. You know what I'm saying? - No, I can't do it, Lisa. I can't do it. You know, I sweat. This is where I sweat. From my neck up. - Yes! - I don't sweat under my arms. - Hair, your everything. I know. - My hair will get soaking. wet, won't it, Teresa? - I tell you, it is an issue. - I can walk out there one time and come back in and I'll be wet. All right! - That is looking at yummy. - Ain't that looking good? - May I? (surprised gasps) Oh girl! - [Paula] If you didn't, I'd be so upset. - Girl, what you talking about? - Alright so this is. what I'm gonna add to it. Since we're making a fresh. peach gooey butter cake. - Mm, I won't do it twice, just once. - Oh no, that's all right. You. just use a different finger. - Okay, hold on. (Paula laughs) - Oh, Lord have mercy. - Alright, I'm going to add like a half a tea spoon of almond extract. - [Lisa] Okay. - [Paula] Because almond. compliments peaches and cherries like no other. - [Lisa] Yum, that sounds heavenly. - [Paula] Yes. - [Lisa] Mm-mm! - [Paula] All right so I'm. just gonna beat that again. And I don't know if I got. enough peaches mashed up or not. - [Lisa] Do you need me to mash some more? - [Paula] I don't know. Yeah,. let's put it in here, Lisa. - [Lisa] Okay. - [Paula] Put that in there.. Put those peaches in there. - [Lisa] Oh, and we're. gonna stir 'em into this. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Lisa] Oh yay, okay. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Lisa] I could do that. - [Paula] Okay. We may need some more. - [Lisa] All right! This looks delicious. Don't you just love the color of peaches? - [Paula] Yes. - [Lisa] And I love that you can support your agriculture. around here, you know? - [Paula] Yes, I think. we might need some more. - [Lisa] All right, let's do it. Oh, let me have that.. Lord, don't waste that! - All right, Lisa and I. added a few more peaches and I like the way that looks. You like that? - [Lisa] Girl, yes I do. - [Paula] You like that little. flavor of that little almond. - [Lisa] Love the almond, love it. - [Teresa] So Paula, how many peaches would you say that was? Maybe four, five? - [Paula] You know,. peaches are like girls. They come in all different sizes. (Lisa laughing) And that was probably.... I think it was two cups? - [Lisa] At least. - [Paula] Mashed? - [Lisa] At least. - [Paula] But you just put what you want. - [Lisa] Golly that looks good. - [Paula] Look at that. - [Lisa] Don't you dare;. can I lick the bowl? - [Paula] Oh, gosh,. I'll leave some in there so you'll have something to lick. - [Teresa] Now Lisa's. about to get in trouble because she's trying. to take over my stuff. Oh, my gosh. - Normally Lisa, waste not, want not with me. I'll clean that bowl that. way, don't even need washing. All right, we're going to. put this in the oven, y'all, at 350 and we're gonna bake it. Now here's the risky... Not risky... This is where sometimes. people make mistakes. Look at you! - Listen! (Paula laughs) I would have licked that - Fine, I'm good! - People, because the more cake is in it, - Yes. - You think, well, it. should be like a cake! - Yes. - But it's not. You want that center to. jiggle just a little bit. - Okay. - The biggest mistake people. make is overcooking them. - Okay. - So I say anywhere from. 40 to 50 minutes, maybe, you know, depending on your oven. But I have a feeling. that ours is going to be, because of the peaches we put in it, - Yes. - it is going to juicer so, we might have to. cook a little bit longer. - I like juicer. - So, in the oven, I'm going to set the timer. for 35 minutes y'all, and then we'll go from there. But I have a feeling if Miss Lisa and I have. to eat it with spoons... - We will! - We will! - Okay, it's ready Lisa! - Oh it smells... - I want y'all to look at this. Now see how it's jiggling some? That being that we use fresh peaches Lisa? That produced a lot of juice. So I had to cook this one longer. - Can I touch it too? - Please touch my gooey. - [Lisa] Oh! Yes, yes! - But we can't cut this. now while it's hot. It's way too hot. - Right, right. - But it would just. ooze and run everywhere. But when it cools, it's gonna firm up. But remember, the name. is gooey butter cake. So it's supposed to be kinda gooey. - Mmhm, I can't wait. - And I'm just sick that we can't cut it. But I'm glad y'all get to. see that little jiggle. - I think that's the main point. - Right there in the center. See that little jiggle? That's what I want, a little jiggle. There is no way Lisa, that I could cut this. right now and it work. - Smells good. - Do you think we could just taste it? - I noticed you found some spoons! - Girl, yes! Just a little. - Go ahead, you're my guest. - Can I go in first? - Please go in. - [Teresa] Lording the corner. - This jiggles about like. my stomach sometimes. (Paula laughs) But I don't care. I really don't. - Alright now I hope you got. some peaches with that bite. You may have to... - I'm gonna blow it just a little bit. - All right see now, I'm making sure I got the cream cheese. - Oh, it all smells good. - Oh, it's hot. - Bon appetit. - Bon appetit y'all. - Oh, wait a minute, it's. temperature hot, hold on. - You can't do it. You'll. skin your mouth, Lisa. - You know, I skinned it before. - You've 'skunned it before? - I've 'skunned it and I'll. skin it again probably. Mm, I got peach! - Good! (Paula laughs) - Georgia peach! - Good. - Love it. Oh my gosh. - Mine is still way too hot. - I can't wait for y'all. to try it too. Delicious. Mm, girlfriend. - I bet you, we have. cooked a gooey butter cake in 50 to 75 different flavors. That is no kidding. So, you know, you can. play with your bases, your different kind of cakes,. your different fillings. You can just do it. anyway you can think of. - It's delicious. I love it. Thank you so much. - I've enjoyed you being. here so much today Lisa - Oh my gosh. - So, so so so so soo much! - If my husband wouldn't. miss me, I'd just stay. - Okay. (laughing) - Mine's out of town, so - (Lisa laughs) - I would stay up, I think I really would. - This reminds me of a. cuttable peach cobbler. Loving best dishes y'all. Bye! - See ya!
