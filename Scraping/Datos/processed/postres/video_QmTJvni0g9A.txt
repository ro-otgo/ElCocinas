- [Paula] I love your book, Eddie. what is that? - Well, for Mother's Day, I thought I would make a treat that my mother always made for us. - [Paula] On Mother's Day? She made it on Mother's Day? - Well, no, not on Mother's Day. This was just something that, I would say, you know, after school, when we'd. come home from school, there would always be. something on the counter. - [Paula] My mama would always have warm banana pudding.. - Yeah. - And your mama would have these. And what are they called? - Well, you know, they're just graham- - Good.. - Crackers. - They're called good.. - Graham cracker treats. I guess.. - Uh-huh. - Anyway.. - Tell them about the book. - All the way back when they. made wallpaper like this, when the Earth was still green. - [Paula] When the Earth. was still flat. (chuckles) - I mean, this wallpaper. book, you would have to say- - [Paula] The pages are yellow. - Probably came from, maybe, the 19- - [Paula] Now, was that your mama's? - No, I made it when I was in the- - [Paula] You covered it with wallpaper? - In third grade, we made-. - No. - Actually this was done in fourth grade. - [Paula] So, you. would've been how old, 10? - I would've been 10 or nine probably. But, anyways, for Mother's. Day our teacher said, "We're gonna make a, you know, a cookbook and bring in your favorite recipe." - [Paula] Be all for. mothers, for Mother's Day. - I remember cutting out the wallpaper and messing up and having. to have to redo it. And I ended up with this- - [Paula] Picture of perfection. - This ugly wallpaper, yeah. - No, it's beautiful. The pages have even yellowed. - So, anyways, when they used. to make copies, way back when, it was, what did they call. it, a mimeograph machine? - Yeah.. - And, actually, I think it was a sheet and you actually did the carbon copies. - Yeah, you remember carbon paper? - Yeah, we actually had the carbon paper and we had to write on it, and then the teacher would. crank it through the machine. - You old, Eddie. You old. (both laughing) - When I went to school,. we didn't have a machine. - I can honestly say, I. mean, graduating high school, we had to take a course,. in order to graduate, last minute, take a course in computers, 'cause it was going to be. the new thing. (chuckles) And I kept thinking it's never gonna work. Never gonna work.. - Never gonna fly. (both laughing) You should have invested in stock. - Yes. Well, would've, could've. - You'd been somewhere else, though, and you wouldn't have been here with me, so, I'd have cried. - Anyways, this was a treat. that my mother made for us. - [Paula] So, I just. gotta look at this now, 'cause this was your mother's gift. Did you write in it? - I did. Well, at the page it was on. So, anyways, we are doing. graham cracker, crackers, as a little treat and what you'll need is. a half pound of butter. - Okay, so that would be two sticks. - Two sticks, melted. with a half cup of sugar, and you're just gonna stir. it around a little bit, get it all mixed up with the butter. - This kind of reminds. me of that white trash. What is it called that we make Theresa? - Oh, with the-. - Dawn makes it at Christmas. - Saltines.. - Saltine crackers. - Yeah, with saltines. Oh, y'all, the first page in Eddie's book. - Now, that-. - You can show those to some (indistinct) Theresa, please. - [Camera operator] Absolutely.. Maybe, (indistinct). You wanna shoot it this way?. - Yeah. - Yum.. - So it's all just butter and sugar, all nicely melted. The teacher included that and- - It's so beautiful. - If you read through it, it's everything a child, you know, I wish every child could have. everything that's listed. - I'm gonna read this to y'all. - All right, you read and I'm gonna- - Because I've read this somewhere before, a long time ago.. - I just looked up the author and I'll hopefully have the name by the time you're done.. - Oh good. - But it was actually, I think this was written in the 1950s. - It sounds like it would be. And it's, "Children learn what they live." If a child lives with. criticism, he learns to condemn. If a child lives with. hostility, he learns to fight. If a child lives with. ridicule, he learns to be shy. If a child lives with shame,. he learns to feel guilty. If a child lives with tolerance,. he learns to be patient. If a child lives with. encouragement, he learns confidence. If a child lives with praise,. he learns to appreciate. If a child lives with. fairness, he learns justice. If a child lives with security,. he learns to have faith. If a child lives with approval,. he learns to like himself. If a child with acceptance and friendship, he learns to find love in the world. That's getting a little faded. - [Eddie] Yeah, the whole. thing is a little faded. - [Paula] Look at that. - But isn't that just wonderful to... - I need to read this every day. - Yeah. - You know, concerning my. children and the grandchildren. - [Camera operator] And this. was a mother's day gift? - This was a mother's. day gift, yes, we made- - I love you, mom. (Eddie chuckles) Love Slugger! Is that what they called you? - No, no, no. That's not my recipe. My recipe is-. - Oh. - Right there. - Oh, so, this is-. - All the kids in the class. - A recipe from all the kids.. - All the kids in the class did their own recipes. - Stuffed peppers, onion. oven fried chicken. I know you treasured this. - Well, you know, I found it. - Hamburger pie, yum. - My mother gave me my baby. book, not that long ago, and that was inside there. - Swank porter house steak. They must have been rich. (chuckles) - Greek cookies, peanut butter fudge. Oh, I love this. So, each child, it was. done in their handwriting. - [Eddie] Yes, we each. had to write a recipe. - [Paula] Pita, rhubarb cobbler. - [Eddie] I went to school. with a lot of Greek children. All right, the recipe-. - Graham crackers. Is that yours, Ed?. - Actually calls for about 25. That one, yeah.. - Yeah. - Called for 25-. - How long did it take you to learn how to spell your last name. (Paula laughing). - Oh, I learned real quick. (chuckles) I learned my ABCs real quick. - Chocolate marble squares. - I'm gonna take these up. - To mom from Mike. Oatmeal cookies, there's two oatmeal. Two oatmeal cookie recipes.. - Yes, I was just reading that and the recipes are very different. - Uh-huh, yeah, one calls for shortening and one calls for butter. - So, I'm gonna use a little bit- - What is this? Is that a Greek word? - (stammers) finikia, yeah. I think it's like the spun phyllo. - Butter, orange juice, sugar. - I am going to use some. crushed toffee on some and some mini chocolate morsels. My mother used peanuts. - [Paula] Oh she did. - So, we're gonna use some crush peanuts. And, you know, usually when. you're going through school, you usually have a favorite teacher and you remember a favorite teacher. Well, my favorite teacher was always the third grade, Mrs. Shea, and everything that we did in. her class just stuck with me. This cookbook was actually. done in the fourth grade but all my teachers, I kind. of judged by Mrs. Shea. (chuckles) So, it was wonderful, when I went into fourth. grade, I had Mrs. Jenner and she was so similar. to her, which was great. - I've just gotta show y'all this. Happy Mother's Day for a. sweet mother on Mother's Day. Thank you for being so. nice through the years. Love Eddie.. (Eddie chuckles) May the 8th, 1981, Friday. - 1981, okay, there you go. - [Camera Operator] And this is gonna be showing Mother's Day. week, so this is perfect. - And you did a fabulous. job with the wallpaper. (Eddie chuckles) I mean, I would expect nothing less. - And we actually did that. I remember putting it in. the press and everything and I honestly remember. messing up the first one and had to do it over.. - It's perfect. I would've thought that. it came that way, Eddie. - Nope. So, okay- - I always knew you were very special. - 350 degrees for about nine minutes and you'll have a tasty treat. - I can't wait to taste them. Oh, I saw all y'all eating them earlier, But I was busy trying to fix. a broken face. (chuckles) Eddie, they look delicious. And it's one of those. simple, simple things that the children can make for. Mother's Day for their mother. - It is and I do remember. making it with my mother. And it really is, if you like. graham cracker pie crust- - If you like sugar, yeah.. - If you like sugar. But, I mean, they're good. warm and they're good cold. - [Paula] May I see your platter? - Yes. This is exactly- - You did just a variety of things. What is that, just peanuts?. - Toffee. - Toffee and-. - Toffee, chocolate morsels and then chopped nuts.. - Is that semi-sweet or milk? - [Eddie] Yes, semi-sweet. - [Paula] And you put pecans on these and you say this is just toffee bits. - Just toffee. - Hmm, they look so good and I love the simplicity of them. So, which one should I taste? You don't have any with. nuts and chocolate, do you? - No, I didn't. I didn't mix them up. - Well, seeing how I love nuts. (Eddie laughs) Oh my gosh. They're crispy, aren't they? - Yeah, they firm up pretty quickly. (Paula chuckles) - Now, how can something. that simple taste that good? - Very simple. - Children, (crunching) if you're old enough to be in the kitchen and turn on an oven,. make this for your mama. You'll get lots of praises. - So, I mean, my mom,. thank you for the recipe. Thank you for always making them for me and I wish you were here. to have mine. (chuckles) - Thank you, Carol, for raising such a wonderful young man.
