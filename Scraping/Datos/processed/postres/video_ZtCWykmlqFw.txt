- This recipe is walking. me down mystery lane. Y'all, I've formulated this way of brownies when I was still. working outta my house. And I just kind of got tired. of the same old brownies. So I said, I'm gonna think of some way to just. shuffle it up a little bit. So I am going to take. four tablespoons of butter and put 'em in my pan and melt that. And then I'm going to add my pecans to it and a cup of brown sugar. But in the meantime, I. just use a box brownie, you know just whatever is your favorite. What is that? Oh, I've never used this kind. It has a chocolate syrup in it. Yay. Little extra chocolate. never hurt anything. Did it. And I'm assuming that you just mix it. - [Teresa] You just mix it in. I make that one all the time. - Oh, you do? Add brownie mixin's Okay. - [Teresa] Trying to. throw you a curve ball. - Yeah, I like it. I like it. I like to try new. things, but to be honest, I always use the Duncan Hines chewy. Cause I just found that. gave me a chewy brownie which was what I was going after. Okay. All right. I think I'm gonna get. a little bowl for this and mix my oil, I'm going right by the package of the brownie mix y'all. An egg and water. I think it called a third,. a fourth of a cup of water. A third of a cup of. vegetable oil and one egg. So we're just gonna beat. those, get back in that bowl. All right. So we're just gonna fold. that in and stir it. The directions says, you know,. until everything's combined. I thought I was getting. out a big enough bowl but I could have stood. - [Teresa] That one's. going, I'm watching it. - I know it. I could have stood. - [Teresa] Now we're here. No, I'm gonna make it. I could have stood one bowl up though. One more size up. I'm telling you what Teresa. is on the ball today. She is. I don't pick it up and. use it before she is. - [Teresa] Well, I'm trying. not to grab the things. I believe you might need. - Go into the sink with. it, which is wonderful. Okay. I hear my butter starting to bubble. I'm gonna go ahead and throw in my pecans. Now you can use any kind. of nut you like, you know I've gotten where I'm. a big fan of walnuts, and oh my gosh, I've always. loved macadamia nuts. Those things are high as a cat's back. Y'all ever buy macadamia nuts? - [Teresa] Not really. They're good in cookies - Uh-huh. I love them. But you can see, this is. getting mixed up really well. You don't have to pull out. any kind of mixer for this. You can just do it with. a little elbow grease and that's all you need. All right, let's see, I'm. gonna stir this together and I'm gonna add my brown sugar. Let that brown sugar kind of melt. And this is what I called. my caramelized brownies and people really seem to like them a lot. (pan scraping) All right. So you can see our brown sugar is starting to melt a little bit, starting to melt into that butter. (pan scrapping) Theresa would you mind getting. me the vanilla flavoring? - [Teresa] Not at all. I take it. You're gonna add something to it. - I change every recipe. I have ever made y'all. Yeah I think a little vanilla. flavoring would be nice. Don't you? We just gonna cook this for. a few minutes y'all not long. And while we're waiting. on that, I am gonna take-- Huh? I don't know. It's, I made some in like a,. looked like a vinegar jar. One time you see that? (can spraying) - [Teresa] I see one. - The recipe calls for 13x9x2. But this is an 11x8 that I'm using. I think a 13x9 might be a little too thin. You found it?. - [Teresa] I thought this is - [Teresa] It, the one. that I got in my hand. - Yes. See, that's an old vinegar jar. Eddie and I will make him vanilla one day. Huh? - [Teresa] I said threw me for a loop. - Okay. I'm gonna shut that off. And you know, you don't, anytime you're using a vanilla flavoring or any kind of flavoring, you don't want your vanilla flavoring to cook because it will cook. the flavor out. Hear it? Hear that? It made it a little bit more liquidy too which I like that. Okay. So I'm gonna move back. over here to our brownie mix. I'm gonna spread this. out into our baking dish. That extra chocolate made. that real chocolatey. Doesn't it. - [Teresa] Mm-hmm - Okey doke Theresa. I dropped the dirty. - [Teresa] And I almost missed it. - I know. She's busy over there eating - [Teresa] Strawberries from. one of our earlier ones. - Yep from the strawberry tiramisu. Okay so you just wanna take your a spatula and spread that out evenly in your pan. And I'm gonna wash my wash my hands so I won't get chocolate everywhere. Okay. Now we just gonna try. to evenly spread this on top and it's going kind of. caramelize these brownies. Wanna be careful cause. that's hot and sugar hot sugar can, it can hurt. It can get real hot. So you don't wanna, you. don't wanna burn yourself. You know how hot syrups can. get when you're making candy and you have to cook it till it's a boil. Now that's some of the hottest. hot in the world right there. Okay. I'm trying to get this. So every bite somebody will. have a little bite of caramel. (pan scraping) Oh, it smells so good. That vanilla just brought it to life. Okay. So that's just that simple. So we're gonna put this in a 325 degree oven and. we're gonna cook it for what maybe 25 minutes. I can't remember what I said. - [Teresa] And this section - I do hope y'all will try. this caramelized brownie recipe because you know, it's just a nice change. It is so hot. I'm actually not gonna. be able to taste it. I mean, it's steaming hot and it's kind of gooey in the center, but as it cools, it will come right out. I don't know that it's gonna. come out though right now. I don't know. Mm. But we'll try. It's like gooey. So it cuts much better. than that y'all cool. I never tried to cut one. straight outta the oven. (blowing air) You know, every time I make brownies I would frost them with a. chocolate frosting and nuts. And like I said, I just,. you know, you get tired of making the same thing. over and over and over again. And since I did did this five days a week I just wanted to try to. change around the brownies see it's already starting. to get real firm. But if y'all were looking. for something for labor day I think you would enjoy this one. So whatever you doing y'all be safe and we send y'all love and best dishes just like every other day.
