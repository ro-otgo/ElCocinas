hey y'all welcome to paula's home cooking uh today i think we need to feed an addiction a chocolate addiction so i'm gonna be whipping up my decadent mississippi mud cake and later jamie shows me the best truffle pie you'll ever put in your mouth and how about georgia cookie candy so yummy it's like a cookie and a candy and finally a vanilla chocolate chip root beer float so grab a glass of milk and get ready to satisfy that sweet tooth why don't we start making our first dish and i've got planned for us a mississippi mud cake but in actuality the base of the cake is like a texas sheet cake what's the taste of sheet cake well it's it's where you add this balling liquid to your dry ingredients so why don't you it's a this is all a slam dunk son this is gonna be so easy all right so if you'll measure out two cups of all-purpose flour two cups of sugar i'm gonna get our liquids going here and i'm gonna bring to a ball a stick of butter [Music] a fourth of a cup of water [Music] and i'm going to measure up a half a cup of oil so you can tell by the stick of butter and the half a cup of oil that this is gonna be a real real moist cake i love wet cake i love wet cake too [Music] okay so i'm gonna add half a cup of cocoa what does that say it says one half okay so i'm gonna add a half what do that say they're so hard to read it either says one half or two once all right so i'm just gonna bring this to a bowl i love this cake it's just one of those that you just can't about screw it up so just dump everything your half a cup of buttermilk your two eggs a teaspoon of baking soda now that's baking soda not baking powder uh and about two teaspoons of your vanilla flavoring and then just dump that in there and then we'll dump this in there and uh it's gonna be cake so have you been i've been good it's just great i i've had your brother in the kitchen with me and uh i just love spending individual time with y'all did you say two teaspoons of vanilla two teaspoons of vanilla [Music] all right mine's ready and it's smelling so rich and cocoae and you're done so we're just going to dump all this into the dryer we're just going to jump it's pretty easy oh it's so simple let me get this mixed up a little bit gosh i was probably 20 21 years old when i started making this cake all right now you just pour that in there where'd you learn this from oh gosh son i can't remember my my memory is not that good you know is it a family recipe or something that you found i can't remember if a family member gave it to me or a friend but this one's been in the files a long long time let me help you yeah well i got it now but yeah you can finish finish up with that here you may want to use this on it so how's our little jack doing he's great isn't he the prettiest thing you've ever seen he's got a mouth full of teeth he's ready to eat now i know i'd probably like to get in this mississippi mud texas oh my grant you all right so we've got his first birthday coming up won't be long and um y'all have not given him really anything sweet to eat yet have you no no sugars yet no sugar and he's gonna be allowed to to dive into his birthday cake on his first birthday ethnicity yes i can't hardly wait he's gonna love it he's a dean he's gotta love it all right so it's just that simple so we've poured that into a 13 by nine by two prepared pan we greased it and floured it and so now it's going to go in the preheated oven at 350 degrees and we're going to bake it for like 25 minutes and this is going to be the best moist chocolate cake you've ever put in your mouth gonna put icing on it oh it does a fat puppy poot yes we're gonna put it uh we're gonna put a fabulous chocolate icing and look at my squirrel now what is that this man made it for me look see you pull it out and then push it in this just helps so much all right son you were asking if we were gonna put an icing on it chocolate icing yeah yeah it's like a fudge icing so to make our icing sun we're gonna i don't know if you've noticed butter but yeah this actually has two sticks of butter in it one uh just to stick in the cake and a stick in the frosting all right so so we're gonna add about three tablespoons of cocoa now i don't like a real real dark heavy chocolate i'm one of those folks that likes more of a milk chocolate so i'm going to add a fourth of a cup of milk and we're just going to let this come to a bowl and when we come back i'm going to add the sugar and what are we going to do when we get back i'm going to teach you something what you going to teach me bobby and i have come up with a truffle pie recipe that's pretty good that we got from colorado that's true sweets for the sweet oh i got the sweetest boys y'all i'm a lucky lucky chick we'll see y'all back

wonderful sweet dishes today now i'm finishing up the icing jamie for our cake now i've melted our chocolate and our butter now i'm gonna add confectioner's sugar all right i've melted the butter the cocoa now i'm just gonna add the sugar here you wanna beat that for me you know it might have been a good idea to sift it so it won't be lumpy but since i got a strong guy in the kitchen today so jamie let me get our cake out of the oven and what'd you tell me that you were gonna make bobby and i have come up with a truffle pie we went to colorado we worked it uh with a guy named william poole at wins chocolates he does beautiful chocolates we were so surprised when we got there he had truffles called the savannah truffle with uh but out there they cooked with a lot of peppers and paprika it was spicy and he put dried mangoes on top of it all right while you're telling me about that i'm just gonna pour some marshmallows all right add your cup of pecans into this icing uh-huh there you go whoa look at the mess you made my nuts are everywhere this looks good uh-huh all right now son just take that and pour that over your cake this is like a rocky road that doesn't look too bad no scrape it scrape it son all right there we go son okay now that i've got this heavy cream heated mom what i'm going to do is pour it over these six ounces of semi-sweet chips okay and i'm gonna let this melt your chocolate i'm gonna melt it down i'm gonna smooth this around son and then i'm gonna let it sit and we'll come back and taste it in a minute after that chocolate icing has uh had a chance to work on those marshmallows all right so what a good idea this is yeah the hot cream melted that chocolate uh-huh i i can taste oh yum and they're great now bobby and i would kind of do things a little bit easier so you'd make a homemade but we're using a store bought i use a lot of these but bobby and i we're kind of doing things a little bit simpler so instead of fooling with making a homemade graham cracker crust we just buy one these are so easy to use i'm going to spread this in here so see this is kind of like a pudding uh-huh but we're going into the freezer with it uh-huh now let's hope i've got room in my freezer this will only take about probably 20 minutes to set gosh that's so good and look at this so now what we've got is a solid layer it's like a piece of fudge okay mom this is the second layer and this is almost the same as the first it's a melted six ounces of semi-sweet chips it's got heavy cream in it but a little bit of vanilla what we're going to do different to this is i'm going to put it in a chill bowl and we're going to whip it to get some air in it and it's almost the same but it'll set up different i think this this layer has a little bit more heavy cream maybe than than your first layer i think so we're gonna oh that's good yeah put it in this chill bone we're just gonna pump some air into it sounds good boy this is for a real chocolate lover yep this is the real deal this would be really good for mine the bottom layer is more of a solid chocolate this center section is going to be almost like a mousse this is real real chocolaty it's a chocolate truffle pie mama is what it is and there's there's no sugar in it yet so well using the semi-sweet chips it's really ready to eat now instead of having to put a bunch of sweetener in it it's not like you were working with the cocoa so we're going to spread this out and i'm gonna wrap this up with saran wrap looks very good i'm gonna wrap this up mom and stick it into the fridge for overnight okay while you're doing that i'm gonna cut us a piece of our cake that's been kind of sitting here doing its thing look at those marshmallows they've melted yum look at this y'all i'm swallowing hard look at that wet cake come on mom i enjoy wet cake you want to share yourself with me not really with melted marshmallows [Music] we need some milk when you put that in the freezer grab us a glass of milk and i'm gonna clean up when we come back i'm gonna be making a georgia cookie candy i'm gonna finish this truffle pie too y'all stick around and later a vanilla

we're going to start by throwing in to our food processor a cup of butter that's been allowed to come to room temperature while you're doing that i'm going to measure a out of peanut butter i'm just gonna give that a little squirt so that peanut butter will come out easily i see your sifter you want me to finish this yeah i've got three cups of confectioners sugar and i'm measuring out one cup of crunchy peanut butter y'all and i like the crunchy cause it just gives you a little snap all right so see how easy that peanut butter came out of there jamie because i sprayed it so all you have to do son is dump your sugar in there and we're just gonna run this through the food processor [Music] all right so there we go all we're gonna do just let it let it smooth up this is going to be kind of
