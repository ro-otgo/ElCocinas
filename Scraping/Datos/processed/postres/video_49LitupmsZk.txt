hey y'all welcome to the kitchen today I want to read John quickly a sweet note I got from this is she sounds like a young woman dear Polly you brought me much joy with your quarantine cooking during this heartbreaking time I input data all day so I can listen to news etc when I am at the verge of tears I click on your videos and your wonderful laugh makes me smile thank you for being you PS could you please make a chocolate cream pie with the white fluffy crust lari lari Lorraine look I can't talk that Sibelius Lorraine Larry Lorraine Laurie that so sweet and honey I'm gonna make you a chocolate pie with that white crust and by white crust I think you mean meringue so I'm gonna show you the chocolate cream pie that I've made for years in fact it's in my cookbook Paula Dean's kitchen classics book oh look I use this one so much it's coming apart but I love this book so gets used a lot so this was it's an easy recipe because you don't have to stop and temper your eggs into your hot pudding so all we gonna do is mix together our dry ingredients and that's a cup of sugar and I think let's see three tablespoons of cocoa powder and two tablespoons of flour and that flour is gonna make this thick for us so you just want to take your whisk and whisk that all together and the results are almost like you sifted it so you want to break up those chunks of flour and the cocoa so that's mixed up real good step Milo's okay so we're gonna add two cups of milk and we want to do this fairly slow because if you just jump it it might have a tendency to to get lumpy Anya I love this I love this pot it's the first time I've ever used it not and I look down it says Dean brothers I knew it was a cookware that had just been shipped to me recently my boys did good it's a great great little pot alright so I'm gonna finish stirring those in and you can see I've got some butter not nearly enough butter I don't know what was wrong with me that day then I just said one tablespoon of butter and vanilla flavoring over here but we're gonna put that in after we've finished cooking our pudding all right so I'm gonna add the the three egg yolks and this is gonna help it thicken and it's gonna make that custard very rich tasting then normally most of the recipes that you find Laurie you temper your hot custard into your egg yolks and by tempering I mean we would have I get egg yolks here and then we would take hot custard and slowly mix it in with those yolks so we wouldn't have scrambled eggs so we just don't mix of yolks right in there just like this thing because it's gonna be slowly getting hot they won't be lumpy and if you want me some days you just don't want to fool with making your own pie crust so we have used a frozen with but this sound be better Eddie for me - that's good alright so I'm gonna turn this to like a medium sized and you want to whisk this about the whole time Laurie because it would stick or scorching you don't want all that to happen take my spatula and just get all that down from the side and you see that that egg just disappeared right in there so this is gonna take a few minutes but it could get hot and bubbly and when it gets thick and hot and bubbly I'm gonna take it off and I'm going to pour it into another bowl and I'm gonna add my butter in my vanilla and stir that in and then I'm gonna take a piece of wax paper or clear plastic wrap and I'm gonna Pat it down where it's touching my pudding so that way you're putting on formal crust and it will remain very very smooth when you get ready to put it into your already baked pie crust okay that well how long did I cook that it's supposed to be cooked on low but I could cooked it on like medium y'all and it may be to six or seven minutes not long bb-baby no and it's nice and thick and it's piping hot so I'm gonna pour that in a bowl and I'm gonna get every last drop out then it smell delicious and we've got a deep-dish shale I like deep dishes alright so I'm gonna add a vanilla flavoring and our butter and some butter 1 tablespoon it's not enough y'all been feeling puny that day alright so I'm just gonna stir that in until the butter melts mmm and now I'm fixing to cover it piece of plastic I'm going all the way down so it's laying on top of the custard because custard has a tendency to get a hard crust on it but if you seal off all the air and we'll be able to take that off and it will still be a nice soft consistency so I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator I'm gonna have to leave y'all again one more time I'm gonna let this cool and then we're gonna put it in our pie crust and then I'm gonna show y'all how easy it is to make Swiss meringue and you're gonna want to make Swiss meringue when you ain't got a pie in sight just gonna neat that Swiss meringue okay y'all it's time to make our Swiss meringue and I promise you that if you ever make a Swiss meringue you won't want regular meringue ever again this is I guess it would help the turtle nice go great time of day Oh so Swiss meringue it consists of six egg whites and one and a half cups of sugar and that's it now I don't know where my double baller went so I'm using a glass bowl and I've got just enough water and then you go with some water touching your bowl so don't fill it with a whole bunch of water in fact test it and make sure suit your bowl on top of your water and make sure it doesn't touch so this is very very much like seven in icing y'all so you just you just beat this and stir it until it's 140 degrees you know what I'm almost thinking I might change Theresa would you get me like oh one little little one the bigger pots out there over there in the cabinet I wanted to do this and right or the left it's like a small Dutch oven yes perfect I think this bowl let me check and see this bowl is almost too big for this for this pot so let's see if that'll know that bowl was too big for that little the top of my saucepan so I got me a bigger saucepan in a bigger bowl and I have gotten a make-your-own seven so as I was saying this is I want like 7-minute icing y'all 7-minute icing you cook for seven minutes but I don't think that's gonna take seven minutes for this now when you're doing this over your stove you can't forget your cord getting Paul into your five darling I was making 7-minute icing one day and I had to stop and do something else and I honest darling and I said would you just come continue people this for me and she's a brilliant girl she's so smart I looked around and she had left the cord go down into fire and flames Oh get out of my kitchen girl if you want to do some with a computer she can do anything but nope give her a fine thing it's hard to believe that just egg whites and sugar can make this incredible there's some of the tree and you want this to cook over boiling water down not simmering but following our chocolate pudding it should be cool enough now we can pour that into our earth crust oh you know you know you bring girl starting to look good and one other thing you'll want your egg whites at room temperature to make sure you separate your eggs earlier [Applause] I'm this better with my training hundred and forty Sharif very high temperature get close yeah it's just amazing gradients is a beautiful thing I can't jump so good bad for us [Applause] sorry adj I get you I'm gonna see what this will register I think it's there thank you I think oh gosh y'all nice up good I wish you were here too late but a bigger oh I say it's rigged and I don't know how many minutes that took it yeah well you started so I mean you're probably out of nine minute icing right well I kind of mucked up I never used that size pot to do my double boiler cooking I don't know what I was thinking maybe I wasn't thinking oh this is gonna be so good hmm I do think though in the written recipe it called for two tablespoons of flour but I really think you might need so you know how when you make a regular meringue tile you have to put it in the oven and and cook it off until the tips are brown well the Swiss meringue you don't have to do that I actually if you have a kitchen torch you can use your kitchen torch and just brown the tips I'm telling you and I listen I like to use every bit of it Therese you will eat the bone the bone [Music] so we just want to see all that that meringue onto the crust cuz you don't want you don't want any chocolate showing how beautiful is that in that beautiful and I just kind of take it and do like that just swirl it and then kind of do like that or you can do it smooth whatever your eye and your belly likes in that delicious all right so my kitchen tour child is out of juice so this is one of Michael's high-powered liners it's not burning is it baby it was yep it is now what I think you could hold they don't start it well the D yet I call myself doing that but then it goes out so Michaels not up here so but last time I made a Swiss meringue I used it with one of his torch lighter I said he uses faces cigars but it doesn't even have to have that it's beautiful just like that okay y'all I couldn't get Michaels cigar torch to work too good which reminds me I needed to stuff up my real kitchen torch Eddie help me remember Theresa helped me remember but anyway Eddie finally got it to work long enough to just do some little brown tips but we just remembered we had a partial eaten solid chocolate Easter Bunny so Eddie grated that on top so it don't need no more torching I'm gonna torch it with these right here honey I'm gonna torch the heck out of it I wish you were here to help me love and best dishes y'all have a grand day
