[Music] well I promised y'all a wonderful recipe for a chocolate cookie didn't I well let's get started on it I've got two sticks of butter that are room temperature here in my bowl I'm gonna add a half a cup of light brown sugar I'm gonna add one cup of granulated sugar and let's just beat that until it's nice and creamy all right so this is nice and creamy I've got four eggs all right I'm gonna add one egg at the time turn that up a little bit and just cream cream okeydoke now I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla now I'm gonna measure out our flour we're gonna need two and a half cups of flour for our cookie there we go that's one two and a half and I'm gonna add 1/3 of a cup of Dutch process cocoa powder and one teaspoon of baking powder now I'm just gonna incorporate these dry ingredients and I'm gonna beat them in to our creamed butter okay a little bit more I'm gonna do this in like three different additions rather than dumping it in and all at one time and flower flying all up in my face I'm gonna slowly add this and the last of our dry ingredients okay I got our beater it's pretty clean I've got one more ingredient to add to them and that's just something that us girls can't resist this is chocolate y'all that's filled with a raspberry cream now I'm using one six ounce bag and I'm gonna fold those in to our batter I mean chocolate and raspberries they just go together so this batter is wonderful all you got to do is put it on a greased baking sheet a teaspoonful put it in a preheated 350 degree oven and cook it for 12 to 14 minutes and then you want to set them out on a rack and let them cool and I've got some down here cooling for us so in my bowl I've got one and a half cups of confectioner's sugar and I'm gonna pour in two tablespoons of milk and I'm sure you've guessed by now we're gonna make a glaze for this wonderful chocolate raspberry cookie now all we're gonna do at this point is add one tablespoon of a seedless raspberry preserve now this will make it nice and smooth mmm so we're just gonna keep those flavors going from the inside of that cookie to the outside and you can see it that glaze looked awfully thick until I added the raspberry preserves and you can see how they thinned it out that it's just bright just to just squirt it on top of that cookie all right now I'm gonna transfer this to a plastic baggie just gonna pour it in seal it up snip that end and you don't want to make too big of a hole and then we're just gonna squeeze this glaze under our cookies you [Music] you
