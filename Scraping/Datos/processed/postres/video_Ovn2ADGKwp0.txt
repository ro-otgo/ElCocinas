hey y'all I'm Paula Deen and you know not all foods look as good as they taste and I happen to call those foods grub food and on today's show my sons Jamie and Bobby are gonna be helping me fix a grub fest we're gonna be starting with my barbecue meatloaf that's packed full of sweet and tangy flavor and then we're gonna move on to Wayne's beefy macaroni and cheese yeah beef and cheese just doesn't get much better than that and last but not least is my banana split cake it's so sugary and sweetened so y'all want to grab plenty of napkins and maybe even a bib cause it's time by a drug fest you gonna be all about grubbing and grub food and to me grub food is is just real honest food food that just tastes good that everybody across America likes and course to me there's no grub food like a meatloaf a barbecue meatloaf so I'm gonna start with a pound and a half of ground beef and a half a cup of tomato sauce and I'm gonna move this over here because that's gonna go in the sauce that we're gonna top our meatloaf with I'm gonna add a cup of breadcrumbs and these are fresh breadcrumbs I'm gonna add one diced onion and Gertie's sticking close to me this morning y'all she loves meatloaf so we're gonna add one egg and then salt and pepper and just do this to taste and we're just gonna mix those ingredients together Michael fusses at me because you know he worked hard to buy this ring and to see me getting food on in it just kills him but I just feel so much better about them being on my fingers I just rather have them dirty and on my fingers than clean and lost you know but a second I'm gonna have to take them off so I can really get in here alright so I'm just gonna take our meatloaf and put it into our baking dish and I want to make sure he's nice and compact in there so he won't have a bunch of cracks all right now we're gonna make our sauce and our sauce is gonna be a little bit on the sweet side to our tomato sauce I'm gonna start by adding the Worcestershire sauce the brown sugar the Dijon mustard the vinegar now we're just gonna pour this over our meatloaf YUM all right so we're gonna put this in a 350 degree preheated oven and we're gonna let it bake for an hour alright I've got that meatloaf in the oven and remember about every 15 minutes we're gonna go to that oven and spoon that sauce on top of that meatloaf and keep it basted for the entire hour that it's baking but in the meantime y'all I've got another one you know around my house I can't do anything in small amounts I have to have a lot of whatever I'm cooking because not only now do I have my two sons I've got another son and another daughter and I got a niece and I got a brother and I got their friends there's always somebody to feed in our house look at this I get

mayonnaise what a sandwich hey boys oh that looks good I think I have a sandwich now oh one for sure I guess you won't so guys I forgot to get the bananas for the banana split cake so guess who's doing the next segment what do you cook him off Wayne's beefy Mac y'all be fine you can do it so I guess it's uh I guess it is all right then so next on the Jamie and Bobby's home cooking show Wayne's beefy macaroni sounds good does sound good as we wait for Paula so stay tuned and we'll be right back to the Bobby and Jamie show [Music] [Music] welcome back y'all and do not adjust your televisions this is Paula's home cookin you believe we are out of bananas and moms had to go out and pick some up so we're taking over this segment we're gonna do Wayans beefy macaroni this comes from a friend of mom's up in Maryland his name is Wayne so first thing we're gonna do is start with a skillet we're gonna put a couple squirts of some vegetable oil down here I guess what we should do first is we got a pot of boiling water yeah one box of elbow macaroni I'm gonna put my fresh garlic down in this pan and now I see Jamie this is this is a variation of one of my favorite things that mom cook she used to make a homemade goulash for me but I see that some of the ingredients are different and I know that you're familiar with Wayne's recipe and I'm really not so tell me what you want me to do and how to help you well this is the main ingredient of a lot of our recipes and this is a sauteed fresh garlic onion and bell pepper and we're gonna cook this until it's soft if you want to stir this Bobby alright well I'm gonna put some salt down in our macaroni first we forgot to do that I mean I don't want compare it but similar to like that lasagna basically Bobby all it is is a goulash recipe that we're gonna put in a casserole dish don't cover it with cheese and bake it off that looks pretty good Bob okay so we're done here go ahead and pull this off now we're gonna leave your pan there I'm just gonna take this stuff out and then I'm gonna get you to brown the hamburger meat huh I'm just gonna Brown this like we were making a lasagna spaghetti pretty standard stuff anytime I'm doing any cooking with beef I always always Psalm that Brit can't get can't hurt it well when do we do that do we do that while it's in the bowl or do we drop it in there and begin to brown it and then season well this is warming back up let's do it this way just put a little bit of salt in here and that way once you get in the pan you can just concentrate on cooking it all right back up I'm your little brother what I can do this okay maybe Brown that hamburger meat off are those noodles born the noodles are boiling you go just brown that off might want to turn that down a little bit so you don't get grease splatter on you looks like the noodles are done I'm gonna drain those you want to go ahead and get everything seasoned yeah do you want to do this now or are we gonna combine everything after a branch a wide range that's almost brown we'll strain that grease off of there okay before we season it up it's a hot pot Jamie's got more experience than I do Jamie was working in restaurants well before I was the first restaurant I ever worked in actually belonged to my mom so my cooking skills are still a work in progress so to speak and I like to get in the kitchen with Jamie anytime I can cuz I can I can always learn from him how many years has it been now Jen that you've been cooking for mom in a week it'll be 16 years hard to believe the thing about it is that Bobby is that everybody that cooks I mean you'll always there's always more to learn but it's something that you just keep doing and you always some people come in and say gosh it it looks so simple and you make it look so simple but it's just the knowledge that you're armed with is what makes it look simple okay this is some oregano by we're gonna put some dried oregano in here and we've got some basil this is my favorite anyone else you got some cumin over here yeah cumin is what gives it the really distinct flavor right I'd love to put cumin in my chili okay Bobby let's put those canned crushed tomatoes in okay and three cups of cans recutting yes you shouldn't act like I've cooked a lot longer than you have you and I were there with mom when we started well no I mean I've been cooking with mom and with you and at home for you know better than better than 20 years now but as far as the experience is concerned I mean cooking in restaurants for selling food yeah you know I've been I've been using people as guinea pigs for over 20 years I couldn't have been selling that well still I'm still learned so we're gonna do now is we're just gonna add all this delicious stuff onto this macaroni and give it a big turn let's see I hope this bow is big enough oh this smells so good I just love meat and pasta and this is so close to my favorite the goulash that mom used to making it's so simple you know it's just like everything that mom does that's what I was saying it's all about what you're familiar with you know I bring that over here Jamie I'll hold your bowl if you want to scrape that off into your casserole dish there we lightly grease this so it wouldn't stick too bad so we're just gonna cover the top with cheese and at 350 everything's done on the inside so we just want to melt this cheese real good so it's about 2 cups because this is a pretty full casserole I've got your oven its own at 350 so if you want to drop that in there then that looks good and because Paula's home cooking is my favorite show on television and I know how she does it we have one already ready practically screams grub faster good great and that's something that looks wonderful should we test it I think so so yeah give coming it looks great yeah see how good all that comes together in there yeah and you see what I mean when I say that this Vermont reminds me of like a baked lasagna mm hmm hmm man is that good I don't go away coz when we come back mom will be back with the bananas for the banana split cake Jamie thank you for the lesson Wayne thank you this is spectacular [Music] [Music] okay guys I'm back with the bananas how'd it go how'd y'all do yeah we have fun that's a simple recipe Paula's home cooking is still no longer the next dish that we're gonna do it's just a banana split cake but I have to tell y'all this is one of those recipes that I've always had a lot of calls on because of the controversy of the raw egg in the dish and this dish doesn't get cooked and you know I'm just not afraid of raw eggs as long as they're nice and tight in their shell no cracks and they hadn't expired but for those of you out there that might have an issue with that you can use a pasteurized egg in place of it and then that way you have no worries at all Jamie why don't you start by making a crust to my favorite things graham cracker crumbs and butter it's about 4 cups of graham cracker crumbs and then just stick of butter and we're gonna do a little something different the recipe doesn't call to stick this crust in the oven but I like what heat does to this it makes it kind of hard and in form more like a a hard crust so we're just gonna press this into our dish and we're gonna stick it in the oven for like five to eight minutes and pull it out and let it cool so while you're doing that I'm gonna slice the bananas and Bobby you want to go ahead and make the filling side yeah I'm gonna start with two sticks of butter and I'm gonna go ahead and begin to cream that I'm gonna add two eggs beat two eggs into this as well and I'm gonna add in a box one one-pound box of powdered sugar all right James son if you want to go ahead and get that in the dish and get it in the oven we're gonna put that in a 350 degree oven I said for about five to eight minutes just gonna harden up and Bobby how are you coming over there son perfectly alright Jamie I've got another one in the oven if you would go ahead and get it out please cuz we want to make sure it's cool we don't want to put this together while it's hot you know Bobby it's funny you've never had any cooking experience like Jamie had you really had you in sales yeah well I got my experience trial trial by fire I really wanted you to join us and you did you quit your salesman's job and you came over and you became the dishwasher I've been working out for you taking me so far and then you were promoted yeah all the dessert the pastry shell and I got really good at it never got bored with it but I really got no not at all and I've always you know growing up with you or growing up in your house rather no I always enjoyed cooking but I didn't really get the joy of once I started cooking for people and getting their reaction from it that's what I really started to enjoy to me there's nothing like our job granted it's hard hard work you really put yourself on the line out there you really opened yourself up for shots but if you're good at what you do there's nothing like that immediate gratification that we get from walking out on the floor and people saying oh my goodness you know I just love your food see one looks on their face that looks so good and buttery Jamie you know it's not the easiest thing in the world to spread mm-hmm alright so what we're gonna do now son I'm just gonna spread this bananas all over and then we're gonna top our bananas with the canned crushed pineapple that's been very very well drained all right I'm gonna top this now you can use a frozen whipped topping but y'all know when I'm making these kind of desserts that I only use one thing in that sweet and fresh cream all right so that was just that simple and now we're just gonna top it with a few graham cracker crumbs that an ad from Jamie's crust and that looks yummy mm-hmm and you got dishes yes oh this looks so good gonna fix the dish mom well I think I'm just gonna try is it good - really good I think I'm gonna try just a bite I love the pineapple in it I do tuna pineapple really makes it to you my darling and to the part you played into all the desserts that we serve at the lady and sons I think I'm the reason for your success here for you Bobby mister me that's really good mmm you know I think I'm gonna have to take a break and when we come back I'm gonna share with you a great grubbing tip many BLTs you're not gonna believe how simple easy and delicious they are so I'm gonna find a wash rag for the boys and I'll see you back here in just a second [Music] you [Music] has your husband ever brought home unexpected company with them what are you gonna feed them you need a quick little appetizer something that will fill them up well I've got just the trick for you because there's a good chance that you have all these items in your refrigerator all you're gonna need is lettuce bacon tomatoes mayonnaise and sour cream and of course some kind of chip and most all of us keep these things in our house at all times all you want to do is shred your lettuce mix your sour cream and your mayonnaise together two of my favorite condiments love sour cream we're gonna just mix those two items together quickly put those in the center of our container just pile our lettuce up around it top it with Tomatoes top it with bacon stick our chips around it and everybody can step up to the table and make them a little mini BLT and you're out of the woods girl I think grubbing and grubbing food may have just moved to my number one favorite category and what about my little stars here your beefy mac this was very very good and it's a banana split cake over the top one of my favorites but y'all got to please promise me that you will make this barbecue meatloaf and make you a meatloaf sandwich but I'm so proud of y'all thanks mom well thanks we enjoyed doing your show thank you it was a pleasure well I tell you what I think it's time for us to go
