- Hey, y'all. You know how much I. love hearing from y'all, the good and the bad and the ugly. I love hearing from you. And you know, I'm constantly saying, now, send me a recipe that was. your favorite in your family. And when y'all do that, I just love getting 'em. and reading over 'em. Well, this recipe today is from Callie Dycus. D-Y-C-U-S. And do we know where she's from? Oh. From Arkansas. - [Theresa] Arkansas. - So she says, "Hey, Paula, I'm from Arkansas. And this Doodle Cake was. always a summer staple that my grandma made. I'm not sure where the. silly name came from, but it is so easy, and I. think everybody will love it." So. Callie, how can you. not love a "dump cake"? Which is what this is. So, I've got two cups. of all-purpose flour, two cups of white sugar. And I'm just gonna whisk our. dry ingredients together. I've got one teaspoon of baking soda and a fourth a teaspoon of salt. I don't get that. That little bit, I wouldn't think would make. a whole lot of difference. But by using... a whisk on it, it's almost like sifting, 'cause it breaks it all up and just mixes your dry. ingredients real good. So, the next thing we're gonna do is add one can, and I think 20-ounce... Yeah. A 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple. And I'm not... Juice and all, Callie say. So I'm not even gonna. use the mixer on this. I'm just gonna stir, stir. And Callie says to mix it well. This kind of reminds me of one of my "better than sex" cakes. (Theresa chuckling) Depends on how old you are, Susan. (Paula chuckling) - [Susan] I'm turning the. big seven-oh this year. - Are you? Well, I did that five years ago. - [Susan] Oh! You know where I'm at then. - I know where you're at. So 70 is the new 50. (Paula laughing) - [Susan] I like that. - What is 75 the new? 60. I'll take 60. (Paula and Susan chuckling) All right. So, how easy was this. cake to put together? I mean, it doesn't even. call for vanilla icing. I mean, vanilla flavoring. All-righty. So I'm gonna put this in our prepared 13" by 9" by 2" pan. And when I say "prepared," that means it's been sprayed and ready to greet the ingredients. All right, so, Callie,. you tell me to put this in a 350-degree oven, preheated, for 30 to 35 minutes, so that's what I'm gonna do! Okay, our... What is this? What is this cake called? Doodle. - [Theresa] Doodle Cake! - Doodle Cake. (Paula laughing) And thank you, Callie, for. sending us this recipe. I'm melting the butter now, because Callie says to frost this cake... It says it comes outta the oven. So, I'm melting my sugar. I mean, I'm melting my butter. And then I'm gonna add... Was this one can, Theresa, or... - [Theresa] It's two-thirds cup. - Okay. But it's- - [Theresa] So, no. It's not a can. - It's not a can.. - [Theresa] No. - Okay. We're using two-thirds of a cup of sweetened condensed milk. So I'm gonna pour that in. You know, you could... (Paula chuckling) You could put sweetened condensed milk on things that birds leave, and I swear it'd be good. (Paula chuckling) It just makes everything better. Look at that butter. You see that butter melting into that? Oh my goodness. This is gonna be so good. All right, let's see. She doesn't tell us to. poke holes in it, does she? - [Theresa] No, and that's. what I was wondering too, but it just seems like. it must sink into it. - You know what? I may just hit it with a... with the end of a spoon, a circular spoon. All right. I just added one cup of sugar, two-thirds a cup of. sweetened condensed milk, one stick of butter, and then I'm gonna add one cup of coconut, shredded coconut, and one teaspoon of vanilla. And it said, "melt butter,. then add sugar and milk. Boil for three minutes. Remove from heat and. add vanilla and coconut and spread on cake while hot." I shoulda had this done a few minutes ago. Right? 'Cause that cake is cooling as we speak. So this is what I'm gonna do. We'll have to find the right spoon. Okay, this is right. It has a round... I'm just gonna poke a few holes just to make sure. Oh my gosh, look how moist that is. Holy ka-moly. I'm not gonna do many, 'cause it is... delicious. Look, it's got nice and thick. So now I'm gonna add our coconut, and that was one cup. That's boiling good. All right. And now our vanilla. And I know I've told y'all about my newest product for the store is this wonderful,. wonderful vanilla extract. And it's... It's so incredible. I might not even be making my. own vanilla flavoring anymore. - [Eddie] Well, we just did a giveaway, where you gave away-. - Yes, we did do a giveaway. - [Eddie] Like, peppermint.. - Did we hear from peo- - [Eddie] Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah. - Okay, here we go. I wish our cake was a little bit hotter. I dropped the ball on that one. Mm. Wow. I am glad I put a few holes in it. Maybe it'll catch a little bit of that. Awesome in the summer. This looks wonderful. Like a pineapple cake with cooked icing on top. (spoon knocking against dish) Pieces of brown in there where the butter was starting. to turn brown for us. I like that, Callie. I like seeing that. See? That's from the butter. - [Theresa] Did you get all of it? - [Paula] I got all of it. Best I could. Sister. - [Theresa] I'm always. scared to pull your- - [Paula] Oh, yeah. Oh, my little Davis. Ow! That is hot icing. My little Davis comes into my kitchen, Jamie and Brooks. Third little boy. And he says, (Paula patting her stomach) "Giggi? Hot cake? Hot cake?" (Paula patting her stomach) I could squeeze his little head off. By "hot cake" he means a cake that's got birthday candles lit in it. (Theresa chuckling) So to him, that's a "hot cake." I think it's cute. (water running) All right. Should we cut a little piece? Or should we wait? She doesn't say. So. I'm gonna cut it. I went and grabbed me a small paper plate. That way, I'm not as. tempted to cut a big piece. You know what I mean? (knife clicking against dish) Oh. Holy ka-moly! Every bit of that on my plate. Oh, it's coming out so good. Mm. Y'all get y'all a fork. Oh, my goodness. The icing is like... Almost... Not chewy's the word, but... Mm! It just has substance to it, (water running) for lack of a better word. Theresa, get your fork, honey- - [Theresa] Lent, baby. - And bring- - [Theresa] No sweets for me. - Huh? Oh! She's in Lent. You know... - [Theresa] So make Eddie. - I'm Baptist, and that's working out. pretty good for me right now. (Paula chuckling) Whoa. Callie, thank you so much, honey, for sharing your grandmother's recipe with the rest of us, because it's out of this world. And so easy to make. Thank you, Callie.
