I told you we're gonna make something that was new you seen the chip which is like they have in the grocery store the little ice-cream sandwiches that have Oh Lord yes I make them I make them for my kids we decided we were gonna make one with molasses cookies and a bacon sort of ice cream on the inside of us bacon ice cream well let me let me show you what I'm fixing to do Kevin I didn't have any stop I'm gonna cheat and use this crazy pad I'm not gonna tell our show and I think people are gonna find out so I think it's okay to cheat now and then I wouldn't do it on a regular basis so I threw a cup and a half of sugar in here just white sugar and then this whole stick of butter here yes yes [Music] orders up a cup of cake flour and then I'm gonna get right here this man this is bread flour I'm gonna have a bread flour why do you do that bread flours got a lot of gluten you know so it's to here and I like the molasses cookies really chewy I'm gonna add some baking soda to this it's about two teaspoons of baking soda uh-huh and now this is the part that you kind of eyeball here is your spices cuz it's about what you preferred I like yeah so we'll use almost a whole tablespoon of ginger nice and spicy it is gonna bake we got some clove and some cinnamon and I think you want to bow it is strong these are strong cookies but once you mix them with the other stuff exactly we know we actually make them in fancy words it's a semifreddo so it's like yeah it's like frozen mousse see you chefs I don't once you get it mixed up like this where it's kind of soft and granular we're gonna mix in like about a third of a cup of molasses to it stick right up put some eggs right here did you crack me one up and throw it right on there just one one one egg this is the part where the mess comes mm-hmm put in the flour all of it one time now the key here is to not let this thing take off at full blast otherwise the kitchen will be covered in flour I kind of already look like Casper but yeah we'll look a little bit more like Casper yeah you did you're very creamy exactly me white [Music] you can see I got some of these balls right here I'm telling you them some good Roma Roman sugar you can only get about six of them on a sheet tray because they're gonna spread out a whole bunch so how they are yeah well I throw them in the oven here in a minute they're gonna go about 375 depending on how hot your oven is you might have to go up a little bit or down a little bit but the thing is and this is where people screw up this recipe is that you don't let it cook until they're crispy look like pork tenderloin is perfect that is delicious yeah that's really good in that yummy you open that door for fried corn Tommy what you talking about four minutes we'll come back we'll check on my spin him around we'll be good to go have a 4-minute cookie what is this that's bacon bacon yes ma'am I'm gonna grab that semifreddo that we've made up okay and bring it over here we can make some of these sandwiches oh my gosh Kevin my husband I don't want to marry you I'm already spoken for but he loves these kind of cookies I love junk food and I'm always trying to find ways to recreate it and so I took my old fashioned molasses cookie recipe that I also got from my granny and we made a caramel and bacon ice cream to go on the inside of our chip which there you go all right I'm gonna can I cut this into okay I'm gonna make another one oh okay right give us another one Kevin Kevin Kevin what do you think mmm that bacon on my ice cream in those cookies was incredible is this how you serve it at the restaurant a bowl of bacon or you know sometimes we'll roll the sides in it make the sides be covered in bacon most the time at the restaurant we made these a little bit smaller than this most people in a nice kind of fancy restaurant don't like to manhandle [Music] you
