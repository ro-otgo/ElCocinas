- Hey friends. It is so stinking hot here in Savannah. So hot. But you know what? I heard that there's a heat. wave across the country that like the Midwest is. breaking records for heat. You know I'm so thankful. that Bobby lives on the water and with us living here. in his guest house, we're on the water also and. that creates a little breeze. So I'm ever so thankful for that. But having said that, it is summertime, and all of the wonderful. delicious fruits are coming in. And the triplets adore, adore fruit. I've got mango, I've got honeydew, kiwi, blackberries, strawberries,. and blueberries. Now I was given. instructions to teach y'all, if you don't know how, to cut a mango. Because you know, it's. got that huge seed in it. So I called in the expert. this morning, Claudia, because her children adore. mangoes, especially Olivia. So I said I really need an expert today on helping me teach folks how. to properly slice a mango. So she is gonna be here in a little while, she couldn't come right then. But so while I'm waiting on her, I'm gonna make a sweet, creamy custard for dipping our fruit. in while we're waiting on Claud to get here. And all I need for that. is milk, eggs, and sugar. So it's really gonna be like, almost like a vanilla. pudding to dip it in. I'm gonna start with a. cup and a half of milk. And I think if I remember correctly, like a half a cup of. sugar, let me check, y'all. I don't want to, 2/3, tell you wrong. Yes, 2/3 of a cup of sugar. And we are gonna heat this up. Now we don't want it to boil. We never want this to boil. And you need to stir it. pretty like, almost always. All right, I've got two, four,. six eggs here, six yolks. And I'm gonna (fork. clinking) beat those up. And then we're gonna temper our yolks with our hot milk and sugar mixture. And then we're gonna be adding our vanilla and a little butter. And naturally we have to let this cool. And I always serve the. dressing on the side, because some of you may want. it and some of you may not. So you can serve yourself on that. Now this is probably gonna. take it about 10 minutes. I've got it on a low temperature, so it'll take about 10 minutes probably, for this to this heat up and then we'll be ready. to temper our egg yolks. Okay, our sugar has dissolved. So now we're just gonna add a little bit and you see, it's not boiling. We don't want it to boil. So we're gonna slowly. add the hot to the yolks. Otherwise, if you just poured. the yolks right in there, they could curdle, and it'd. be like scrambled eggs. So you gonna add a little bit more, and just beat them each time. you add a little of your hot. Okay, so those are nice and warm now. So we're gonna pour it into. our milk and sugar mixture, just like that. Anytime you're making a cream. pie or anything like that, that's the way you'll want to. add your eggs to the recipe. Like I said, you can't. just put 'em in there, or you might get scrambled. eggs in your custard. So now we're gonna cook this until it begins to thicken some. Okay y'all, it took about 10 minutes. It's slightly thickened and it. coats the back of the spoon. When it coats the back of your spoon, then you know it's ready. So we're gonna add our butter and about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. And we're gonna stir that together. And then we gonna let it cool. And by the time this cools, Claudia should be. walking in the back door, to teach us how to properly cut a mango. So I got a kick out of. when Ms. Theresa told me that she wanted an expert to show y'all how to slice, peel, and slice a mango. Well I hate to tell you,. but I'm not the expert. And I'll tell you why. Because I know it's got. a huge seed in the center and they're expensive, they can be pricey. They're not right now. 'cause there in season. They're like a buck apiece. at the grocery store now. So I never would buy a mango. But I've seen Claud peel and. de-pit a mango so many times, because Olivia loves a mango. - Mm-hmm. - So- - Here's the expert. - I laughed, yes.. - The mango expert. - So the expert is my. daughter-in-law, Claud. Do they grow these in your home country? - Yes.. - Okay. - So at my grandma's house,. they had huge mango tree and- - Really?. - Yes, it was crazy. And they're the best mangoes. All these are usually imported. from, like, Mexico, I feel. - Yeah, yeah. - But in Latin America and South. America it's, it's amazing. And I remember at the school too, and when the trees would be packed. Like they'll let the. kids bring mango, yeah. - Oh, that's great. Well, I had a feeling the. way I've seen you handle 'em. (Claudia laughing) That they must be native. to where you grew up. - Yes, yes, and these. remind me of my daddy. My daddy loves mangoes. - Does he?. - He does. - All right, now I've picked. - And they're delicious, I love them too.. - I picked out a couple of knives, and I hope one of 'em. is sharp enough for you. - Well, we're gonna see-. - So let me know. And if it's not-. - We'll get another. - Now do you start off by washing them? - Yeah, so I don't, I'm no. expert, but I'll do my best. - All right, and I've got, compared to me, you're an expert. - Okay, let's put it that way. but, no expert.. - There's different standards. - Well, now, I didn't used to. wash my fruit that had peels, but Bobby told me a crazy. story that he read online. I think I told you that, too. Of somebody that ate an. avocado without washing it, like cut it, and they ate it. And there was like some. bacteria on the skin, and then that person died. - So after that I wash everything. - I've never heard that story, and I've never washed an avocado. - Wash them, wash them. I'll even wash my lemons now.. - Never. - And I wash them with. like water and vinegar, so. - Yes.. - But this will do. - And you've got a machine that's like, you can put your fruits and. your veggies to sterilize them. - To sterilize everything, yeah. So okay. - All right, so first of. all, we've got 'em washed. Now I would like for you to. tell us how to select a mango. - Oh. - I don't know when they're ripe. - Well, it's funny because. sometimes you think like this is really red. and you'll feel like, because it's really red, it's ready, but it's all by feel. So it's like a lemon, you know? You want it to be a little. bit squishy, squishy, squidgy. - Yeah, this one's not squishy. - It's not very squishy, but it's fine. - No, let me check this one.. It's like an avocado, too, like a lemon or an avocado. - Like an avocado, yes. I know how to select a avocado. - So it's about the same.. - That's much the same way. - Yeah, and usually like I'll get, if I get three for the week for Oli, I'll get one that is harder, to give it time like an avocado.. - Right, right. - Like a banana. - Yes. - And remind me, before you leave today, I've got all that fruit. that I wanna give you that I'm afraid is gonna go to waste. - Yeah. - It won't go to waste in my house. So this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna cut and this. is all gonna be by feel, because we don't know. where the pit is, right? So you're just gonna cut, I'm gonna say like. third, like a third way. - [Paula] A third of the way. - [Claudia] Yeah. - [Paula] You gonna try to. get a solid piece of meat. - [Claudia] Yes, but. see, I can feel the pit. - [Paula] You can? - [Claudia] No, I cannot. - [Paula] You cannot. (Claudia laughing) - [Claudia] It's a mango that is hard. That's the pit. - [Paula] Okay yes, yes. - [Claudia] So you're gonna. try to do that with every side. But again, it's got, the softer the mango is the easier it is, because you'll feel the hard. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Claudia] Like I can. feel that thing there, so let's go this way. (knife cutting) So maybe this way. I'm gonna have to go a little sideways, but it's fine. Yeah, this mango is not quite ready. - It's not quite a mango, is it? - No, you wanna go as close. to the pit as you can. - [Paula] As you can. - [Claudia] I could have gone closer here. - [Paula] Yes. - [Claudia] Of course the. edges are gonna be smaller. You're gonna have two. big pieces in one small. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Claudia] So the trick is gonna be, kind of like what you. may do with an avocado, is that you're gonna do squares. - [Paula] Just like an avocado. - [Claudia] Yes. So you don't go all the way. All the way through. - [Paula] And then do you need. a spoon to scoop them out? - [Claudia] No, well this one's hard, but the fun part now is. that you will do, like this. Ta-dah! - [Paula] It's like that pop it. - Yes, and then you can eat it. Like this, like if we were. gonna eat it straight. You can just eat it like this. This one. - That's great. - [Claudia] It can come. out with your hands. - [Paula] But now, Oli. doesn't eat it that way. - [Claudia] Well, she licks the,- - [Paula] Does she? - [Claudia] This usually comes out easier. But I wash my hands. - [Paula] 'Cause I always. see them in chunks. - [Claudia] Yeah, I washed. my hands before I came, so people are not saying. I didn't wash my hands. (Claudia laughing) Always wash your hands. and then you just bob. Again, it should be, you know. This one is, I mean, I'm sure it's delicious, but- - [Paula] It is, it's delicious. I just tasted it.. - [Claudia] It could have sat a couple of days. Or you could also, if you want,. you could also wrap it up. - [Paula] Please don't cut yourself. - [Claudia] Yeah, you could also that. But I feel like when you. do it with your hands, it comes out more closer to the skin. - [Paula] Well that is delicious. - [Claudia] Yes, and then- - [Paula] If I was here. by myself or maybe, didn't have to be by myself.. - And then you eat this. - I would eat this. - Then you eat that. Yeah,. that's what I usually do. - Mm, you do? - Yeah, and I give that to. Oli and she'll eat that. And then with this little guy,. I'll just do like a strip, if you wanna get this one. Okay, and then what you do with this, you just work around the you know, so all I do is just I just try to. Let me move this at least, so. I just try to get all these little- - [Paula] As much of the meat you can. - [Claudia] Meat as you can, yeah. (knife cutting) - [Paula] See that just. seems like such a waste. It's such a big seed. - [Claudia] Yeah, and I just, well, I mean you can suck this. - [Paula] Oh, thank you. So no part goes to waste. and then this you just cut. - [Paula] I think there's. some more you can cut there. - Yeah probably, smaller.. - Can you get that closer? - [Claudia] Or you can eat it. - [Paula] 'Cause I'm thinking about Oli. - Yeah no, that's really close to the pit. (Paula giggling). (Claudia giggling) And that's it. That's how you kind of mango. Ta-dah! - Yes, there was nothing left to cut. - No, not really. - Mm-mm, mm. - That's it. - Now how are these as far. as fat or calories concerned? - Oh no, we don't care about that. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] We don't? - We're in Paula Deen's kitchen, we don't care about calories or fat. No, it's not fat. It's just fruit. It's a natural fruit, natural sugar. All good for you, vitamin C. (tongue clicks) Love vitamin C. - Oh, take that one home with you. - [Claudia] Oh, is that enough? - Yes.. - Okay, great. I'll take it with me and I'll. give it a couple of days. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Claudia] Perfect, awesome. - [Paula] 'Cause I don't. want you to cut it, if it's- - [Claudia] Yeah. - So what we're gonna do now, is put all the fruits and this bowl. If you wanna do that. - Okay, I'll help you. - And then we made a. sauce to goes with it. - Blueberries, strawberries,. green melon, kiwi. - [Paula] You're stirring. that up a little bit. - [Claudia] We're putting. it in the bigger bowl. - [Paula] Mm-hmm. - [Claudia] Ta-dah! It's Beautiful. - [Paula] Yes. Now, I would not sauce the whole thing. - [Claudia] Yeah, maybe too much. - [Paula] Yes, I would give. everybody a little cup. - [Claudia] Probably by portions, because if you have leftovers, you don't want it to get mushier. - [Paula] No, yeah. 'Cause you want it to have a longer life than what it would be. All right, so let's get us. Let me see if I can- - [Claudia] We need to mix this, wait. - [Paula] Okay. (water running) - [Claudia] So you get all the fruit. That's beautiful. - [Paula] Isn't that pretty? - [Claudia] It's a rainbow salad. - [Paula] And with the fruit, there's your toothpick, and with the fruit being. so plentiful right now. - [Claudia] Oh yeah. I'm gonna get a kiwi. - [Paula] I'm gonna get a strawberry. (Paula giggling) - Mm, that's delicious, mm-hmm. - That's kick butt, isn't it? - Mm-hmm, you know what you can do too. You can do this as skewers? Is that what's it called? And then you can serve them I guess for a pool party or something. and you can dip them. This is delicious. - [Paula] I've got some skewers. if you want to take some. - [Claudia] I have some too. - [Paula] Okay and make the kids. Mm. - I don't know if I'd trust. them with the skewers. (Claudia laughing) Not sure. - That sauce is delicious, isn't it? - Mm-hmm. - Look. - Just drink it, cheers. - Cheers. (Claudia laughing) - [Paula] Bon appetit. (Claudia laughing) (Paula laughing) - Is that yummy? - It's like condensed milk? - Yeah, it kind of tastes, mm, there's no condensed milk in it. - That's good, mm.. - Mm. - Mm. - Thank you. - Thank you Ginny. - I knew that I knew- - Somebody that could cut. a mango. (Claudia laughing) - A real expert, 'cause honey, I wouldn't. near about done it that way. (both laughing) I would've been here. chomping and chomping. - Cut your fingers. - So I want you to take. this to the babies. - I will, mm-hmm. And I've got a lot more. fruit to give you too. - So thanks, Claud rushed. home to help do this with me. - So I appreciate it. - You're welcome. - And I love you. - Love you too. (lips smacking) - I love you. So that's it. - What I'm gonna do? - What are you gonna do? - No I said, I'm gonna take some of it. - You're not gonna take all of it? - It's a lot. (Claudia giggling) - Please take all of it.. - Okay, I will. - The way your kids go through fruit. (Paula laughing) - Bye-bye y'all.. - Bye. - Love and best dishes.
