hey y'all I'm Paula Deen and you know in my humble opinion you can never have too much of a good thing and in this case that means dessert today I'm gonna be fixing few confections that are just a perfect ending to any meal first up is a decadent Charlotte Russe and then it's owned my we go eat off a butter cake and finally my sweet Southwest Georgia pound cake where nobody does it better so stick around y'all cuz today is like a dessert dream come true you Charlotte Russe it's an old old desert that's been around for years and years and years it's very much like a trifle now I'm gonna put 1/4 of a cup of milk in my saucepan and while that's just warming up I've got some water here and I've got a plain gelatin here and we're going to just sprinkle that gelatin into that water and I'm gonna let that bloom we're gonna take this off and I'm gonna add my gelatin to the milk and give that a stir and it's already thickening up that milk alright I've got that dissolved and I'm just gonna sit that over here and then we're going to move on over here to our egg whites and these eggs are at room temperature you always want to start with room-temperature eggs they just work better alright so we're just gonna dump our whites into here and then you'll want to save your yolks for another dish okay and this is our last egg all right and I'm gonna put these aside and save these for another recipe alright now we're going to beat these until they form stiff but not dry Pete alright that looks like nice still geeks alright I'm gonna move this to the side and bring in this other bowl and in this bowl I'm gonna beat two cups of heavy whipping cream and I'm gonna add a cup of granulated white sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm gonna beat this until it forms stiff peaks also and then I'm gonna fold these two things together along with our milk and our gelatin and our water [Music] all right let me move this out of the way what we're gonna do now is we're going to fold in our sweetens whipped cream into our egg whites and while that's gelatin dissolving I'm gonna go ahead and start folding these two things together and when you fold you want to go under and over so to make sure that we milk it's not too hot I'm gonna pour it back into this cold bowl and that will cheer it back down and that's fine it's just it almost feels like the temperature of my body so I'm just gonna drizzle that through here and then fold it in with the other ingredients it's gonna make a wonderful gooey sweet Center fine Charlotte Russe all right now we're going to make a mold out of this Charlotte Russe well I'm gonna use just a glass pyrex dish and I'm gonna start with ladyfingers and I'm putting about three across the bottom and then I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna stand up these ladyfingers around the bowl and you want to make sure that you fill in all the gaps because we're gonna unmold this onto a dish all right now I've gotten some sweet sherry and I'm just gonna take our sherry and we're gonna come in here and I'm gonna brush our ladyfingers with the sherry all right and now I've gotten some wonderful strawberry preserves these are store-bought now I'm gonna put a layer of the strawberry preserves down there and you can see how that's coming along now I'm gonna move over here and get our cream filling and I'm just gonna fill up the middle of these ladyfingers mmm and then I'm gonna top it with some more ladyfingers and if I have to I'll break some pieces to just finish that all right I've got it all covered with ladyfingers now and I've got a little bit more sherry left so I'm going to take that last little bit and just dab on top and now I'm going to take a plastic wrap and I'm gonna seal this up real good and I'm gonna stick it in the refrigerator for four to six hours because I want this chilled very very good and when we come back y'all I'm combining two of my most favorite things in the whole world a gooey butter cake and toffee chips so don't go away gooey butter cake [Music] we're back and before we get on to that gooey butter cake that I was talking about before break I want to go ahead and unwrap our roots because I had one that's been in the refrigerator now for about four hours and I'm gonna go ahead and unmold this and I'm gonna slowly tilt it and let the air get up in there now I had some filling leftover and I'm gonna dress this with just a little of our filling and I've got some raspberries and strawberries I'm just gonna drop some fruit around it I'm gonna come in here and fan me out a berry and put in the center of that mmm that looks just delicious and I'm gonna sip that over there now y'all have seen me make gooey butter cakes several times on the show I think kind of all the gooey butter cakes just the basic recipe may very well be my favorite and then I'm adding chocolate toffee bits and you can find these in your baking section these are just yummy so I'm gonna start with the base try gooey butter cake I've got a stick of butter melted here I've got a yellow cake mix here I'm gonna add one egg and one stick of melted butter now while I'm mixing up this I'm gonna go ahead and add another stick of butter so that's gonna melt and we're gonna mix this up and this batter is gonna be real real thick all right I've got our crust in one egg and one stick of melted butter blended together here but because I'm cooking outside and using my little mini oven a 13 by 9 by 2 wouldn't fit in this oven so I'm doing it in 2 8 by 8 pans all I'm gonna do is divide our batter up half in one pan and half in the other and we're just going to press this into our pan now we're going to come over here and we're going to make the filling to our gooey butter cake and I'm going to use the same bowl I don't have to wash it it's not going to affect the center of our our gooey I'm going to start with an 8 ounce package of cream cheese that's been softened to room temperature I'm going to add two eggs a teaspoon of vanilla another stick of melted butter get every drop out and one 16 ounce box of powdered sugar now we're just gonna beat this up until it's smooth alright and now we're going to add our toffee bits to this I'm just gonna fold those in now you can get toffee bits two ways you can get the plain toffee bits or you can get toffee bits with chocolate now I'm gonna divide this Center into both of these pans and I'm just spreading this out alright I like a little sprinkled on top so when it bakes you can see that it's not just a regular gooey butter cake so I'm gonna take a few and just put on top like that now I'm gonna put these in the oven it's been preheated to 350 degrees and because of the sizes of these pans I'm gonna just watch that I'm gonna keep checking on them periodically after like 30 minutes so I think I've waited long enough I'm gonna come in here and cut me a piece oh that looks good you can see those strawberry preserves I just love the way this looks it's got the different textures and they're the creamed Center and the strength that the ladyfingers give it the next thing up is the southwest Georgia pound cake I'll see y'all back in a minute [Music] our duty butter cakes turned out really really good it's amazing how well these little ovens or bake these gooey butter cakes look delicious too sometimes I'll use these to put in the center of Baked Alaska so I'm gonna try to resist tasting it and just keep those piled up there they look scrumptious alright let's talk about pound cakes this is one of the favorite pound cakes of the folks that live in southwest Georgia where I was born I was born in Albany Georgia and a lot of people over there make these cakes and I'm gonna start with two sticks of real butter at room temperature now I'm gonna add three cups of sugar and I'm gonna beat these together until they're nice and creamy all right now I'm gonna add the eggs all right that's nice and creamy now all right now I've got three cups of all-purpose flour and I have a half a teaspoon of baking powder and I'm going to give those this quick stiff together and that was baking powder now not soda all right now we're going to add our dry ingredients to our creamed mixture we're going to start with flour and end with flour if we started with heavy cream and ended with green it would almost make our batter look like it had broken I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla [Music] all right now I'm gonna take a bundt cake pan and I'm gonna spray it cuz you want to make sure that your pound cakes always come out and don't leave chunks in the pan and I'm gonna just this with a little flour we're just gonna pour our batter around and we're gonna start this cake off now in a cold oven and we're gonna bake it for an hour in 15 minutes and you'll want to just take your spatula and level out your cake like that now like I said we're not gonna turn our oven own until we put our cake in the oven when we put the cake in the oven we're going to turn it to 325 by an hour and 15 minutes and it's going to be so light and rich and dense at the same time I think the cook is earned the right to taste a gooey butter cake so let's see how they turned out they look yummy you can see the toffee nut and the chocolate in the gooey part of that mmm it's unbelievably rich while our cakes baking I'm gonna clean up and when we come back I'm gonna show y'all ways that you can take that ordinary pound cake and really dress them up so I'll see y'all back in a minute [Music] I was telling y'all earlier that southerners love their pound cake but we also love doing different things with it like our toast buttering it and frying it up in the black skillet whether it's just long the things that you can do with a pound cake besides just eating it straight up personally I love my Strawberry Shortcake made with fresh pound cake you know you can get the little the little cups in the grocery store that have the indented Center and that's what my momma used to use a lot of times and they were perfectly yummy but nothing absolutely nothing takes the place of real Shortcake so I'm gonna take our cake and I'm gonna just pour fresh strawberries and that juice over it we really get get that juice all over it to soak into that piece of cake and then I'm gonna top it with fresh whipped cream and you've got the best strawberry shortcake you've ever put in your mouth and another flavoring that I really really love is the flavor of lemon curd I just love it now you can make your own lemon curd or you can do as I've done today and just use a store-bought I'm just gonna let that lemon curd just drip all over that piece of pound cake and then I'm gonna top him with just a little fresh zest these are just a couple of my favorite ways and I'm sure once you make that pound cake that you're going to come up with plenty of other ways yourself well did y'all enjoy today's show I hope that you did because you know there's just nothing better than just a whole bunch of desserts the southwest Georgia whipping cream pound cake is so unbelievably dense and rich and delicious and the gooey butter cakes I swear to Peter I didn't think I could improve them but I think that the toffee bits just really take it over the top and the Charlotte Russe oh it's just delicious it's an old timey dessert that we can still enjoy today I hope y'all love all the recipes and as usual America I want to send you loving best dishes from my kitchen to yours you
