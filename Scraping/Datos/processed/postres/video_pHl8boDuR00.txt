home of SCAD Savannah College of Art and Design so we have some great art supply stores well right now I'm in primary art supply and they have some neat things look this looks like a little pot server

right here except for the gift and I'm gonna take care of that one they so be great to wrap our candies in oh my goodness [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just adore making candies I just love it so I'm gonna share the almond coconut balls with you first now I've got two boxes of confectioner's sugar and I'm gonna add one stick of a really softened butter I'm gonna add one can of sweetened condensed milk now I'm gonna put a teaspoon of almond flavoring a bag of sweetened flaked coconut and I'm gonna finish this off with a cup and a half of chopped almonds your hands kids kind of look like the abominable snowman when you pull them out all right and see how quickly we've gotten that together it doesn't take long at all okay got to do a quick wash-up I've got me a cookie sheet ready here and y'all will notice that these are no cooked candies now this is the boring part making balls so you might want to whistle in for the family cause before you know it you get to talking and chatting and laughing and having a good time and all the balls are done I'm bored already I cuz I got some ready in the refrigerator so they ain't no sense in me doing this is it alright here's our chilled Bowl now I'm gonna take chocolate chips now you can use semi sweet or unsweet alright I'm gonna use a half a bar of paraffin wax and that's why it's that you used to like make your jellies and jams with and this is gonna make the chocolate stick to our candy so I'm just gonna melt that over some ball and water it's gonna make our balls real real shiny and pretty way to go Paula alright now we're gonna take our candy we're gonna stick a skewer into it you can use it toothpick but I found that the skewers are heavier and it just works better so we're just gonna run them around in there using another stick I'm gonna push that off and just cover that hole pretty neat little trick getting it so we're gonna do that same thing again perfect alright I tell y'all something this has made me so hungry I've got some in the refrigerator that's already set cause you can leave these out on the counter or you can put them in the refrigerator well I want to rush it along so I put mine in the refrigerator so why don't we stop and have a little bite of candy and then I'll come back and do these while we're on break good least look and they've hardened up now these candies are good at any holiday look at those chocolates you don't stick around cuz when we come back I'm gonna be making old-timey fudge like I used to make years ago and pecan praline more alright I'm gathering up the last of the things that I'm gonna need to make two of my candies that I love so very much but let's get started with our old-timey fudge right now and I'm gonna put three cups of sugar and a cup of evaporated milk I'm gonna put that on this side and then over here I'm gonna put our cocoa and we're just gonna incorporate that real good until our sugar has dissolved and our cocoa is well blended in there all right now I'm gonna stir in about three tablespoons of a white corn syrup and this is gonna make our candy just come all together like I said you just want to make sure you have a good thermometer that you can read some of them today they're hard to read all right so I'm gonna go ahead and clip this onto our pot yeah we're just 150 degrees right now so we're gonna just let that cook over kind of kind of medium heat so we'll want to keep a close eye on our thermometer all right now over here we're gonna move on try a pecan praline morsels I've got my two cups of pecans here and I've got a half a cup of light brown sugar and a half a cup of heavy cream the brown sugar and the heavy cream are gonna give it kind of a praline coating on these pecans and they're just gonna be so good now we're gonna put these on our pan we're gonna put them in a 350 preheated oven and we're gonna let them bake for about 20 minutes after about 10 minutes I'm gonna go the oven and stir them because you have to be very very careful with nuts because if they burn which they won't burn easily there's just nothing you can do to get that burnt taste out of them all right so we're gonna give our pan a squirt all right we're gonna dump these onto our cookie sheet all right so let's get these in the oven because I've got to give my attention back to that fudge all right ten minutes we'll give those a quick little turn to just make sure they're not burning it's right there y'all around to 34 to 35 with this thermometer is reading properly all right I'm gonna take that out and I'm gonna add six tablespoons of butter may have been seven tablespoons I added I can't tell all right we're gonna add about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla flavoring and cup of chopped nuts we're about a cup and a half I like to add the pecan to it but you can do walnuts macadamia nuts alright we've got our dish nice and buttered now we're just gonna stir this I think to save some wear and tear on my arm I think I'm gonna do this with electric mixer just a little hand mixer we're gonna beat it until it's not quite so shiny [Applause] we want to work quickly from this point and it looks very good y'all just get this into our butter dish before it gets too hard let it cool for a few minutes and then I'm gonna score it and cut it but I think we have created a wonderful pan of old-timey fudge I gotta run over here and check on these pecans because I know it's been ten minutes and we need to turn them and toss them around we've got yeah those look pretty good just gonna give them a quick toss all right now we're gonna stick those in for about ten more minutes now when we come back I'm gonna be making buttery nut fingers so y'all don't go anywhere cuz we got some more good sweet things coming up see you in a couple [Music] I don't want to get my spoon out because I know I'm gonna need it in a minute but in the meantime we've got to check on our pecans all right those look delicious don't they all right let's get them up and get them in our bowl cuz we don't want to keep these on that hot cookie sheet because they will continue to cook yeah I don't I don't know what happened all my little spatula respect this one's working out good in fact I'm really starting to get attached to it all right now I'm gonna move this because we're fixing to move on to an old standard of cookie now this particular recipe that I used was my grandmother Paul's and grandma made hers in balls well and sometimes I do them that way too but over the years I just started making them in fingers but in the meantime I've got two and a half cups of plain flour or all-purpose flour 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and we're just gonna mix those two ingredients together this cookie is very very easy but it does take a while because they have to bake for about 20 or 25 minutes which is what about 15 minutes longer than a normal cookie whoops Pillsbury Dough girl all right now I'm gonna start this off by using a wooden spoon to just kind of cut that butter in there a little all right now I'm gonna put in some vanilla flavoring and if you wanted to kind of shake your flavoring up you could do just about any kind of flavoring you want to orange flavor and would be nice almond would be delicious in there all right now I'm gonna add our chopped pecans and you can see how quickly let me get my hands in here it's coming together I still think that some of my best utensils are the ones that God gave me these two hands right here they make great spoons and mixers so like I said my grandmother Paul used to roll these into balls but I'm gonna roll mine into fingers and I just remembered our oven is on 350 from our pecans so I'm gonna reach over here and turn that to 325 and if my hands are not too greasy I'm just gonna fan it to cool it down for a minute because we're ready to put these in the oven all right so here we go into the oven [Applause] okay so we got those in the oven but I've gotten dough all over my hands so I'm gonna give a quick grant I love raw cookie dough but I don't want to mix it in with my fudge so I do want to get rid of that all right nothing this is probably my favorite time right now I get to cut into my fudge and let's see how it does oh and look ya'll look down here at my side she's enjoying this unusually cool but wonderful day we're having it's made all the dogs sleepy including this dog I could take a nap tube look at this wonderful fudge oh my goodness this brings back so many memories oh it could not be any more perfect it is just hard to beat the old-timey cooked fudge mmm just can't hardly wait not that this fudge needs that not at all but I just want to garnish the plate a little bit so I'm just gonna dust it with a little cocoa and just to make sure I do have enough nuts on it I'm just gonna sprinkle it with a few extra cuz I can always take my piece of fudge and dunk in there like that and get me a few more nuts mmm this is so good it's kind of got me booyah I'm lost in it but if I don't work my way out of this we gonna have bud burn if I can say it we're gonna have burned buttery fingers so let's go over here and check you can see how they swelled up a little those are perfect just barely a light brown let's see if I can alright now we're just gonna toss these in our powdered sugar while they are warm and look it's sticking so nicely I've got me a plate and when we come back I'm gonna show you some tips on how to wrap all these wonderful little goodies up [Music] I want to share a few tips with y'all on packaging your candy now that we've got it all made you can take tissue papers and it's very very pretty to take two different kinds of tissue paper and offset one of them pile your candy in the center as much as you want to give and then pull up the corners like so and tie them up with a pretty ribbon and you've got a perfect container and you can also buy a little colored sacks you can get your corresponding colors and write a message on them just like this and our pecans will go nicely in these sides because it kind of looks like a little peanut sac anyway and we'll just tie those up with a pretty ribbon you can use Halloween colors and look how cute that is a great little handout for the children at Halloween so if you don't have time to make your candy don't spread over it don't feel guilty don't feel bad you can go to the grocery store or the candy store and find all kind of beautiful candy and all different colors and you can package them in a clear bag and put the ribbon that matches the occasion on them it's gonna make your candy giving so easy boys and girls moms and dads grandmas and grandpas aunts and uncles whatever you're making of these dishes the butternut fingers the chocolate almond coconut balls the pecan praline morsels or old-timey old-fashioned fudge whether you want to pass these out at Holiday time or you just want to have them around your house for your family and friends when they drop in you're gonna find that they're all easy delicious recipes so until next time America I want to send Joe that's dishes from my sweet tooth to yours
