- Hey, y'all, it's Jamie Deen. I'm back in mama's kitchen and today I'm gonna share a delicious dessert recipe with y'all. It's a chocolate butterscotch. peanut butter cobbler. It's in one of mom's magazines. You never know what you. find laying around here. Look at my number one son right there with his Georgia shirt on and his mama. Whoo, that's a good looking woman. And there's mama too. She's good looking too. All right, y'all, so what. we're gonna do today, super easy, lot of. ingredients, several steps, but we'll go nice and slow. So I've taken my butter, first thing I'm gonna do is melt three quarters. of a stick of butter. Put it into our pan. Now the one rule that we're gonna repeat. a couple of times here, once everything is in here,. this is one of those things where we do not stir it together. This is a pour and a bake. So step one, our base of our cobbler here. I've got our flour. We've got some sugar. I've got cocoa powder. And we're gonna whisk in this milk. Let me see how much vanilla. I know that they always tell. y'all what it's supposed to be, and I'm terrible about measurements. One and a half teaspoons. So we'll go, boop, boop,. boop, boop, close enough. Be careful with your vanilla. Y'all measure that! I'm a trained professional. (Theresa laughs) (chuckling) I heard that, Theresa. I'm gonna whisk in our milk. I love cobblers, y'all,. and it is cobbler season. It's summer is heating up down here. Our peaches are back. You give me a peach cobbler with some ice cream on a summer night and you won't hear any. complaints outta me. I love blackberry cobblers. You don't see a lot of chocolate cobblers, so this is gonna be interesting to see. So I've got all of this whipped together. Now, while that's sitting there, I'm gonna do our dry ingredients. here in our second bowl. Y'all know what, I bet we should probably. take a little break right now because they tell me I. don't ever take breaks. So let's take a break, and when we come back, I'll be standing right. here and we'll do this. All right. And here I am. Okay. Next, cocoa powder. Peanuts. Granulated sugar. Brown sugar. And butterscotch morsels. I'm just gonna real simply. dry mix this together, making sure all this gets. incorporated really good. Mmm-mmm-mmm. I'm doing several recipes. here at mom's today and we're starting with dessert, which is always a good sign. So our brown sugar. Make sure you get all this matched up. This is a chocolate lover's dream here. Look at all this cocoa. All right, now here we go. with the "do not stir." Here is our wet bowl, our batter. It's gonna go right on. top of our melted butter. Y'all know not to stir cobblers, right? You never twist a cobbler. because you want that batter to cook its way up around the edges. Now on top of this, we're. gonna add our dry ingredients. Do not stir. Do not stir this. I know you want to. I want to. Wait till you see what I do next. So all of our dry ingredients are on here. I cannot stand it. I've just got to flatten. it out a little bit. I probably shouldn't. Now, this is the weird part. We are going to... It takes a scientist to. figure out mom's oven. We're gonna pour one and a. half cups of boiling water right on top of this. Look at that. Here comes Mama on the. speakerphone, as normal. Mama, I'm filming! - [Mama] Oh, I'm sorry. - [Jamie] It's all right. - [Mama] I gotta take my dog out... - [Jamie] Daggommit, Mama, I can't do but one thing at a time. - [Mama] (laughing) Sorry! - [Jamie] Okay. Okay. And. she's talking on the phone. This is our last half a cup. So we've got our batter went in right on top of our butter, and then our dry ingredients. went on top of the batter. And then we've added one and. a half cups of boiling water and never, not one. time, stirred any of it. So I'm gonna pop this into. the oven at probably 350. I'll tell you when it's done what I cooked it on and how long it took. Going in the oven, y'all! Ooh, stick around. Chocolate cobbler. Hey, y'all, looky-looky. This is our butterscotch. chocolate cobbler that we've made. And it just so happens,. one of my favorite people, my main man Henry, has found. a seat at the right time. He walked in and said, "Mmm!" And I said, "Guess what, Hen?" "You're in position 1-A today." So this is butterscotch chocolate cobbler. It has just come out of the oven and look how delicious. and gooey this looks. And I know you didn't. come for the green stuff. but I'm gonna garnish. it a little bit for you. - [Henry] Okay. - [Jamie] So y'all, it's. coming up on 4th of July and you're gonna have people over. You need a spoon. Theresa dear, please. - [Theresa] That's what I'm grabbing. - [Henry] Thank you.. - Thank you. - [Theresa] You're welcome. Oh look, let's see Theresa today. Look how beautiful she looks. Look, you look so nice today. - [Theresa] Thank you. - [Jamie] Here's your spoon, Henry. So listen, it's the 4th of July. You're gonna have friends. You're gonna have family around. Everybody wants some dessert. Why not take a chance to make something that'll surprise people, a. chocolate butterscotch cobbler, for this 4th of July. Put you a little bit of. ice cream on top of this. - [Henry] Mmm. - [Jamie] Great day in the morning. Henry, tell the people. - [Henry] That good.. - [Jamie] That good. Save a little bit of your morsels and a little bit of peanuts on top. Really super simple. Delicious. Your friends will be. lining up on July the 5th to see if there's any leftovers.
