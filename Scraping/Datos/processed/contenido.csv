0bDq4mJrt4c.json;- I'm in here with one of our grandsons. This is Sullivan Brooks. - Hey. And he is here visiting last week before you start school, right? - Yes Ma'am. And then you're going. back to Birmingham when? In the morning? - Yes Ma'am 6:00 AM. - Oh, I'm gonna miss you so bad. So Sullivan has been. wanting to get in here and help me make some things. So I have got a recipe in. cooking with Paula Deen magazine. Do you ever a cook out of my magazine? - Sullivan? - No, ma'am - Okay Good. - But my mom does. - But your mom does. That's important. So we are gonna make this. blackberry coffee cake with the strudel topping. Cause y'all will love that. for breakfast in the morning. Before you take off at six o'clock this is something you. can carry along with you. All right. So the first thing we're gonna. do is the strudel topping. Sullivan, So if you'll take this bowl and you see all these things right here? That's cinnamon, brown sugar, flour, and more sugar. So if you'll just mix. those four things together and use that fork to fluff 'em up. And while you're doing that, I've got. This recipe is like in kind. of three sections y'all. And you just fluff that. with your fork and it'll, it'll be so good on top of these black, this Blackberry coffee cake. So I've got my flour, I've got salt. I have got baking powder here. And what I have here is. that a little, what is that? What is it? Do you recognize that smell? I think it's one of the. things that you like. Ginger. Don't you, you don't like ginger. Well, I'm sorry I thought you did. - I only like ginger ale. - Ginger ale, okay. So are you excited to get back to school? - Kind of but kind of not. - And you gonna be in the fourth grade? - Yes ma'am. - I can't believe it. It was like yesterday you were born. It's hard to believe Sullivan. And you going back and. you playing football. Yes Ma'am. - All right. Now I have. mixed up my flower base. - Is this good? - That is very good. Thank you so much Sullivan. All right. let's see. Now we're gonna need our electric mixer, because we are gonna cream our butter and our sugar together. And do you wanna man, the, the mixer? - Do I just press this? - Let's put it in here. and look, see up there? It says uh-oh, somebody's. turned off our power. And it's strong Sullivan. It's real strong. So just cream that up real good. Going good. It's going real good. I'm gonna go ahead and. add our vanilla flavoring and that'll help, I'll help you mix it a little bit better. Let's see if we can turn. it up just a little bit. (laughing) That's getting it ain't it. Well you had a good time these four days since you been home? - Yes Ma'am. - What been your favorite thing to do. - Seeing my friend Wesley. - And your cousin? - Yes Ma'am. - You got You got - Oh and going to eat at. that Georgia fried catfish at your restaurant. - Yeah. We ate The lady. and Sons yesterday. And wasn't it so good. Sullivan wanted catfish. And the rest of the guys. wanted chicken, fried chicken. So we got a little of both. All right. Now here's what we're gonna do Sully. We're gonna cut this off. And we're gonna, we're gonna get our spatula and go around here and. push everything down. So it'll get mixed up real good. So now we are gonna. take our flower mixture that we have made and we've got our milk. And we are gonna begin with. flour and end with flour. Okay? So if you take your mixer and be mixing that and. I'll add our flour, okay? - I'll turn it up to two. - Wait, let's turn it, start at one right now. There you go. I can't see all that well. I see things that are not there. (laughing) There you go. Go all around the edges. And now I'm going to add. a little of your milk. Perfect. All right, now I'm gonna. add some more flour. This is gonna be delicious and Sullivan, You know, miss Emily, the lady. that does my hair and makeup? She, her family grows. blackberries where they live and she brought me a great big bucket. Their fresh black berries. So that's what we're gonna use. I'll put 'em in the freezer. so we could have 'em later. So that's what we're gonna have. So we've got all the ingredients in there. I'm going to reach in. here and get the spray. So it won't stick. Just so it won't stick. Just a little bit. All right. So the first thing we're. gonna do, Sullivan, is we're gonna take our cake part and put it into an eight by eight pan. And we gonna make sure. this is spread out evenly. - So we can put our blackberries in? - Yes. And you wanna do that part? - Yes. Ma'am. - I'll do this part if you'll. do the Blackberry part. - Okay. - Okay just spread that out. This is gonna be delicious. I love coffee cake with coffee. - Especially. It's so good. - Am I allowed to have it? - What? - This - Oh, yes. No, no this doesn't have coffee in it. That's just what it's called. - Oh. - Coffee cakes. It's, it's cakes that people. like to have with their coffee. - Oh yeah. - Okay. So there you go. Our blueberries, our. blackberries are frozen. - Do I just dump it or. - Well, you could do it to make it even you could just do it, kind of like that. How about that? - Okay. - And look at your friends. You got your friend here, Wesley and you got your cousin, - Sup - [Paula] John here. What's up. (laughing) - [Sullivan] We use the whole thing? - [Paula] Yes. We're going. to use every bit of it. These are big blackberries. Like I said, miss Emily. Huh? Beautiful fresh blackberries. - [Sullivan] Yummy. - [Paula] Mm. So yummy. - You know, you have to be careful if you're out picking blackberries, cause you know snakes hang around blackberry bushes. Because the blackberries attract the birds and the snake is sitting there waiting for a bird to come along. So if you're ever picking blackberries you have to keep a close. eye out cause snakes. - Can I dumb that in? - Yes. You can do that. And we've got our oven set. to 350 degrees Sullivan and we are gonna bake it for, I don't know maybe 45 minutes or until it comes out, you know clean. The toothpick that we stick in it. - [Eddie] The blackberries. froze up pretty good. They didn't, they didn't. get diss-formed or anything. - [Paula] Oh no. They're just beautiful. - [Sullivan] I use all of this? - [Paula] Yes. Get around here too. Make sure you got some strudel everywhere. I hope that y'all have had. an opportunity this summer. You mama's and grand-mama's out there. I hope y'all have had a chance to get in the kitchen with your. grandchildren and cook with them, because it really is a. wonderful way to make memories with your grandchildren. - That's what I do. I do with you and Mimi. - Oh good. - Every single time I. go to a lake with her. - What do y'all fix? - Either barbecue sandwiches or brownies. - [Paula] All right so, I think this'll be a lot better. - [Sullivan] Yeah. Buttery. - [Paula] dotted with the butter. Don't you? - [Sullivan] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Yes sir. Buddy. Miss Theresa was holding out on us. - [Theresa] Didn't mean to. Didn't mean to she said. Okay. There we go. You wanna put all these. dishes in the sink, Sullivan. - Yes. Ma'am. - while I get this in the oven. - Here I can get that. - Okay. Well there, we needed Miss Theresa. So guys, I'll see y'all back here in the. kitchen in about 45 minutes. Okay? And we're gonna taste. your great sous chef- Helpers ran off on me y'all and I told him, I said, I'll, I'll wait. Cause Sully said, can John. and Wesley be in it too? I said, yes. Y'all can all finish up with. me, taste it and finish it up. Well they left. So we may have to add a little bit more to this when they get back Eddie. I don't know how long. they're gonna be gone. - [Female Voice] I see Eddie. and I having a piece too. So we will have to really. figure out that one. - Oh Emily, thank you so. much for those blackberries. They're so good. I can't see a Blackberry without thinking about my grandma Paul and. all the blackberry cobbler she cooked in her lifetime. - [Female Voice] That was sweet. That was easy. - Mm. So easy. So good. Real good. Are my teeth purple. Now I gotta try to even this out where I dug into it. I think y'all will like it.;['postres']
0E4qfUX_2uk.json;yo my teammates are killing me everybody's patience might be getting short until recent Eddie there they look like those ready have a catfight Barney well it was funny yellow playing but it was still funny y'all made me laugh so in 1989 when I started the bag lady everyday I made a special dessert that appeared to be everybody's favorite and that was gooey butter cakes well I made those gooey butter cake every day we started on June the 19th I made vanilla gooey butter cakes every day and when October the 1st came around I said y'all hear those funny noises it's not anybody breaking wind it's it's Teresa over here using a turkey baster make in those sounds I'm beat I'm pregnant I'll cut them for the next one well it sounds like you'll be doing something else so anyway when October came around y'all I said if I don't change these gooey butter cakes up I'm gonna scream so it was October it was time to start cooking with pumpkins so I formulated it to make the pumpkins butter cake and I promise you that has been one of the country's babies break sweet day - yeah sweet potato oh my gosh it's so good so I'm gonna show y'all how I made that very first gooey butter cake on June the 19th 1989 and we're gonna start with just a yellow cake mix or white you've got white that's fine alright I'm going to add 1 egg and 1 stick of milky splutter and this is gonna be the base now I just take my mixer and it's gonna be real but I just take my mixer and I mix it the best I can to it kind of all gets moistened just like this oh yeah it's doing good so over the years I swear I bet between me and my team over the years have probably formulated I bet 50 or 75 different ways to make gooey butter cake I am not kidding you because we get tired of making the same old warning all right now it's just swinging that dough out of there Oh cuz we get tired and we want to do something new so we had fun and I'm hoping that you have fun with it too this is just the very face stick but you know what after all these years it might still be my favorite one I'm gonna spray that just a little bit just ensure but this is not so much buttering I probably won't have to worry about it sticking but just out of habit all right something take my hands and just spread this out is evenly as I can and up the sides a little bit oh my gosh does this bring back Oh out of memories that bag lady it was a phenomenal little business it gave my sons and myself wings which was just wonderful only in America all right so I got my base spread out right right nice and easy easy even just like that all right so now as we'll make the custard Park and I'm gonna start with an 8 ounce package of cream cheese and let's see that's my melted butter so I think I'm just gonna whip this purse you get kind of fluffy come on swingin bring cheese all over the place all right I'm gonna lower that so it'll just barely missed it all right I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla I'm gonna add two eggs once in a while extent to which gooey butter cake I'm making but once in a while like the pumpkin gooey butter take I'll add three eggs at this point but only two is is really necessary all right now I'm gonna add two cups of powdered sugar and that's where we gonna get our stone all right number one slowly add that butter cuz I know I know you probably weighed all of 128 fine yeah big use a mouse I wouldn't mean to come out in public class her know everybody loves it and this has become our signature and people know when they come into Paula Deen family kitchen or or the lady in sons or Creek house they know that they're gonna be all first do we better catch all right so I'm just don't beat that a little bit more to get the long side of it [Applause] [Applause] and you notice I didn't mean wash my bowl or the beaters because it's all going in the same pot so you know you have to stop and watch alright I am going to do [Music] oh I just love nuts and smashed up you can see demand but you don't have to have them it's all about what you like what's your tongue like okay Michael I'm putting nuts silly buoys I guess that's why we get along we both like nuts all right so I'm gonna pour this on I don't know y'all heard him but he said that was one reason for his strong attraction to me was he liked newest go back to cooking your meat he's cooking up a Boston but on his grill out there all right Michael's favorite gooey butter cake I don't know if I've ever talked about this but his favorite is banana doing butter cake I make it just like this I'm a mash up you know how big the bananas are a couple of bananas just squish it up you know put it in the feeling here is the most important part now about this recipe it's super simple you can't mess it up until you go to cook it and I know the name of this is gooey butter cake but it's really not a cake when you're baking a cake you want it to be done when you stick up a toothpick in the center you want it to come out clean well this is not Oh tell my grandchildren and Michelle are doing they boys come over you can get them in can you get the door shut boy I love y'all so much look at immunity I could kiss y'all heads off so we still honoring the quarantine around here y'all they're gonna stay six feet away from each other trying that may be hard for a but Michelle this wanting to make sure that her daddy and I stay safe and we're not exposed to anything so all right so back to the cooking of this you really don't have to watch it because you know your oven unless you've calibrated your oven by putting up the monitor in there and set it to 350 and then checking your thermometer to see where where it measures up to but anyway we're gonna cook this for 40 to 50 minutes but when you at the end of 40 minutes you want to do your pan like this and you want it to jiggle just a little bit there in the center so don't overcook it because you want the G so okay 40 minutes actually I'm gonna look at it 35 I'm sorry I couldn't wait for y'all I had to go ahead and start tasting it I love a good butter cake mmm I'll cook this for 40 minutes y'all mmm oh I meant Dania if you don't want to fool with making it from scratch you can find these at where Paula Deen Stowell Paula Deen calm if you want a little help from your friends mmm and if you come up with a different one let me know I'm nuts my goose;['postres']
0LLfKTkoWVM.json;i got my boyfriend stan the candy man in the kitchen with me today i'm a happy chick stan is the owner of savannah candy kitchens and he's gonna help me to make your chocolate dreams come true today first up for all you sweet tooth lovers is our chocolate explosion cheesecake doesn't that look delicious look at this y'all and then stan makes one of his favorites a chocolate almond brickle brown sugar and butter i don't think that could be anything but good and to round off this chocolate fairy tale today a new friend stops by to help me with a hazelnut filling for our fabulous chocolate cream puffs you know there's always room for chocolate stan is the man here in town he is a dear dear friend and i love him to death he owns savannah candy kitchens here in town so for all you chocolate lovers this show is for you we are gonna make a chocolate explosion cheesecake today y'all and it's gonna take the entire show for us to put this cheesecake together stand because it's a dad gum many layers to it i don't care if it takes all day like if we eat some at the end stan is chopping some almond shell he's getting ready to make almond bread not brittle brickell brickle what's the difference between breakfast i believe it's a lot softer i didn't realize the difference between brickell and brittle y'all but i'm gonna start putting our cheesecake together now i have dropped in six tablespoons of butter to my double boiler here i'm gonna add two eggs six ounces of chocolate a half a cup of sugar two tablespoons of flour and we're just gonna just cook this on top of the the stove over the boiling water just till the chocolate melts y'all then we're gonna put it on our graham cracker crust and you can go on foodnetwork.com if you need the recipe for the graham cracker crust look at that butter popping it up butter makes it better immediately yes immediately all right so this is looking good [Music] all right if you'll pass me that crust i think everything is melted in here i'm going to turn this uh off and i'm just going to pour this in no you you got many nuts to chop so i'm just gonna pour this in here we're gonna put this in a 300 degree oven y'all and we're gonna bake it for 15 minutes and then we're going to pull it out and we're going to put another layer on top of this layer this is truly just the beginning and i'm just going to spread that out okay i'm going to have a caramel layer and another chocolate layer all right so in the oven this goes 15 minutes 300 degrees stand all right stan let's get started on your chocolate almond brickle so i'm gonna move this pot stand and we can move your brickel pot up and you tell me what to do what we want to do first we want to add two sticks of butter right there see i knew i loved staying they're on medium heat okay we're gonna get that melted we need a cup and a half brown sugar and we wanted to cook this to about 280 degrees but we want to stir it the entire time but not over stir it okay because if you over stir it it'll give it too much air in it and we don't want that either we want it to be firm but not brittley and there's a difference between brickell and brittle litany yes and i really believe it's the temperature brittle is cooked to 300 to 310 brick call is around 280. okay uh stan there's nothing more important than a thermometer candy making bacon it's all a formula i don't really think you can take a chance on that and candy making bacon it will a degree will really make a huge difference yeah now while we why i'm doing this paula let me get this almonds on the tray okay if i drop these on the floor that's gonna be bad well we'll just pick our nuts up off the floor and keep getting it it wouldn't be the first time i have dropped this on the floor you see that how that looks almost like the praline it sure does what's that thermometer now i don't know i'm gonna have to turn around here to me all right it's almost up to 270. i would say it's at 266. you sure that mm-hmm so you ready to take it out okay because if it gets over that it will get too hard for you okay so you're just gonna pour that for the nuts okay oh my gosh now we'll spread it evenly okay let it sit for about five minutes then we can add our chocolate our morsels and we're using milk chocolate today you want me to just sprinkle this on evenly this has got to melt so we got to put it on the chocolate chip i want to make sure you're not short on that yeah and you can change this you could do a cup and a half cup and a quarter yeah i might even like two cups if i but you know you can go with what you like you can make the thickness i got about two cups here so i don't think that hurts rules and recipes are made to be broken well they're made to fit your taste buds if you like a little more chocolate what's that going to happen look i'm just going to kind of bang that in there but we still got to get the thickness like we want it because the taste is not going to change but we want it to look pretty tupac oh okay look at this see there and we put those chocolate chips on it y'all while that that brickle was still hot it's correct mountain oh my gosh it looks delicious all right we're gonna put this in the refrigerator for 20 minutes i better do that okay while you're doing that i'm gonna wash my hands y'all go to your kitchen get your cup of coffee and come back

cookies and Maggie's decadent brownies so y'all stick around you his show makes me want to Paris yep do you know why because it's all about sweet stuff today I'm gonna be doing an ice cream social and I'm gonna be doing some goodies that are so tasty along with the ice cream I've got my basket of strawberries that we're gonna be using in a few minutes but why don't we get started with our ice cream the first ice cream I'm gonna make today is a butter pecan and so I'm gonna start by melting a tablespoon of butter I'm gonna toss the pecans in there and let them toast and I'm gonna watch them carefully because we don't want them to scorch because if they scorch you're no good so we're just gonna let those lightly Brown right there and then I'm gonna drain them on a little paper towel I'm gonna come over here and I've got three cups of whole milk not 2% not that diet stuff three cups of whole milk and to that I'm gonna add one can of evaporated milk and now understand that that is evaporated not condensed milk some people don't get those two confused alright and I'm gonna add to this a small pack of vanilla pudding you can see our ice cream is gonna be really really a nice pretty yellow that smelling so good I'm gonna add a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla all right now today I'm using one of the little counter ice cream makers you can use this in that type of ice cream maker or you can use it in a regular ice cream churn so our Bowl has been in the freezer for 24 hours we're gonna turn it on and this is very important that you turn your machine on first because if you pour your ice cream mixture in it will immediately freeze to the sides of it and then your your blade won't go on I'm just gonna slowly pour our ice cream mixture into the freezer all right so I'm gonna let this churn until the ice cream really starts to thicken so while that's churning let's come on over here I'm gonna be making a strawberry sorbet all right I'm gonna add two cups of sugar to 2 cups of ball in water and I'm gonna mix those up and then we're gonna need to let this cool after that sugar entirely melts in that hot water and I've got some back here that has already melted and cooled all right so let's come over here and we'll put our strawberries in our food processor and I'm just gonna puree them they smell so good and now I'm gonna add 1/4 of a cup of fresh lime juice and that's going to give it a real part taste alright okay alright we've got our strawberries pureed up nice nice and fine alright now I'm just gonna bring them over here and I'm gonna run them through this sieve and this is gonna remove all the seeds that the strawberries have and I'm gonna help it along by stirring them around strawberries are a beautiful color aren't they so I'll just say that now to our strawberry juice I'm gonna add a half a cup of white corn syrup and I'm just gonna stir that around alright now the last thing I'm gonna add is our simple syrup that we made earlier and we allowed it to cool so our ingredients are nice and cold you can make this earlier in the day put it in the refrigerator measuring cup because I don't trust myself to hit that hole with the ingredients in them in the bowl so and I'm gonna do the same thing with this one I'm gonna slowly add my strawberry puree all right there we go that's gonna be wonderful so now it's time to add the butter pecan to our vanilla base alright so I'm just gonna slowly add these and let the machine have a chance to mix those in so this just looks great so I'm gonna take a minute to clean up get everything out of the way because I can't hardly wait to taste this ice cream in this sorbet so while I'm cleaning up grab you a cup of coffee and I'll meet you back here in like two minutes [Music] [Music] hey y'all I'm just fixing to put this in the storage containers and throw it in the freezer all right so I'm just gonna pour this in the container and I'm gonna throw it in the freezer and let that get nice and hard and I've already got a strawberry sorbet poured up and you can see it's really really loose it's I'm really poured it up and a soft-serve state because I'm gonna put it in the freezer and let it finish hardening and I've already got some that it's gotten hard you can see what it looks like and you can see how pretty that is and how fine gosh I can't wait to taste it but I think I'm gonna taste this one because it's still nice and soft give me brain freeze mmm oh my gracious mmm I don't put this up and get it out of my way I'm not gonna finish with these other two things that I want to show you so I better put this away I'll just wind up standing there eating ice cream for the next 30 minutes and all the sponsor so canceled and then I won't have a show but I'll be nice and full all right I want to show you a wonderful ginger cookie this is gonna be so so good with our butter pecan ice cream now I'm gonna start with 3/4 a cup of shortening I'm gonna add a cup of sugar I'm gonna add one egg and 1/4 of a cup of molasses oh it smells so good I love molasses gosh it almost tastes like a strong cane syrup it's so good all right now we're just gonna take these ingredients and we're gonna blend them up real good last it took it a while you can see what a nice rich color that molasses turn this into now we're going to come over here I've got two cups of all-purpose flour I'm going to add two teaspoons of baking soda a teaspoon of cinnamon a teaspoon of ginger and a half a teaspoon of cloves and a pinch of salt now I'm just gonna stir this up and we're gonna dump it over into our shortening and molasses mixture that we've got over here I'm just gonna give that a little stir all right I'm gonna try to swing that batter am i swinging it on y'all [Laughter] okay here we go all right now I'm gonna take these and I'm gonna roll them into a small bowl a little larger than a marble and I've got some just plain granulated sugar right there I love my ice cream right now I'm just gonna toss these around in the sugar okay I've got my oven preheated to 350 degrees and we're gonna bake these for about 12 minutes and while those are baking I want to come over here and show you Maggie's decadent brownies and they are decadent now I've got me a 13 by 9 by pin that's been greased right here got my two sticks of butter and my four squares of semi-sweet chocolate melted so I've turned off the fire and to that I'm gonna add two cups of granulated sugar and I'm gonna add one cup of all-purpose flour and a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm gonna just mix that up and I think I'm gonna take it off the heat because I don't want it to cook my eggs that's a lot of chocolate looks and smells delicious all right I'm gonna come up here and I'm gonna add my four eggs okay so we got our four eggs in there I'm just gonna mix those up good I'm gonna pour that into our prepared pan and we're gonna put it in a 350 degree oven and we're gonna bake it for about 25 minutes well we ain't finished with them yet either when we come back I'm gonna show you how I finish them up or hi Maggie finishes up and we're gonna be tasting those wonderful ginger cookies so I'll see y'all back in a couple of minutes [Music] [Music] so y'all look at what I got ginger cookies don't they look good I love the cracks in them I gotta find something to put them on oh these look delicious and here I'm there already Chris is there hitting the plate I can tell that they're gonna be really nice and crunchy oh they're gonna be perfect with that ice cream all right you're probably saying well those brownies don't look so decadent to meet Paulo well let me show you the really decadent part of these brownies well this is like deja vu because in this bowl I've got two more sticks of butter and four more squares of semi-sweet chocolate so those that are counting this brownie now has one full pound of butter in it four sticks all right I've got that melted so I'm gonna turn that off now I'm gonna bring it over here this is gonna be like our icing for these brownies I'm gonna use 1/2 a cup of an egg substitute a pasteurized egg I'm gonna pour that in there along with some vanilla and one box of confectionery sugar it's just one little box y'all all right we're gonna mix that up most frostings do call for a whole box of confectioner sugar but I have to tell y'all most brownie recipes don't call for four sticks of butter all right now I'm gonna add four cups of marshmallows and I'm gonna stir them quickly because I don't want them to melt I want you to be able to see them and this particular recipe reminds me so much of my wilmington Island Marsh mud cake gosh it's so good all right well let's take our brownies out of the oven all right let's take our brownies out and I'm just gonna pour this icing on top of them [Laughter] Maggie's decadent brownies I think the name suits the recipe all right now I'm gonna just spread that over look at that YUM all right I'm gonna take this brownie I'm gonna let it cool and then I'm gonna stick it in the refrigerator but I'm gonna just sitting back here came out of my eyesight so I won't be tempted I just adore melted chocolate oh now I've got one that's cooled back here waiting on me so let's cut this one and see how it's gonna look we're gonna make four lines of brownies gonna go to something a little bit smaller to get that first piece out with Margaret Cho I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself girl those look wonderful but you all know what I want to taste I want to taste that one back there that's hot and the chocolates all melted and since this is my show I think I can do what I want to look at that y'all look at it running down that spoon hmm so y'all give me a minute excuse us while we come back I'm gonna show you how to turn a snowball into a delicious ice cream [Music] I got some nice tips for y'all today I know you're thinking Paulo what are you doing that big ol bowl of snow in front of you in Georgia well believe it or not once in a while a freak thing will happen well in 1973 we had a huge snowstorm we had 17 inches of snow and there was a housekeeper that lived across the street it was a dark a widow doctor and he had two little boys and and made us a big old bowl of snow ice cream it was the best thing ever putting my mouth hadn't had him he says 1973 but I'm gonna show y'all how a team a made it she went out got a big ball of snow she took a can of condensed milk and poured it into that snow [Music] she added some vanilla flavoring and she just mixed all that up and I tell y'all what I couldn't believe that snow could taste so good [Music] but how wonderful is that ice cream just doesn't get any better and Eddie Mae was probably in her late 50s or 60s so that she's no longer with us but and he may just know wherever you are I think about you and that snow ice cream that day it's just the best stuff in the world look it's better than any ice cream you'll ever eat thanks Eddie make y'all I have to say that I love my work every show that I do I love but some I have to tell you I really love a little bit more than others and today's show is one of those between the butter pecan ice cream and the strawberry sorbet and the ginger cookies and for goodness sakes Maggie those decadent brownies are unbelievable but I have to tell you the thing that I enjoy doing most today Eddie Mae's snow ice cream was my very very favorite today to make and eat and I hope you'll enjoy all the other recipes we've made today and as always I've loved every minute that I've spent with y'all I thank you for coming and until next time y'all I send you loving best dishes from my kitchen to yours;['postres']
1c2BZjoYe9I.json;- Well, hey friends, y'all come on in. Here in Savannah, we are knocking on St. Patrick's days door. You know, it's a huge celebration. A lot of Catholic Irish people live here. And I mean, it's a big, big celebration, religious to a lot of locals and party time for a lot of. people visiting our city. So I know I've told. y'all many, many times, but Savannah is the second. largest celebration of St. Patrick's day in the country, only second behind New York City, so we're serious about St.. Patrick's day down here. So for the next few videos,. I'm gonna be doing things that if you happen to be. celebrating St Patrick's day, or even if you're not, you know, got some shirts that say,. well kiss me, I'm Irish, or just kiss me. It don't. matter what I am. (laughing) I don't know. But anyway, this is. called an Irish cream cake and was this in the magazine? Did this come outta Cooking. with Paula Deen Magazine? So I love it because. it's a tried and true. And the other reason I love it is because I'm starting with a cake mix. If you learn how to doctor. up things like this, it makes life so easy y'all.. So I got my cake mix in here. It's just mix, mix, mix, and. I'm gonna pour my eggs in here and my oil, and I've got two tablespoons. of coffee, instant coffee. Where is the handle? There it is. That we dissolved in a cup of water. So all that just goes in here and we're gonna beat it. for like two minutes. Okay, so that cake mix y'all. makes it so easy. I love it. So we're gonna put this in. two, nine inch cake pans. And if y'all watched the video when I made my grandmother's. red velvet cake, I showed you a couple of tricks about ensuring that your cakes come out good. I remember one cake, I. didn't follow my own advice. (laughing) You know, that. fig cake, my goodness. Half came out and half. stayed in. (chuckles) All right. So, you know, I've. told y'all before I do this I just try to get 'em as even as I can. So I just use my cup. So, these cake pans are. lined with wax paper y'all so I know those cakes are. gonna come out nice and clean. Now this cake appeared to have. a lot of air bubbles in it. So I'm gonna bring it over here. Can you see that in? Can you see the bubbles coming to the top? 'Cause, you know, I. just don't want my cake to have a lot of holes in it. I banged them y'all and there's still a lot of bubbles on top. You can see 'em and. maybe if I bang them five or 10 more times, but. you see those bubbles? So we just gonna have. some bubbles this cake. Okey dokey. I am. preparing now the frosting for our Irish cream cake. And you can see how good they came out, but little air bubbles,. but that's all right. I'm not going sweat it. So the frosting is just as. easy as the cake was y'all. I used a fourth of a cup. of Baileys Irish cream. Now you can get less expensive. brands than this one. So it's up to you, but. that's what we used. And I added one and a half tablespoons of instant coffee to this. So. we're just gonna beat up our two sticks of butter. until it's nice and creamy. And then I'm gonna add. my coffee and my Baileys. And then I'm gonna add one cup of 4X sugar until I have it all incorporated. And we're gonna frost the top. and the sides of this cake and when I get it all frosted, I'm gonna go around the side of the cake, and just pat these almonds, these slivered almonds onto just the side. I like a lot of nuts y'all. Y'all wanna make sure that. you stop a couple of times and just scrape around your bowl to make sure all your. ingredients get mixed up. Now it's time to add our sugar. I don't know why they make these cords so it don't wanna sit right. So about a cup at a time until. I have it all incorporated. And that is four cups of confection sugar. But remember at the end of this video you'll have the complete directions and amounts for this recipe. So if you didn't get it while. we doing it, not to worry. All right and the last. of the 4X sugar goes in. And if I find this is too thick for me, I may cut it with a. little bit of heavy cream or half and half farm milk. But I'm gonna check out the thickness. It looks like it's gonna. be a very thick frosting. And remember to stop your. mixer every couple of times and scrape down the sides so you won't have clumps of things that didn't get mixed together. And this frosting is very, very thick. So I'm gonna add I think I'll. start with like a tablespoon because confectionate sugar. can become very liquidy quick using just a little bit of liquid. Just adding a little bit of liquid, it can take it down quick. And you know, I've always told you I have a hard time following my recipe even if it's my recipe. (chuckles) So I'm gonna add a little bit. of my pure vanilla extract. That you'll find in our. stores now. So good. It's not a flavoring. It's the real deal. I'm ready to start the frosting procedure. I'm gonna put a little dab of frosting just right there in the center so that my cake won't slide around on me. Now some people, if they're. looking for a perfect cake they'll slice this top off so it'll be completely flat, but not me because tasting good and having as much cake as I can get means more than it being totally flat. So I just wanna make sure. that that's in the center and it looks like it's in the center. And we're gonna frost layers and sides. Look how perfectly even these cakes are. Totally the same size. Now, this is the way I. like to frost my cakes. I like to put me a big old glob. towards the edge of my cake. And then I like to bring. that down on the sides. To me, it's just, I can. seem to do a better job doing it that way. Okay. I just wanna clean up my. cake plate just a little bit before I start putting the almonds and I should have torn pieces of wax paper and put under this so I could. have just pulled them out and kept a nice clean. edge, but I didn't do that. So what I'm gonna do is. just pat those almonds onto the sides of the cake and then I'll come back. and get what didn't stick. So that's it. Look how. beautiful that cake is. And you saw how little. effort it took to make it. I mean, it's looks like you worked on it for hours and hours. Y'all, it kinda tastes. like coffee ice cream. I love me some blue. bells coffee ice cream. And this is what it tastes like to me. In fact, a scoop of that would. be very good on this cake. It's just a pretty cake. That coffee just gives it. the prettiest shade of brown. It's delicious. Happy St. Patrick's day to me. (chuckles) Yum.;['postres']
1dLujrs1FIw.json;"- Hi y'all, I decided to. do y'all a favor today. I've shot so many videos without hair, without makeup and looking. like the wicked witch. So I decided to dress up for y'all today. So I wouldn't hurt their eyes Teresa I didn't want to hurt anybody's eyes. Actually I'm telling a big fat story with some jewelry TV this morning, so. - [Teresa] So you had to get dressed. - I had to have hair and makeup today. - [Teresa] Well you look pretty well. - Well, thank you. Emily does an incredible job. In fact, Michael says. she's not a beautician. She is a magician. (laughing) She can wait for one. and change me totally. All right. So, you know, it's almost Christmas. Every Christmas I make what. I named Jamie's coconut cake. And I think it's a very first recipe in The Lady And Sons Dessert Books. What is the name of that book? The Lady And Sons Just Desserts. Yeah, I was gonna say, no way. (laughing) Bobby's favorite cake was caramel and Jamie's favorite cake was coconut and I'm in between there y'all. I would never throw a. caramel cake out the door and I'd never throw a. coconut cake out the door, but I think coconut is. winning just a little bit. Alright, so sweet Teresa went. ahead and baked off our cakes because I know that's. probably pretty boring for y'all to sit through and watch because I'm sure most of y'all. have actually baked a cake. And I think this is in The Lady And Sons, Savannah Country cookbook.. - It is.. - I think. Because I pulled out a few. of my really favorite sweets and put them in just desserts - I've never made this cake this way. - You've never made this cake, okay. - I would tell them what's all in it. - There is so many ways. to make a coconut cake. There is some really. simple, simple, simple easy ways to make coconut cake. like using a box cake mix, putting some coconut flavoring or using unsweetened coconut milk in place of the milk. that you put in the cake and doing a heavy cream frosting, top it with coconut and you're there. So but I'm doing the one. that is the most trouble but if you'll go to my. website, you can see others. Or if you have my cookbook,. you can probably find others. So I'm just gonna walk. you through this cake. You're gonna need, Oh, I'm. doing the S on the frosting. Let me get to the cake 'cause I've got the frosting, I've got the filling and then I've got the recipe for the cake. All right. So I make for my coconut cake what they call a one,. two, three, four cake. And how it got its name. way back in the day was it's one cup of sour cream. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - No, it's one cup of. - Here it is. All right it's one cup of milk, two cups of sugar, three cups of sifted. self-rising flour and four eggs. So that's one, two, three, four. - [Teresa] And that. wasn't a one cup of milk, it's one cup of butter. - Well, it says one cup of milk unless it's been printed up wrong. - [Teresa] It may Okay,. one, two, three, four. It's actually one cup of butter, two cups-- - This has two sticks of. room temperature butter. - [Teresa] Mmmh. - Two cups of granulated sugar. Come on in, you look all right. - No. - Four eggs, three cups. of self-rising flour, one cup of milk and one. teaspoon of vanilla extract. - And you know why the one cup milk? I forgot about the one cup milk is because I use sweetened condensed. I mean, I used no, I used the coconut what you told me to do the-- - Coconut milk. - [Teresa] So I'm not. thinking milk, milk, sorry. - Okay. Okay. And that is all right,. because sometimes I don't know if you took this directly. out of The Just Desserts Book but sometimes in translation. they can get messed up but okay. Seven minute icing I'm. gonna put that down. All right. So I tell you to, for the directions, for the one, two three, four cake, substitute coconut milk. in place of regular milk, it will give your cake just. a more of a coconut flavor. And while this cake is baking, we're gonna prepare our filling. But I'm gonna walk you through. putting this cake together. So it, you need three prepared. pans to put this thing in and you want to cream your. butter, which is two sticks. You wanna cream that till it's fluffy and then you add two cups of sugar and continue to cream well. for six to eight minutes and then you add your eggs one at the time and you wanna beat them. well after each egg. So now we're down to our three cups of sifted self-rising flour. Now there's many flours out there, but in the baking world, Ellie the cauliflower cake flour, plain flour, or self-rising flour. The plain flour, the cake. flour speaks for itself. The plain flour has nothing in it. No salt, no nothing to make it rise, Your rising though, has all the stuff in there. to make your cake rise. Now, if all you have is plain flour, you can put, for three cups, you can put a teaspoon of salt in it, and maybe three teaspoons. full of baking powder, not soda, but baking powder. So you can turn plain. flour into self-rising. But you can't turn self-rising into plain 'cause remember you can always add to, but you can't take away. So when I was formulating. this recipe, I thought, well I'm just gonna go ahead. and use self-rising flour and that'll eliminate the. salt and the baking powder, baking soda, whatever. So one more time, two sticks. of room temperature butter, two cups of granulated sugar, four eggs, three cups of sifted self-rising flour, one cup of coconut milk. And if you can't find coconut milk, it comes in a Canyon right Teresa? Didn't you find it in a Canyon? - Yes. - And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. And usually I will use. vanilla teaspoon of vanilla and maybe a teaspoon of coconut extract. So that gives it a little bit more flavor, and we're gonna bake. these for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. And you're gonna want. to cool them in the pan five to 10 minutes. And then I like to invert my cakes onto a piece of wax paper on my rack. All right, so. We're gonna add our eggs one at the time. I think that's where I left off beating well after each addition, and then we gonna start adding our flour along with our milk. And you wanna always start. with flour and end with flour. And I don't know the reason, but somehow adding that flour first and last it just makes far much creamier batter. But like I said, I'm no scientist. So I don't know why, but I. have found that to be the case. So you'll want to maybe do. it in four to five steps, your flour and then maybe a. fourth a cup of your milk. So anyway, you just have to work it out. So that, that flour is a first. of those two ingredients. And the last of those two ingredients. And I like to use in my cake pans, I like to use the spray that's for bacon, because it's got your grease and your flour all in one can. And I never have a problem. when I use that kind. All right, so we got our cakes. ready and they've cooled. So what I'm gonna do next? I didn't know if I had a, I. usually use a wooden spoon but, we're in the process. of reconstruction here. So I don't have a lot to work with but I think that makes a. little too big of a hole. I don't know we'll see. - [Eddie] There's some. dowels on that, cabinet. - Oh it is. Okay. So I was using my beater which is working out pretty good. There's some dowels, where? - [Eddie] On the left hand, right there. - Oooh!. - Is that too big? - No, it's a little smaller Eddie almost. It's almost the same size, but like I said I'll use the grabber, but that made a right. good size hole, let's see. And I just go around and stick holes all in the top because we're gonna put a filling in this cake and we want it. to seep down in to this cake, making it even more moist. All right, so we'll go. ahead and do this one. I don't like to get it. pretty close to the edge. 'Cause sometimes the. edges can be a little dry. It tastes pretty good Teresa. - Yay.. - I'm having to clean off my spoon so I can keep. making holes (laughing) It's good y'all. Way to go Teresa.. - Yay! All right, now I'm gonna come. over here and just make a few big ones so it'll act like your others do. Mmh, real good. Really, really good. All right. So I'm gonna mix up a filling that I just love to put in the center of this cake, just because it's so good. And you know, I don't measure these, but I had to try to measure it so I could share it with y'all. So you may want to adapt this to the way you. want it, but all right. Let's, imma put back on those glacess My eyes are getting more certain more so where did I put them? Here they are (laughing) It's hard to keep up with them when you don't have them on, all right I'm, got three fourths a cup of sugar, I've got one eight ounce. package, a carton of sour cream and you don't wanna use low. fat or anything like that. We're making a coconut. cake, so let's go whole hog or go home and I'm going whole hog. And we've got half a. cup of flaked coconut, which to me, is really not enough. Teresa has me some, you with me Eddie? Theresa has me some extra. coconut so I can fix that. And like I said, I just. mix this stuff up together and stick my finger in there and see if it's sweet enough to suit me. All right. So this is kind of stiff. This filling is kind of stiff. So I found that if I wanted. this to soak into my cake that I was gonna need to. add some liquid to it. So I just thin it with some milk and let's see down said how much milk? Four tablespoons of milk. Just get it to the. consistency that you want. I may need to add some more milk. Just depends on how I'm feeling. I'm definitely gonna add some coconut. Because this is the only coconut let's see I'll put it in here so y'all can kind of see what I'm doing. This is the only coconut. it's gonna be actually inside your cake. Naturally, we'll have. it on the top off it. All right that's pretty good. But you know what? I still want it maybe a bit thinner. So I'm gonna just grab the milk. Okay. Y'all I went and. got a little bit more milk because I just don't think. that's thin enough enough to run through the holes. that I've made on the cakes. So I'm adding a little bit more and depending on how much filling you want you could easy double this recipe, and it's guesswork to do. this and we'll see if it's I think it's sweet enough,. but is it thin enough? All right, now we started. with four tablespoons of milk. So you may wind up with. somewhere around seven or eight tablespoons, but just use your judgment as. to where you want it to be. Alrighty I'm gonna take my first layer and you want to have to be careful how you put your cake together because sometimes all your. layers are not the same size. and sometimes they kind of lopsided. - [Teresa] I did good,. they're not lopsided. (laughing) - You know what? You did good Teresa - [Teresa] I realized that. my oven is not leveled. - Absolutely, if you. don't do a lot of baking, there is a good chance. All right. So I'm gonna kind of. want to keep this as even as I can for each layer. So I'm gonna put it down with my measuring cup and this. is, yeah, it's a half a cup. Now, I wanna make sure I. spread this out real even. All right, we'll come back in a bit more because I want this. That looks really good. So we're putting a filling. All right I want to see if I. should use a little bit more. Maybe just a little bit, but not much. Okay. So let's take this layer first. So you can see that this layer is higher than this layer. So we want to put the thinnest part - Look at how even that is now. - on the thickest part of the cake. Anyway, so that levels it up, it's important where your shapes. And do we have any toothpicks kiddos here? In this house? - [Eddie] Yeah, should be. - [Paula] Should be up here somewhere? - [Eddie] In the right corner. - Oh, Hey you're so smart. So, I put toothpicks in it at this point. So my cake won't slide everywhere. So here we go, I'm gonna. start with the same amount. Then I did put a bottom layer and you can see it's running out now. Yay. Okay. So we're gonna. spread that out real good. And it's just gonna. seep down in those holes and I love it when a. good plan comes together. Yes. All right. Now here's what I'm gonna have to do. I'm gonna have to try to measure out what I have left because if I have enough I wanna be able to put. some more on this layer. So I'm gonna do this. Oh my gosh. I really don't have a lot. extra to put on this layer so, I'm gonna get every drop I can though on this. So you see why I kept. adding more milk to it? I'm sure y'all see the reasoning for that. All right, now. Oh, no Theresa told me. that she had (laughing) had a little accident. coming out of the oven. Out of the pan, but look Theresa. That's all right. 'Cause you know what? I'm just gonna glue that. right back together. Look at that, Brand new. Oh, I see that little crack. Did you about dukey in your pants Teresa? - [Teresa] Yeah, say what's you say. - All right now, where is our lowest side? This point. I'm not sure it goes to this cake but I can fix all this. with our seven minute icing that's gonna go on it so, no problem. You just stay glued up there. Okay. So coming here with toothpicks so that little sucker. won't go anywhere on us. It's amazing What that sweetened sour cream does to this cake y'all. 'cause it's kind of tart. I mean, I'm trying to get. blood from a turnip right now. I'm trying to get every. bit of that liquid gold. I mean that icing, see why. I wanted to kind of measure. So I'd have a good idea that I didn't get to the top layer and hardly. have anything for yet. So perfect, we did a good job kids. All right. Yeah. Teresa, it doesn't matter. You know, that layer Got heavier size than others. It doesn't matter because. our seven minute icing is gonna be so fluffy and so thick. So I can always put more icing on this side and less on. that side where it's high. So it is nothing to worry about. So, but here's the deal. on this cake y'all, which is the hardest part for me. I tell you to stick. this in the refrigerator for three days, three days and three nights because we want to give that frosting or filling time to seep. all through that cake. And that's what makes. this cake so delicious it said it is drank up. that wonderful filling. So I guess that we're gonna pretend like it's been three days, if y'all won't tell, I won't tell. So, Oh my goodness, it's been three days. I'm so ready to put the seven. minute icing on this cake. So I just want to take a minute and clear off right here,. because believe it or not I actually have burners under this riser. So we're gonna stop. filming just long enough for me to clean this up and then imma share with you the making of seven minute. icing, which is so divine. So divine. Just that quick y'all we. got this all cleaned off and fixed to make that seven minute icing. So let's start off by saying we're gonna pretend like it's. pouring down rain outside. You can not make this. icing when it's raining. If there's too many, too. much humidity in the air it will not get hard. So put it away until a sunny day. But we're lacking today 'cause we've got a bright sunny day. So here are the measurements. I've got my boiling water,. boiling at a pretty rapid pace. And I'm using a glass bowl. and you wanna make sure that that water does not. touch the bottom of your bowl because it will make your. seven minute icing grainy and you don't want that to happen. But so in this bowl, we're. gonna add one and a half cups of sugar and let's see how much. cream of tartar did it say? A fourth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar. Okay. Normally I use,. just the white karo syrup. Okay. So there's a fourth of. a teaspoon of cream of tartar and we need one and a half. teaspoons of vanilla flavoring. So I'm gonna put one tablespoon (laughing) because I love the flavor of. vanilla extract in this icing. All right. Our coconut, we're gonna save. (mixer whirring) whoa! This is fast mixer. So we're putting our two egg whites, a third of a cup of water and we gonna beat this for one minute. And I'm putting like a dash of salt. So that's it. That is it for right now. I'm gonna turn this up and we need to beat this for one minute. So Theresa, if you can. give me one minute, please. - [Teresa] One minute on the timer. (mixer whirring) - Oh, Teresa hadn't said it,. but I think it's been a minute 'cause I had already started beating it before she said anything, so (mixer whirring) - Now you have seven minutes.. - Seven minutes. So be careful with your cord, I told you about my cousin's wife. I asked her to do this part, I look over there and. my cord was in flames which she just let it drape in the fire so we got her butt out of. the kitchen pretty quick. And put her back on the computer. (mixer whirring) seven minutes exactly, Teresa. Okay it's been seven minutes y'all. And I've took a bowl off the boiling water. and you see how I did. I really didn't have a double bowl so you can always make. your double bowling using (mixer whirring). a bowl and I call them bowlers. Now so we've taken that off the heat and we're gonna beat it. until it's spreading. Consistency is the way I want it. (mixer whirring) (background noise drowns out speaker) but my mother made the best, in the whole entire world. it was so beautiful. It was glossy, white and glossy and full. of nuts, it was wonderful. All right, now I'm gonna. put our spatula down in here and see if I think that's. the right consistency. You know what? It might could take a little bit more. So I just want to be sure that it doesn't fall off of our cake (mixer whirring) I wonder what would happen. if I put some butter in this? I bet it'd be delicious. Now I hope that I can find a butter knife. Now like to use just a spoon and a regular knife. Bakers normally use one of those offset. You know where it goes. I don't like that. I can't, I just can't operate it. So now, Oh my gosh. Y'all I assume is slap could have perfect. Look at that. Don't that look like a heavenly cloud and an angel should come out off it. Yes. All right. So now this. is the way I frost mine. I put my icing up on the edge and then I start kind. of just pulling it down. I know one time I was (laughing). on Martha Stewart show and I know I've told this story too, and you know I think she. was kind of leery of me as far as what would come out of my mouth. You were with me choice. And I said, ""Martha, can. I ask you a question?"" And she very hesitantly said, ""Yeah."" I said, ""Where do you start when you're icing your cakes?"" (laughing) I know she was so relieved. to hear that question (laughing) because I know it probably scared her that I was gonna go somewhere. she didn't wanna go. But I would never have done that. Never, never, never. But yeah, that when I put. it on the edge like that it just gives me a place. to see it, my extra icing. Oh, this cake is gonna be so good. - [Teresa] We are cutting into it right? - Of course we cuttin into it honey. - [Teresa] Just making. sure you're not gonna try to save that for somebody. - Oh no, no. This seven minute icing doesn't really hold for a whole bunch a long time. So anyway, anytime I make a coconut cake there's really none left over, 'cause I'm feeding 35 to 40 people. So I never have to worry about. that icing sitting around and turning back to sugar. - [Eddie] There's no 35. to 45 people here today. Teresa, what are we doing?. - I know. I was just thinking about. how there's only a few of us. - I don't know. - [Teresa] That means lots of cake. - I'll pull my part of the. load if y'all will pull y'all's part of the load. - [Teresa] Oh, I never have. a problem pulling my load of a cake. I don't think Eddie does either. - I don't think he does either. As long as it's one that he likes. Like I said, the hardest. part about this cake y'all is putting it in the. refrigerator for three days. That's by far, the hardest. Look at that, see, when. I put it down on the edge it just kind of drapes down and I'm gonna have some cleaning up to do because I'm gonna be putting. coconut all over this this is as pretty a. icing, as I've ever made. Not grainy, 'cause sometimes when I make it, I'm relying on not just. looking at the clock or a little timer and I don't know that that's. always the best way to do this. I think Teresa put her phone on a timer and I think that's probably. the most reliable way. I bet y'all. See, if you made this cake and tried to put this icing. in between each layers, I mean, it would be fabulous. It would be fabulous, but I think you'd have to up the recipe, to have enough. So this way you're icing. this real thick on top And then you got your. filling in the center making it nice and moist. All right. Where is it lopsided? Where is it lopsided? I can still fix it Eddie. - [Eddie] It looks pretty. - [Teresa] I could say,. I don't see any lops. - Okay, good. Mh mh! All I need is some pink canyons. - [Teresa] I was gonna say. - And I'd have myself a piece of divinity. - [Eddie] Get some some walnuts. - Mh mh! Hey y'all I missed a. step and I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to wipe this. spoon off neck of this fork 'Cause I put it in my mouth. But I've stepped back and I could see where it. didn't come all the way to the cake plate. And I like it all the way to. the bottom of that cake plate. Okay. I think that's got all the holes. Now here's the step I missed. And I didn't think about till just now, I always, put two pieces of wax. paper under my first layer. So when I get through icing it I can just slip it out and. everything's nice and clean. But since I didn't do that, we're just gonna have. to clean up the mess. So this is the way I. handle doing the sides, I put my hand against the cake kind of pressing that coconut onto the side of that cake. And my leftovers I just bring them back up just like that. Stay on in the coconut. All right, Eddie are we gonna show them how I normally decorate this? - [Eddie] I don't know,. do we have any holy nuts? - I think we do.. - Yeah. - I think we do have holy nut bluish. - [Eddie] I'll go hunting. - Okay. Cause that makes it so pretty. - [Teresa] Why don't we take a break while you go grab some. - Okay, well I'll finish, I'll finish frosting this cake and Eddie's gonna go get some of the stuff that I like to have on my cake when I present it. to my family and my friends. Okay. Y'all we finished yet. Now I love at Christmas. time, to present my cake with holy on top. And normally, I will use an artificial, but if and I didn't have. any artificial today so we had to use the real thing. You definitely don't. want to eat any of these or allow anybody else to eat it. So what I do is I take. these and I wrap them in tenfold so that nothing is touching my cake. And then when I go to cut. it, I just take them out and making sure there's no. end 'cause these will wash really, really y'all in a warm soapy water to make. sure they're good and clean. But like I said, I think I. would just use the artificial so you don't have to worry about it. And there really is some pretty. artificial holy out there aint there Eddie.. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. So to make me feel better and knowing you're. okay, go get artificial. But this is a stunning. show stopper of a cake Merry Christmas to us (laughing) Loving best dishes y'all. Oh! Okay, y'all I had ended the. show with loving best dishes but you know what, as. soon as we cut the camera Eddie said, ""you're not. gonna it cutting it?"" I said, ""We'll cut it."" So I said, ""Yes, let's show them what our hard work yielded us."" And I start with my cake. straight down the center and this is the way my mother cut hers. So that's the way I've always cut mine. Look at that. Look at that. Now that's my favorite piece to get y'all. The end pieces. Oh my gracious. And then I just keep going. Just like this because I know cakes are. really pretty cutting wages but for some reason, it's more cake than I can eat and probably. most anybody can eat. So I just have found out. that I can yield more slices by doing it this way but you feel free to cut. it any way you want to. In fact, when I get into it. and I've got that part even, I can make like three slices out of it. Okay, here we go. Mh, mh! Okay. Here, y'all go. (laughing) - Yum yum.. - Oh my goodness. Bye now.";['postres']
1iC9abGWC6w.json;"- I have got such a treat for y'all today. And I hope that you're gonna appreciate it as much as I appreciated it when my grandmother Paul shared her recipe for red velvet cake with me. I've got all my stuff here but before we get started y'all, I want to just remind you to be sure and subscribe to my youtube channel and just click that. little notification bell and that way I will be. able to let you know that there's an announcement,. a video or something. So that's easy. Okay. This cake recipe calls for two eggs. So I've got them in my. bowl and I've beaten them. And now I'm going add. the sugar and beat that. And remember what I said a few. days ago, I think, you know the link to this recipe. is in the description. So if I don't tell you. exact, you can still get 'em. Okay. I've gotten our sugar and. our eggs mixed up real well. Now I'm gonna add cocoa. And the cocoa is really what sets it apart from a vanilla cake or a chocolate cake. That's what makes it a red velvet. So the recipe calls for a two ounce bottle. of red food coloring. I only have a one ounce bottle. So I'm gonna squeeze from. everything I've got in my cabinet that's red. Now. I like this food color right here. It's real strong. Just that little bit may be enough. All right, now I'm going add my two sticks of softened butter. It's funny how that little bit of cocoa, you'll be able to taste. it in the end results. (blender whirring) Whoa, slow down, Paula. Okay. In between your beatings, now, you need to scrape the sides of your bowl because you wanna make sure. everything's incorporated properly. Okay. We're on to the next step of. Grandma Paul's red velvet cake and I've got all the ingredients mixed up. And now I am gonna take my flour that I sifted and added salt to. And I have my one cup of buttermilk. So, I'm gonna alternate. these two ingredients. Always, always, start with. flour and end with flour. It just makes for a smoother cake. I'm not a scientist. I just know that to be a fact. Y'all, this is a project we've been working on. now for a good while. I am so proud to announce that we now have this pure vanilla extract in our stores. And I just love it in the brown bottle. You know, being in a brown. bottle that helps protect it from the sun and any kinda light. And that will keep it nice and strong. So this is in our stores. Where else can they find it? - [Woman] PaulaDeenshop.com - PaulaDeenshop.com. And like I said, it's in any of our, Okay. That's our vanilla. And the last step is I'm gonna add some. baking soda to my vinegar. And when that quits foaming,. I'm gonna throw it in. (blender whirring) Like I said, I'm not a scientist, but I think the vinegar. has something to do with the buttermilk. Okay, come on, get mixed up in there. Make sure it all gets in there. So if my grandma told. me to jump in a fire, I'd probably jump in a fire, ya'll. (laughing) (blender whirring) My grandmother said to. bake these cake layers in a 350 degree oven in. an eight inch cake pan. So that's what I'm using. And you can see that I. took a piece of wax paper. I laid the wax paper underneath the pan and with my scissors, I. marked the size of the circle because once you have put this much energy in making a cake, the last thing you want it to do is stick. So I'm also going to spray it with a non-stick that also has flour. And I'm gonna be using to make. sure my layers are proper, I'm going use a measuring. cup and go 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. And then in no time. they'll be in the oven. I cannot tell a lie. I lick the bowl. That red, that red is a dead. giveaway, what you're up to. Okay. So I got them measured. out the best I could. And so I wanna ask y'all, you know, my grandmother's icing is different from most red velvet cakes. So I would love to know. about y'all, you know, what has been the norm in your family and just what you do with yours. So let me know, you know, I. always love hearing from y'all. I just love it. So all y'all have to do is. just answer me in the comments. So the cake pans go in the. 350 degree preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Okay. I baked our cakes for 20. minutes and they are perfect. If you're unsure whether. your cake is done or not, you can actually feel in the center. And when it starts. pulling away from the pan, you know it's done and see. how easy those came out because I took the time. to use the wax paper. Ooh, I'll chew that off. (laughing) So you can see, I sprayed more wax paper because when I'm ready to put. 'em together and frost them, I don't want 'em sticking. to the wax paper. So that's it. All right. So, this is where I wanna hear from y'all. Because this was my grandmother Paul's recipe for the frosting. And she's the only one that I know of that has done it this way. But just remember, if you. wanna send me your recipe, send it to Pauladean.com. Questions@pauladean.com and to remind y'all again, the link to this recipe is. gonna be in the description. You wanna make sure that. your butter and cream cheese is at room temperature. And I put my marshmallows in the microwave for about... (laughing) I should have greased my fingers first. For about 20, 22 seconds. Those marshmallows are a sticky business. (laughing) Yeah, that works a lot better. Right, so in the mixer that goes. I don't know why Grandma didn't. just use marshmallow cream. I think that might have been easy-er. Or maybe they didn't. have marshmallow cream when she started making this. The next thing to go in, now that I've got the. marshmallows, the butter, and the cream cheese smoothed out, I'm going to add one box. of confectioner sugar. I'm gonna kind of add it slowly. (blender whirring) Kenzie, would you get my. vanilla flavoring please? I forgot to. I think I put it up. Good. Thank you. You wanna put me about. a teaspoon in there? That would be great. You don't have to measure. You're just do you. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. I thought you. said you couldn't cook. That marshmallow, that melted marshmallow,. Grandmama, made this extra thick. Now I'm just gonna stir in. my coconut and my pecans. Cause I don't want the mixer. to beat those up too badly. Now I'm going to add just a. little dollop of the icing to my pan. So my cake layers won't slide around. And some people will actually slice the little top off of cakes, but not me. I'm fine with it having a rounded top. I don't wanna lose any of my cake. So down goes the first layer and I wanna make sure. it's centered in my pan really, really well (laughing) - I'm gonna be sticking. to everything, ya'll. (laughing) - Okay, y'all, I put our third. and final cake layer up here. And to me, this is the easiest. way to, to frost the cake, when you're doing a whole cake. I like to put it around. the edge of my top layer and then bring it down. Because when you have an icing like this, that's full of different ingredients, it can be hard to frost. Oh My Grandmama, after all these years, I still miss you. But I'm so glad that you filled my mind with wonderful, wonderful memories that I can keep going. back to anytime I want to and keep that part of my life alive. And I hope y'all are the same way about your mothers and. grandmothers, grandfathers. So if you wanna chat about anything if you've got a question or a recipe, all you have to do is send it. to questions@pauladeen.com. The triplets are on their way over. So I'm not gonna cut the. cake right this minute. I'm gonna watch little. Olivia lose her mind because she walks in my. door saying, I want cake. I want cake, Ginny. (laughing) - Want cake. - I know you want cake! You always want cake when. you walk in Ginny's house. You always want cake. - All I want is cake. - You wanted that cake? - I wanted that cake. I wanted this one. - What do you want, Olivia? - I want this. - You want this? When you came in, you said ""Ginny I want cake."" - I want a cake. - Okay. That's what you're gonna get. But Ginny has to handle the knife. - Yes. - Yes. You're not ready. to handle a knife yet. Do you know what kind of cake this is? Or do you even care? - Yes. - You do care? What Milly? Oh, she knows where I. keep the soda crackers. - Soda crackers. - Look, that cakes red. It's red baby. - That's delicious. - No idea what she said. - More cake. - More cake ?! (laughing) - We look around here. She still got this much. and already asking for mo. More cake. - It's delicious. Yeah. You'll think this is a carrot cake. When you see from the outside. It's like a carrot cake, yeah. - [Paula] Now is Claudia's grandmother and she is from Venezuela. And this is Claudia's double cousin. - [Female] Double cousin, very important. - [Paula] Elisa. - [Female] Elise, the double cousin. - [Paula] I wanna call her Elsa because that's what I hear every time from the kids. It's Elsa, Elsa, Elsa. So I'm gonna have to call you Elsa. - [Elise] I'm dying to try this. - Okay. And can I tell you something else? Oops. Excuse me. Elise. (laughing) She is a conductor. I'd never met a conductor, ya'll. She, the family, She would never tell me that but they say she's famous in Venezuela. She is the only female. conductor in her country. So she's famous and everybody knows her. And now I'm so glad I know her. - No, I'm glad to be here. It's such a great honor. - Oh honey. It's an honor to have you. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome.";['postres']
1mPP9vQqKVM.json;- Hey, y'all. It's fall y'all. Can you believe... Isn't this like the. third day of fall, Eddie? Something like that? - [Eddie] Uh, no fall was last week. - Oh last week, okay. (Eddie laughs) - Well, I knew it was fall ya'll. - [Eddie] We are into fall. - And to me, (clears throat) Excuse me, to me in my. mind, when I think of fall, first thing I think of is that incredibly beautiful apple orchard I went in, in New York state. First time I'd ever. been in an apple orchard and it was just breathtaking. to ride in there and seeing these beautiful. green trees covered, just covered with red apples. So, I was so happy. You know, I'm always asking. what y'all are doing. I was so happy when a precious lady wrote to me. She wrote me the sweetest letter and she sent me a recipe for her mom's glazed, fresh, apple cookies. And it just had everything that I love. And she even sent me a picture. of her mother and father and look how cute they were. So cute. Just adorable. I know, I know that she misses her mother and daddy, and I know I do too. After all these years, I miss mine. But, this letter came in to me from Penny Warner, from Urbana, Missouri. So she said that both of our. parents passed away in 2019. And, she goes on to say, I just love the informality of your show. Since the pandemic, it. feels like I'm your friend in the kitchen, and you are Penny. That's. the way I hope that you feel. And I drink my coffee while I wait, watch you cook and bake. I hope you continue this format even after the world quits spinning backwards. I love you and just enjoy watching you and your staff, Michael, the boys and their precious family,. your extended family, and the pups too. Wishing you love and happiness, always.. Thank you so much, Penny. And I wish the same for you. And I so appreciate you sharing. your mom's recipe with me. And this is the picture, probably. one of the last pictures, taken of 'em. Look at him, and she, she's laughing. And she's (laughs) like, I don't know, she. said something to him. But that was her when her. mama was 17 years old. And this was her dad. He was an engineer at WWUP TV station in Cadillac, Michigan. And that was around 1965. That was the year I. graduated from high school. Whoa, what a year? It was so fun. All right. So here's her recipe and you're right, Penny, your mother had a beautiful handwriting. She had had a stroke, but she still, still had. a beautiful handwriting. Okay. So Kenny typed this up and this is what we're. going to have, ya'll. The cookie ingredients. are a half a cup of oleo. Well, for that we're. using butter flavored, solid shortening. And that's gonna go in our bowl. Good, I'm going to use that. as a spoon rest, right there. One and a third cup of brown sugar and in it goes. She said cream the oleo, brown sugar, and egg in a large mixing bowl. My hands are really not quite big enough to break it with one hand. And while we're creaming that, she said, in a large mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients together and let's see, add all dry ingredients. And she said, then mixing only half of the sifted, dry ingredients. Chopped nuts, chopped apples, and raisins to the cream mixture. So she said that we need to. see if the two cups of flour and a teaspoon of soda and a half teaspoon of salt, so. I'm gonna put this in the sifter and this is all purpose. flour that we're using. And we know that because. the recipe calls for soda and salt. So if it was self rising, it. wouldn't call for anything. All right. So here we go, with the salt, the baking soda, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, and that's fresh ground nutmeg. Any time you have an opportunity, I know it might be a. little bit of a pain to, to grate those little balls,. those little nutmeg balls, but by all means do it because. it makes such a difference. So we're gonna sift this. I think I could have gotten. a bigger bowl, couldn't I? (laughs) But why? Okay, it's almost all done. This is kind of reminding. me of an apple cake that I make my Aunt Beth Hires shared, Share a recipe with me for a - [Eddie] Your grand girls? - Grand girls. Apple pie from Georgia. (laughs) So we have got all of our dry ingredients, we have our raisins, we have our pecans and we have milk. So we're going to cream,. these ingredients. Okay. Hitting the green button. This when it flies like the wind, Eddie. All right. We're told, ya'll, to add half the flour mixture. Okay, now we have a fourth of a cup of just regular milk that I'm gonna pour in. Oh that's still so high. Now we're gonna add the other. half of our flour mixture. It didn't break! Sure. sounded like it, didn't it? Alright, and I think before I add the other things, I'm gonna just mix in that last part of the flour. So this is really, an easy recipe to make, Penny. And I so appreciate. you sharing it with us, because right now, you know, we're all thinking about Halloween and we're thinking about apples and gourds and pumpkins. Okay, now I think I'm just gonna stir in the nuts, raisins. And I just adore raisins. in my carrot cake, my cook, my oatmeal cookies. I just love the sweetness. And this only calls for one cup of chopped apples. I'm kinda surprised. I almost thought it would. call for more than that. Ooh, it smells so good. I've started trying to trying, trying, trying to eat an apple a day. Sometimes I can succeed and sometimes I can't - [Theresa] This way you're. gonna get to [Inaudible] - [Paula] Yes, that's exactly right. Okay. Looks delicious. Ms. Mildred didn't, that's her mother, that's Penny's mother, she didn't skimp on the nuts or the raisins. So that's good. Now we're gonna drop this. by the teaspoon full. And I have prepared my pan with actually some parchment paper and a silpat. I just really don't like it. when my cookie sticks, so, so I'm just gonna make sure they don't stick. And Penny says, drop about a teaspoon on a greased baking sheet,. so we're safe there. Now I'm going to, spray my little scooper duper and then we'll drop it by. mounded teaspoons full. I forgot to tell y'all. that on Penny's, mother's apple cookies, a glaze goes. on 'em while they're hot, straight out of the. oven. So I've got a cup and a half a confectioners sugar and calls for two cups of light cream, which I'm assuming would be half and half. - [Theresa] You mean two tablespoons? - [Paula] Two tablespoons,. why did I say teaspoons? - [Theresa] I think you said two cups. (laughs) - [Theresa] But, I may have heard wrong. - Listen, there ain't no telling. There ain't no telling, Theresa. So I'm using two and a half. tablespoons of heavy cream And it calls for a fourth of a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. That looks like a fourth. of a teaspoon right there. And a tablespoon. (objects crash over) Whoa, softened butter. And look at that. That's just. like a perfect tablespoon. Okay. And, the powdered sugar has been, has been sifted, so it won't be lumpy. You know what, I think we're gonna need a little bit more cream. Although, when this hits a hot cookie, it's gonna spread. Right now, it's hard.. All right, just a little. This may be a little thick because we're using heavy cream. instead of the light cream. So that could be the reason for the extra thickness ya'll. Like I said, as soon as. it hits that hot cookie, it's probably gonna spread - [Eddie] Yeah that's good,. that's the way I like it. - [Paula] like the flu. - [Eddie] Cinnamon rolls,. with that kind of icing on it. - [Paula] Yes, I'm afraid that for our pallettes, we're. not gonna have enough of the custard. You know, then I'm gonna have to come back and cream some out of this. Cause that's what makes it so good. Oooo! Eddie, ow, ow, ow. Ow! How do those look to ya? - [Eddie] They smell wonderful. - [Paula] They look pretty daggone good. Pretty daggone good. All right now, I just told Eddie that I was gonna have to try to resist. putting too much icing on each one of 'em. - [Theresa] Icing can always. be made. More can be made. - [Paula] Oh and listen,. don't you think I am above making some more icing, honey. All right, I'm just gonna put a little bit and see what that does to it. See if it does what I think it's gonna do. Mmm, I would like a little. bit of cookie with my cream. (laughs) It's not melting as fast. as I thought it would. All right. Which one. you want, Theresa, girl? - [Theresa] This one. - I know you wanted that one. - [Theresa] So glad you. asked first, before you take. - [Paula] Well I'm gonna take this one. (Paula laughs) - [Theresa] Oh, well you cheated! - [Paula] You spoke too soon. (Theresa and Paula laugh) - [Theresa] Eddie almost did it. - Uh huh. Eddie's watching.. I'm gonna take that off, I was just being funny. - [Theresa] Oh, you should leave it. - [Paula] I was just being funny. - [Theresa] These are... So good. - Tastes like apple cake, ya'll. - Oh my, that's exactly. what it tastes like, a small, moist, oh my gosh. Gotta go. Be sitting here (Paula laughs) - [Paula] Time to go. - Theresa said it's time. to go, so bye ya'll. (Paula laughs) - [Paula] Mmm - [Theresa] Oh my gosh.;['postres']
1ncaCd9Us8k.json;"- Hey y'all I'm in my old kitchen on Turner's Creek and those. that have followed me for years, y'all will recognize this kitchen because I shot in this kitchen for years. So, I'm back in it! Michael and I have come full circle, we're right back where. it started (laughs). We at the scene of the crime (laughs). - It's a good crime. - That's the wall that. my two dogs ran around and found Michael propped. on his chain link fence smokin' a cigarette and. talkin' on his cell phone. And you know what, 16 years later, the only thing he doesn't do any different is he aint smokin' cigarettes.. - Exactly. - It's cigars now. And they stink so bad. So, the team and myself, my team, Eddie. My team, Theresa. And my team, Paula. That's our team (laughs). And we got together and we. talked about Christmas cookies and we thought it would be fun to do the 12 days of Christmas cookies. Well, when we opened up. Paula Deen's Family Kitchen in Nashville Tennessee,. there was a cute young man that was our photographer and his name was Phillip Feldman, Fryman, F-r-y-m-a-n and he is really really. loyal to southern cooking and he has his own Facebook page and it's called, and. we'll send you the link so that you can go there and. find out more about Phillip, but it's Phillip. - Southern FATTY.. - Uh-huh. I think it's just Phillip,. not his second name, but just Phillip and southern and Southern FATTY. Now the FATTY is all. capital F-A-T-T-Y .com. So it's PhillipSouthernFATTY,. capitals, .com. So, Phillip, you did so good the day we were up there takin' pictures and the grand opening. and the ribbon cutting of that restaurant was so. so exciting for all of us and I appreciate. everything you did darling to capture it on paper. And not just, out there in the waves, in those computer waves. So I decided, after. Theresa spoke with you, you gave us permission to. use your favorite cookie that your mother makes every Christmas. (dogs barking) Whoa, who is it? (dogs barking) Hush! So I have had this cookie years ago, I'm almost thinking my grandma. Paul might have made it. But I don't know that I've ever made it. So Phillip, I'm thrilled to. death to get your recipe. And it's called cornflake cookies and it's an easy recipe,. prep time maybe 15 minutes. Cook time about 15 minutes. So this is really gonna go quick. So I can't wait to try you and. your mama's cornflake cookies And we're gonna start off by. beating two sticks of butter. Y'all aint shy about all the. butter and Crisco (laughs) used in this recipe. - [Theresa] That's. southern cooking though. - I know, it's southern cooking! And this is butter. flavored solid shortening. I think you know who makes it, they've been around for 100 years. So, we are just gonna beat these. All right, let's see, cream. butter, sugar and shortening until just, no until. well combined on this. So, I'm gonna beat this for a minute and then I'm gonna throw in our sugar. Theresa and I was just in a conversation. (dogs barking) Hush Lulu! We were just in a. conversation about whether you're supposed to use like frosted flakes or just plain cornflakes and Theresa said, I'm adding two cups of sugar, ya'll, and Theresa said well I. bought just plain old frosted, I mean plain old cornflakes. because frosted flakes has a whole bunch of sugar! And since we just put two. cups of sugar in here, Theresa felt like we. did not need any extra. - [Theresa] But what does Paula think? - What does Paula think? A little more sugar didn't. never hurt nothin' (laughs). - [Theresa] So you would. be using frosted flakes. - Except my belly, no Theresa, since I didn't see frosted anywhere, I'd a stood up there and I'd. have a debate with myself. But I would probably would have. just settled on what he said cornflakes.. - It's unusual for you Paula to follow a recipe.. - I know (laughs). I know it, ha-ha. So Phillip, you're just a dear and I'm so proud for the first recipe of 12 days of Christmas is yours! Okay, so that seems to be pretty good. All right, now let's see. what his next step is. He tells us to sift. together flour, baking soda. - [Theresa] On the left hand side. - Over here, cream of tartar, right here. And, okay, how much salt did he say? - [Theresa] Half a teaspoon, I believe. - Half a teaspoon, yes. So let's see what I. can transfer this with, I think I'll use this. So, this is all purpose flour. Plain flour or all purpose,. whatever you call it. I can't wait to taste this recipe and see if it rings the bell. All right, soda, tartar. And then half a teaspoon salt. You know, this sounds. like to me kinda like that potato chip cookie, Theresa. - [Theresa] Oh yeah. - Have you ever had the potato chip? - I have.. - Well my cousin Don, when he and Darleen come up. and spend Christmas with us, he makes that beautiful. cherry cookie every Christmas and we've done that for. years and years and years with Don and Darleen. - [Theresa] Is that the chocolate chunk? - No, it's the cherry cookies, with the icing on top. Oh my gosh, they are so good, and they look real Christmas-y. They good! So, and he also makes. that potato chip cookie which this reminds me of that cookie, yes. Come on flour, get through there. You know what I found. is the last ingredient to stay in the sifter? - The salt?. - Kosher salt. Stirring it up, put it. in there, all right. So let's see what little Phillip says. Did I leave, may I have. my measuring scoop please? Thank you! All right! So by hand, all right let's see, he said add this to the butter mixture and combine until just mixed. So that's what we're gonna do. He doesn't say to add it in small amounts, he just says add it to our butter mixture. I think I'll do it like two separate, two separate batches. Okay, this is gonna be very thick. A thick batter. All right, here we go. You know, every time I hear, ""there we go"" I think of that children's nursery rhyme. ♪ There we go round the mulberry bush ♪ ♪ The mulberry bush ♪ I'm trying to think, because. of the little triplets, they love for you to sing. And I've been workin' on. my nursery rhyme songs. Here we go! ♪ Here we go round the mulberry bush ♪ and oh my goodness, they. love ""London Bridge"" They love that one. - [Theresa] I'm thinking. what we get you at Christmas this year a CD of nursery rhymes. - Yes!. - And then that way you can practice.. - I would love that. But where would I play this? Where would I play that CD? - [Theresa] Maybe I'll. get it for you via iTunes this way you can put it on your iPad. - Oh okay.. - Play on your iPad. - Do we have a CD player, Eddie? - [Eddie] I don't think so. - I don't think I got one of those. - [Theresa] Isn't that sad? That's how far we've come along. that CD players are obsolete - They are?. - No, not really. They still have them in cars, I think! - Yeah.. - Half the people have them - Yeah I think I've got one in my car, but I have never, and Lord have mercy, what have I had that car, eight years? I have never figured out. how to put a CD in it. - [Theresa] You have. Sirius, don't you on your? - Yeah, yeah.. - They probably have a nursery rhyme channel,. they have everything. - If I was not computer illiterate, that would be a grand idea. - [Theresa] I have a feeling. Eddie can figure it out. - All right, let's see. I need a spatuler. And Phillip says to just. beat this until mixed. All right, we're gonna. try to sling some of that batter off without. slinging it all over us. Did I get you, Eddie?. - No (Paula laughing) - Look it went way out there. - [Eddie] This is a nice, deep counter. - Uh-huh, Eddie. But it about got you, it was close. All right, so Phillip tells. us to add the vanilla. - [Theresa] Two teaspoons. - Two teaspoons?. - Yes ma'am. - Thank you, 'cause. I've already forgotten. So Theresa, Theresas had a sick baby, her baby is sick and it's one. of those four legged babies. (laughs) And do you have your dog home? I meant to ask you. - [Theresa] I do, I bought him home. He has a little slipped. disk, bless his little heart. - A slipped disk and he's half, he's part. - I don't know.. - He's a dachshund. - He was a rescue.. - A rescue. - [Theresa] And he's got a little bit of, they told me King Charles. Cavalier and Chihuahua. But he looks like Eddie, would we say a Jack Russel with Beagle. - [Eddie] Yeah, I was gonna say beagle. - He's got a long body.. - And little fat legs. - And little fat legs and somehow that little long body has worn him out. - [Theresa] It is a good. think I don't have children 'cause I have driven. people nuts about this dog. - So Phillip tells us to add in the pecans and the cornflakes by hand, and so I'm gonna get those mixed up and then we're gonna mound. 'em up on cookie sheet that's lined with parchment paper and we're gonna bake 'em at. 350 for about 13 minutes. Okay! Here we go, Phillip! Oh my goodness! I had two smaller pans. and then this large pan and (laughs) Phillip,. you said in your notes, that this was the best. cookie in the whole world and this is what you. wanted your mother to make every Christmas, well I'll tell you what, old Paula Deens jumpin' on. that same bandwagon with ya. 'Cause I tasted, you see. there's a cookie missing off this plate right here. I had to already taste one and. they are out of this world. And guess who showed up, look over there. Guess who showed up just in time? Michael Gruva can smell a. cookie baking five miles away. (laughs) Can't ya Mike? Can't he, Henry? (laughs) Papa just. loves him a good cookie. What do you think about it, Henry? - [Henry] It's good. - Mmm, isn't it good? Mmm, you hadn't tasted. it yet, had you Michael? - No, I'm waitin'. - You want? Mmm! I will definitely be making these again.";['postres']
1uzuOmwi2Lo.json;"- Hey y'all, I'm in the kitchen. I have the pleasure of. being here in the kitchen with my cousin, Don Hires. With the exception of COVID, it's like Christmas and. Thanksgiving didn't happen. - That's right. - Because we were kinda home-bound, but y'all have spent. every Christmas with us, you and Darlene, for how many years? - 12, 15, something like that. - Yeah something like that. - I mean a lot. It's crazy. - Every Christmas. Well guess what? They're not spending Christmas with us this year cause they're going to New Jersey and dogsit. - And having a ball! (both laughing) Yeah. - Picking up dog turds. (both laughing) And cleaning up pee pee spots. - Oh yeah.. - So y'all will have a ball. So, every Christmas as. soon as Don and Darlene walk in the door I said. ""Okay, ready to make your Cherry Christmas Cookies?"" He makes them every year. Well last year we shot a YouTube. - Uh huh. - Of the twelve days of Christmas cookies. - Yeah, yeah. - And we made a cherry cookie but is wasn't the same thing Don. So, this Christmas we. are making the real deal, Christmas cookie that you make every year. So go. - Batches and batches and batches. - Go. - Okay well this ain't, (both laughing) - It's really pretty simple, the hardest part is just the setup. - Yeah. - Because, well you can see here. - And Heidi did that for you. - Well, I tell you what- (lady laughing) this is going to be the best. year for making these cookies. - I know! - What we have here, we have, I think it's about a half a cup. - Cup, a cup of sugar. - A cup of sugar, a half a cup of Crisco. - Yes and we're using the butter flavored. - Butter flavored. - Solid shortening. - Yes, that's right. And then a half a cup of. Maraschino cherry juice. - Yeah. - And the trick here is, I don't know that you can buy Maraschino cherry juice. - You can, I've bought it before. - Oh, you have? - But why, because you need- - We're gonna need the cherries? - Yeah you need the cherries. - So just buy a combat sized. jar of Maraschino cherries - Okay - And separate the cherries. and you have the juice. (beater whirring) - That's what I recommend too, so, okay, I've got your solid shortening. with your cup of sugar. - That's right. - And, do you want to add - I like- - Do I need to cream this a little better? - I think it needs to be. creamed a little better. - Okay. - And then just, you do. this like you do a lot of baking you add a little and. add a little until you're - Well the only thing. is baking is so precise. - It's chemistry. - It darn sure is, it's all about science. Okay Don - All right here we go. - Just slowly okay? So I won't splash it all over us. - Well we gotta add an egg, one egg - Okay. - And then we add a,. about a half a teaspoon of salt Paula. - Okay. - And a couple of. teaspoons of baking powder. - Okay. It is powder now not soda? - It's not soda no, no no no. - Okay, why don't we add. this powder to the flour. (phone rings) - I think so, you're gonna - And I'll give you - A whisk.. - A whisk. - And then we mix it all together. - Yeah. - There you go. - So I'm going to go ahead and beat this egg in it while you're - Please! - Okay so, we've got the. prep done over on this side, now we need to add the cherries, the nuts and the flour, but I. think we'll start with - I would recommend the flour first. - Flour first, yes. - And then fold this in. with a spatula or something. - Yes that's right. - [Davey] And the almond. - And the almond. - I'm going to go ahead and add the almond - About a half a teaspoon. - Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. - All right, well, there you go. One little cuppy, cap. - [Davey] I think it. called for a full teaspoon. - Interesting - [Mikey] You might want to. keep some of that recipe. - [Davey] Is it half teaspoon? - Yeah. Yeah. - Don you might want to. keep some of that recipe a secret because once. Paula finds out you may not but you know. (both laughing) - Well there is that. - [Mikey] You may not. get another invitation. - Yeah, well. - Oh don't tell him that Mikey. - Oh stop making my. day, stop making my day. - Cause listen, I love it. when he comes in and takes some of the pressure off. our hands. I love it. - And we have a good. time cooking together. - Yes we do have a good time. - Not just making deserts, and cookies, but the prep we do on. Christmas morning together - Yeah. - When everybody else is in bed. - Yeah. (beater whirring) - It's like a, the most. powerful little hand mixer. - It is, well it's a good brand too so. - Do you want me to dump. the rest of your flour in? - Yeah, yeah, let me use this a little bit. There we go. - Yeah, so, lefty. - That's me, that's me. Are there any other lefties in our family? - My Daddy was a lefty. - Well there you go. - And, Don and I are first cousins, his father, and my father were brothers - That's right, that's right. - My father lived a very. lived a very short life. Uncle Bernie enjoyed a fairly long life. - He did. - How old was uncle Bernie when he passed? - He was 76. - You know, for the life he lived - He beat the odds, because health and him was not exactly close friends. - No, I mean he smoked. them cigarettes like there was no tomorrow. - Well there weren't going. to make them anymore. - And liquor drinks. - Yeah he enjoyed it. - And liquor drinks to. go with those cigarettes he lived life large. - He did. He did. And he enjoyed it. - He did. He did. - Whereas, and it's funny about Uncle Earl being left handed,. everybody said when I was young, that I resembled. him more than anyone else in the family. - Really?. - Yeah And grandma always said that. - Really? - Yeah. - Our little angel Grandmamma. - Yeah she said ""Donny, you look just like Earl Wayne."" (Paula laughs) And your Daddy, all the. kids loved your Daddy, as you're well aware. - Yes - He gave his time, he. acted like he was really interested in the children. - And my Daddy he loved to laugh. - He loved it and your laugh. is just like his laugh. - Oh, you think so? - Oh, Paula no question. Okay I think we've got this just about - I think we do too so. now we're just going to fold in the cherries and the nuts. You want me to chop these. nuts a little bit finer? - What do you think? - Well lets lift that up.. - Yeah. - If you would just pass me a knife. Not that little one. - No, no let's use this one,. because you can rock it. - Okay. - There you go. And I like the way you. do that, I think it's important that when you. are using sharp instruments that you use them correctly. You rock the knife and sort. of push at the same time. - Yes, you want to be careful. - So you and me going to. put in these cherries? - Yeah, I'm right behind. you with your nuts. - I know you are. Nuts for nuts. Okay. And this is, probably. the most strenuous part is folding these in. - Uh huh. You know what? This poor guy, and I really do feel bad about it now, but I would almost drive him crazy, (both laughing) because I was a big. teaser, but now I just like to play jokes on folks (chuckles) and he was the lucky recipient. (Paula laughing) - Lucky me. - That's why he's screwed up in the head. (Paula laughing) - Thank you for that little shock too. - Uh huh, watch your sore groin. Is your groin growing? - My groin, yeah. - All right, here's. something I forgot to do that's so very important. - Yeah, spray it - I forgot to spray it, so. - There you go. - Here we go. - You like that or you want the powder? - No. - Okay, how about flour? - I was going to say. I don't know what kind of powder you are talking about. So, is this about the size you make? - Yeah I think so, and I. usually do four or five times six or seven, so. I can get, you know, two or three dozens a pan. - All right, I'm going to. turn it over to you now since it's your cookies. Now do these spread much? Can we get four? - We can get four. - Okay, well I'm going to slide them. - Yeah you can get four. - Over a little bit. - Okay - Okay, you may have. to keep spraying that. - Yeah I'm afraid so. - I mean I can get a. spoon and help you, but you know it's very important y'all, when you're making your cookies, that they're all the same size because if they're different sizes - They cook differently and. - Yes, yes. - You have some that are overcooked and, - Some that are raw. - Mhmm. - All right let's see if. we can share this bowl Don. - I think so because its. going to take forever. - If you'll take your cookie. sheet and sit down there. - Yeah. - And then we can share the bowl. - Okay good. - How's that? - Works perfect. - Okay Don. - Well as you can see, these. are prettier than yours. - No they're not! (both laughing) You are wrong sucker! - These are, yours are. pretty, mine are uniform. - Yes. But mine are uniform. - Well, yeah they are. So what do we do now? - We gon' put them in the oven. - All two? Okay we'll do that.. - Yes, all two. - So let's go. And two cookies sheets. used up all the dough so that's perfect. What you saying Mikey? - [Mikey] Nothing. - And we're going to bake these, for eight to nine minutes. - [Davey] At? - 350. All right so Don? - Yes ma'am? - You've got to make your frosting. - Lucky me! Let's do it. - He's a lucky guy! - That's it. - All right I'm going to. kind of clean up this mess - Okay. - And I can't remember if. you used the mixer with your, - Well you almost have to. - Okay, well I'm going to wash these and get these back to you. - Okay, this, this frosting you can use, you know, a store bought. frosting if you want to. I like to use this. because it's not as thick, and when it sets it's a nice finish to it. - Yes - So, what we have is. a teaspoon of Crisco. - A solid shortening. - Yes, yes. Solid shortening. - I don't know why you'd. go through the trouble of making this wonderful. cookie, and then use a canned frosting with it. I just wouldn't do it. - I don't understand that. - If I was going to do. it, I'd do it right. - Do it right. Do it right or don't do it. - Yeah. Okay let me. make sure that these are in the right spot for you,. because it makes a difference. - It does, and making the recipe, the tricky part is ensuring that the confectioners. sugar stays in the bowl, so you have to use a low speed at first, to get underway. - A teaspoons not very much. - No. No. - So here you go. That's a teaspoon. - There we go. - In my guestimation. - Well it's close. - Do you need here let me reach in here. and get you some scissors. - Okay, and it says three. quarters of a pound, but we don't have a- - Three quarters of a pound would be about two and a half cups.. - Okay. that's a pound.. - Okay And this is a two pound bag. - Yeah. - So I would say, - What are you gonna use? Okay. - Yeah. All right, there's two,. so there's like three and a half cups to a pound of sugar so use three quarters of a pound. - I think that's about right. - Is that what the recipe calls for? - Yeah three quarters of a pound. - Okay. So I'm going to use. about two and a half cups. - That'll be perfect. - And we can always add more. - Sure. Sure. And we are going to need a dash of milk. - Okay. Well you can start with the frosting and I'll get your stuff. anything that you need - All right. So set this on low, when you start. (beater whirs) - I'm going to go ahead. and add your almond. - Almond?. - Yes. - I'm going to use this because that top. That top has a little something-something in it to keep it fresh. - Yeah , yeah. - All right. So it calls. for a half teaspoon. - We're going to use a dash of milk and I think everybody. will be surprised at how that helps this liquefy. - I've just pulled out. half and half y'all. And you got to have some. red food coloring right? - Mhmm. - Okeydokey. Oh here it is we already had it out. - Good. - I like this gel. - I haven't used it. - It's a little bit more intense. - Mhmm, I can smell it, it smells good. There we go. - Yeah it's going to. take more than a dash. - Yeah it sure is. But it's starting to come together. - Mhmm. - I think we'll need another little dash. - Oh yeah, yeah. But when you see it. starting to take shape, a little liquid will go a very long way. - Yes, yeah. - With your confectioners sugar y'all, so, you'll want to be a little aware. So you tell me when it's. about the consistency that- - Okay, it's starting to get that- - You may want to turn that, okay you're just on one. that thing is powerful, how does that look? - I think its starting to look good. - I think so too. - You see how it's kinda creamy there? - Yeah. - I mean, do we need to. add more powdered sugar? - I don't know. - I don't remember. - What you do is that you don't cover that. cookie completely because it's going to spread a little. - Unless you're Paula or Michael Drew. - Unless you're Paula or Michael Drew. - Then Mike wanna come. back for a double dip. - Yeah. This is a good start. (inaudible) - We can always add to. it to get it all thicker. - We can, we can - But if you did want it,. I know that you used to that it was thin enough for it to - Yeah that's just about. the right consistency. I think, I think. - Kind of roll down your cookie. - Sure. - And what are we doing with these? - Those go on top of the. cookie after you ice it. - Okay, are we going. to use the whole cherry or cut them in half?. - What we can do, we've got a few minutes. before the cookies are done, I'm thinking cut them in half. - Okay. You can get you a knife,. maybe one of that little nice. - Yeah, I think so. - Cause that cherry ain't very big. - No. And I personally think. this makes the cookie. Myself. - Oh mine are so much prettier than yours. - I doubt that very. seriously, but we will see. We'll see what the comments are too. - Okay I believe I'll have a bite. Who wants a bite? Who wants a bite? - You want a bite. - All right now we have. to let these cool y'all and then we'll ice them. But piggy Paula, couldn't. wait that long so I just frosted one, hot. - Tell me if it's bad or good. - It's everything I remember Don. (Don chuckles) Cause the only time we had. these are at Christmas. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know there are people. they just, they like them. - We like them. Does anybody else want to taste? - I do. - Okay. (Don laughing) Would the film-maker like a little taste? - Just a little taste, thank you. - I can't tempt Davey, he. is on his special diet. He doesn't vary. - Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take one of these, and look at that. - Now I'm going to have. to eat another one, cause I ain't have the. cherry on top of mine. Right? - Oh Paula. See it's dripping, but, it'll harden up. But it's not going to be. around long enough to harden up because it's basically. going between my lips. - There you go. Okay now remembered my. half of cherry, that time. - These are crispy. - Mhmm. - These are crispier than I remember, and they're good. - That's that wonderful. restaurant commercial oven. - It is. - So good Don. - That is good. - It's worth having you. around just to make these (both laughing) It's worth having your. aggravating butt around. - There you go. - I love you Cause. - I love you.";['postres']
23tkS1FBAH4.json;well we've gotten our turkeys taken care of they're all settled and waiting to be cooked but before we get started with those I'm gonna go ahead and start on our dessert which is called gooey butter cake and you're gonna love this recipe it's so easy and simple to make and once you taste it you'll never ever want pumpkin pie again we're going to simply start with a yellow cake mix and you can just use the brand of your choice along with one stick of melted butter and to that we're going to add one egg now you can't hardly get much simpler than that and this is going to be our crust we're gonna just beat this until all the cake is mixed and moist all right we're ready now so we're gonna just ease that up and kind of spin that off of our beaters as you can see our crust to our gooey butter cake is very very thick that's why I normally just stick it in a mixer and get done with it now all we're gonna do at this point is take our crust and lay it into our greased prepared pan and to make the spreading of my face a little easier I'm just gonna rub my hands in the pot that I had the butter in and I'm just gonna grease them up a little bit you know when I started making these wonderful little gooeys I just used a very basic recipe of cake mix and eggs and cream cheese but after a while I got bored making them that way so I got into the kitchen and I just played around and tested and I bet you at this point we probably make 50 different gooey butter cakes now we're gonna move to our cream cheese filling and I'm not even gonna bother washing this mixer we can use it just like it is you can make your gooeys the morning or the day before I really prefer a fresh gooey that was just out of the oven the day of Thanksgiving and you don't even have to refrigerate these which is even nicer we're going to start with our cream cheese and our powdered sugar and we're just gonna beat these two things together until they're fluffy really is so simple and then we're going to slowly add another stick of butter and remember this is called gooey butter cake so we're going to add three eggs to the center we're gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring getting there at this point now we are at our original gooey butter cake recipe now is when we're going to make our changes today because it's Thanksgiving we're going to make pumpkin and I'm using just a regular canned pumpkin and we're going to just fold this into our cream cheese and because this doesn't have any of your flavorings I'm gonna add a little ground cinnamon and a little nutmeg now I go lighter on the nutmeg than I do the cinnamon because it's really a potent seasoning and so at this point this is when you change your flavorings if you wanted to do blueberry or if you wanted to do peanut butter if you wanted to do cherry peaches whatever you want to do but as I told you this pumpkin is just perfect for Thanksgiving and look how wonderful see you getting your pumpkin e color now so all we do now at this point is pour it onto our crust in about 45 minutes we're gonna have the most wonderful pumpkin dessert you've ever put in your mouth and we're ready to go into the oven our cooking time is up now and our gooey butter cakes and they should be ready and they are they look just perfect now normally I would let these cool for about 20 or 30 minutes but I can't stand it I'm gonna go ahead and cut them now cuz I want y'all to see them I'm gonna just slice this and I love to eat and I can't eat a real big piece so cut them to suit your preference and these down here a little bit bigger so we'll give this into the men and I tell y'all before I put them on the platter I don't think anybody all know if I just sneak one real quick light so I've just got to taste it because it's been a while since I've had the pumpkin but look look look at that beautiful beautiful warm gooey pumpkin and I always top mine with a little fresh sweetened whipped cream and if you like when you go to serve it you can also just sprinkle it with a little cinnamon just dust your plate I don't think anybody all notice if one little tiny piece is missing it really is Thanksgiving;['postres']
25tymEcxLoY.json;- Hey, y'all, I'm back to Paula's quarantine cooking. shows, but you know what? I think we're going to. have to find another name for the show because I truly feel like we're on the tail. end of our quarantine. Hopefully very soon our. problems are going to be over with, but I'm not gonna. stop my cooking shows because I have loved. reconnecting with y'all again. And I get so many cards, so many letters so many recipes, and I love. each and every one of y'all. And I love the fact. that we are conversing. So let's think of a new name. Okay. Y'all help me, help me. So I am going to start off. I'm going to get this started,. and then we're going to talk. You want to talk, Theresa? - [Theresa] Let's talk.. - We're all talk. Alright, now where's my other sheet. I had another sheet. I don't know what I did with it - [Theresa] This one, but it's the same. - Oh, it's the same thing. - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - That may be a little. easier for me to read. I'm going to make a. chocolate chess pie today. And this recipe and request was sent in from Stacy Thompson. And this, this pie was. served at the Angus Barn in Raleigh, North Carolina,. and Stacy loves this pie. So she was gracious, gracious. enough to send me the recipe and she's tweaked it a little bit. So I'm going to make it. just like Stacy does. And like I said, I so. appreciate y'all's recipes. I just like, I like hearing. what, what y'all like out there and what y'all are doing. So I'm going to put a stick and a half of butter in a double ball or whatever. Thank you. Whatever kind of pot you're using. And that's like I said,. that's over boiling water. And so we go melt our butter. Our, let's see, how much Theresa. I can't even remember. An ounce and a half of unsweetened Baker's chocolate. And then Stacy said that she. added this to the recipe. A handful of Ghirardelli's. unsweetened chocolate. I think bittersweet,. bittersweet chocolate. She said, cause she just wanted a little. bit richer than what it was. So we got richer. Alright. So. We just gonna let that melt, and all I have to do is. just stir it occasionally. We'll turn that down a little bit. Cause you know, we're going to talk. What was in that? Oh the chocolate. I've already put that in there. Y'all. (chuckling) Look at me, I done put on my makeup today. - [Theresa] You look so pretty. - Oh, well thank you. - [Theresa] I told you to. tell them how pretty you are. - I ain't telling them how pretty I am. Cause I don't think I'm all that pretty, but I tell you what. Powder and paint makes us what we ain't. I'm addicted to powder and paint. So anyway, how many months now? Have, when did life stop for us? March?. - [Theresa] March, March 17th. - March, April, March 17th?. - [Theresa] 'Case we had no St. Patrick's Day. - That's exactly right. They cancel St. Patrick's day. And you know, Savannah has the second. largest celebration of St. Patrick's day in the United States. Second only behind New York city. And I think they cancel. theirs too, didn't they? Yeah. So hopefully we're getting back to normal, but that's March, April, May, June, July, August,. September, seven months. - [Theresa] Tell them. how your eye's doing. - Yes.. - [Theresa] Because remember, you've been off a little bit for that too. - That's what I'm getting. to, you know, we've been in quarantine for seven months,. almost eight months, right? Eddie.. - [Eddie] Yes. - And so when we were. quarantined, I started thinking about, you know, what can I do to just have the ability to pop. in to people's phones or iPads or computers and just. cheer them up a little bit. And so Bobby said, mama,. please, please do a cooking show on YouTube. So I asked Gabby, I. said, why am I not doing? And he said, I don't know. Nobody knew why I wasn't doing it. We hadn't thought of it. So I started doing it. And you saw me in a much more casual... - [Eddie] Atmosphere.. - In my real way, in my real self, you. know, in my atmosphere. So last night I had a two hour show with JTV and JTV is jewelry television. And I have a line of. jewelry that I come on with. And so it just got me. all hyped up last night. What is Emily's last name? I can't remember. - [Eddie] Peterson.. - [Paula] Pierce that's right. Emily Pierce.. - [Eddie] No, Peterson. - Peterson, Emily Peterson. One of the most wonderful sweet girls you could ever. hope to meet does my hair and makeup and nobody. can do it like Emily. Well Emily came in yesterday. and did my hair and makeup. And I did my show on. JTV and it was so nice. Cause every day I get up. and I look in the mirror and I say, oh, Paula, you. just got to be butt ugly the rest of your life. That's just the way it goes. You got a bum eye that you're not supposed. to be putting makeup on. So 73 and just butt ugly for life. Well, last night, Emily just fixed me up and I just almost felt pretty again. So I tried to duplicate it today. Course it's nothing like. Emily does, but you know what? I'm just, I'm just forewarning y'all. Some days you're going to see me looking like I just crawled out of bed and some days you're going to. see me where I tried to gussy up for you. But my hope is that you. enjoy these enough to put up with me being butt ugly. straight out of bed day. Right?. - [Theresa] That's it. - Because I've just got no. intention to leave y'all. Nobody can make me leave except y'all. So, ooh, look. Look, look, look. You know, now a chess pie, y'all. I've always thought of. a chess pie you know, having meal, corn meal,. mama used to make them. And she, I think she would. just sprinkle it on the top but you know, this, this recipe. does not call for any meal. Nope, no meal. So I guess chess pie recipes come in all different shapes and sizes. So I'm going to stop right here. and let this finish melting and we'll come back to. that after it's melted. So good to be back. But I want to tell y'all I do appreciate my sons taking full responsibility. of this stove while I was out with my eye. And, but you know, we're. a team, the three of us, we're a team. So you'll be seeing them right on. Okay gang we're back here, back on our chocolate chess pie that. Stacy Thompson sent me. And it's such an easy, easy pie. Course chess pies are easy anyway. And the only difference in a. regular chess and a chocolate is you just have to melt your chocolate. So, and I am using a. store bought pie crust. And you know, it, this. just works well in my life. It cuts a lot. (dog toy squeaking) of time out and one of the dogs. had found their noisy toys. So if you hear a lot of squeaking, it's not Theresa down there crying. (laughing) Listen, Max is... - [Theresa] Give me that toy! - Max is crazy. When he gets a toy. y'all he won't share it. - [Eddie] He's already back around. (laughing) - Hey Max, hey buddy. And listen. When the other dogs have a toy, like when my children's dogs come over and they may have a toy with. them, Max will get their toy. He'll run, take it off.. And then he'll pee on it. And then he keeps it like, no, you're not getting. my toy back. This is my toy. Gimme that toy, Max.. - [Eddie] Max has issues. - Gimme that toy, Max. Gimme that toy, gimme that toy. Gimme that toy. Gimme that toy.. (laughing) Oh my gosh. They have a lot of fun. Okay back to our pie.. (dog toys squeaking) So I have three eggs that are unbeaten and I am just gonna, and Stacy says to just use the hand mixer on this recipe and, and in goes her sugar. And remember it calls for one and a fourth cup of sugar, I. think in the original recipe. But Stacy took hers down to one cup. So I'm doing this just like Stacy. So remember if this pie to your. tongue is not sweet enough, you're safe to go ahead. and add a fourth of a cup more of sugar. - [Eddie] She added that extra chocolate. Maybe that took care of it. - She added the extra chocolate. Yes. So she felt like she. had to take away something. Alrighty. Let's see. Next goes our carob syrup. How much is that supposed to be? Quarter of a cup. - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - Okay, I was thinking I had. seen three quarters of a cup and I'll give y'all a. little tip right here. We didn't do it, but it sure does help. If you'll spray your measuring cups with a nonstick spray before. you, before you put honey or syrup or anything. like that, it's sticky. It'll just cause it and flow right out. - [Theresa] See, you needed to a good tip. - Yes. - [Theresa] I was helping you out. - All right. (mixer whirring) Okay. So this is cooled down enough that we don't have to worry. about tempering our eggs. So in goes a melted. chocolate and our butter. And this is smelling wonderful. - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. - [Paula] Doesn't it smell good, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - Yum yum, whoa. Get every drop out. And then I think it calls. for like a half a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. I'm trying to put a teaspoon 'cause I like vanilla flavoring. And the recipe Stacy tells us to put this in a preheated oven,. preheated to 375 degrees. But now, you know your oven. better than we know it. So use your own judgment on whether you want to stay at 350 or 375. I'm actually starting this one out at 350, - [Theresa] But you're gonna be-- - Yeah, but I've also flipped. this oven to convection so that will make up. So that is it, I spend. a lot of time talking. If I hadn't have been talking we could have made this. pie in like two minutes. Really. This reminds me a little bit of our chocolate, gooey butter cakes. The way it smells. - [Theresa] This has got Eddie's. name written all over it. - [Paula] All over it.. - [Eddie] It does, doesn't it. - [Theresa] I almost, I told. him I almost had to make two. And he was like, well,. there's never enough chess pie in the house.. - [Paula] Uh uh, uh uh. - [Theresa] I think he's. a little disappointed that we only got the one. - Between Eddie and Michael and me. (phone ringing) Excuse me. Let me look at the phone. It may be, it is, hello? - [Man On Speaker] Yes (indistinct) - Thank you. (beeping). (dogs barking) Okay. Excuse me y'all. - [Theresa] I was going to say. you don't ever leave anything in the bowl. - I'm trying to get it all y'all. I want us to have every bite. - [Theresa] Eddie was hoping you were going to leave a little bit. for him to lick a spoon. - [Paula] Oh he was? Oh okay, then maybe I won't get. that little bit right there. Maybe I'll just leave it. Okay there, Eddie. - [Eddie] She ain't kidding. - [Theresa] I'm not kidding.. (laughing) - No honey.. (dog barking) What? Do we have company? Do we have company? Alright. Stacy also says she. recommends cooking it on a on a baking sheet. So it just makes it easier. when you go to get it out of the oven. And I totally agree with her. I dripped a little chocolate on the crust. But I think it's okay.. (dogs barking) So she tells us to bake it. uncovered for 30 minutes. Oh my gosh. Theresa turned on the oven,. but she didn't put it to temp. So I don't know. I maybe should take it out. Yeah. I thought Theresa turned it. - [Theresa] I did turn it on, didn't I? - It wasn't on, it was on 200. - [Eddie] Is this oven on? No?. - No. This one was turned on,. but it was just turned on at 200 degrees, you. know, where (laughing). - [Theresa] Your markings. are a little funny on that. - That is oh.... - [Theresa] Fancy oven. - That is okay, Theresa. - [Theresa] We fixed it? - Yes. That is an easy fix. If that's the worst thing. that goes wrong today we are doing good sister. - [Eddie] It just means chocolate pie ten minutes later. - Yes. And Stacy said it's fabulous. with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and a little. chocolate drizzle over it. - [Theresa] Well, we'll. be back to show 'em. - Yes, we will. And I came out with a. hand sanitizer y'all. I take it on to Shop HQ and I enjoy, enjoying using. it in the kitchen rather than having to walk off and. wash my hands every few seconds. This way, I feel like I'm, I'm clean. (dishes clinking). (dog toy squeaking) Just makes me feel better. I got to stay clean for. all these grandchildren that we've got. So that's it. We're going to bake it for 30 minutes. And then Stacy said every. five minutes, look at it and determine. She said it needs to jiggle. just a little, which sounds like our gooey butter cakes. We want to jiggle just a. little bit, but not much. So Eddie, you'll be eating. pie in 30 minutes baby, or maybe 35 or maybe 40. Okay. Y'all. Stacy Thompson's chocolate. chess pie is ready. Hopefully it's cool enough for me to cut. And you know, I told John that we used a frozen pie crust, so, oh my gosh. And she said, leave it a little jiggly. You know, when you take it out. of the oven and I have shared with y'all how I get that first. piece of pie out of the pan. You know, it's, if you're. gonna mess up one piece and be able to get to the rest of the pie. Well, I take my scissors and I snip. Oh, there went the crust. I snip where I have indicated. where my piece of pie what size my piece of pie is going to be. And then you just want to take that down, pull that down. And it makes it so much easier. to get that first piece out. Oh, I didn't get all that. I left some I didn't mean to. There you go. I'm not, I'm not missing any of it. Wow. Oh gosh. My glasses won't stay up on my nose. I'm starting to sweat. Gosh, I wish I could give you. chocolate baby, but I can't. I just can't. It's not good for you. Pie and ice cream. Many, many pies scream for ice cream. Or fresh whipped cream. Now, I've got ice cream but I don't have any fresh whipped cream. So I'm going to cheat. I think this was bought for my grandchildren. when they were over here you know, and going to make something. So, and I am so hungry. Stacy girl. That is some more ever good. Stacy Thompson's chocolate chess pie. - [Eddie] The handful of extra chocolate makes the difference. - Yes, but you know what? Stacy cut the sugar by a fourth of a cup. - [Theresa] You would've kept it. - I would've kept it. (laughing) Because chocolate is really not sweet. It's bitter. So if y'all make it every. tongue's different though. Look at this. You know, when I was on that Food Channel they tried to teach me. how to take princess bites but I didn't know how I've never been a princess. So I didn't know what a princess bite was. Thank you, Stacy. Thank you so much for sharing that recipe. And I want to thank the Angus Barn in Raleigh, North Carolina,. for sharing this recipe with you so you could share it with us. So thank you darling. I appreciate it. And I'm sending everybody. love and our best dishes.;['postres']
2j_EWhia9jM.json;"- Happy Summer, y'all! This dish officially kicks off the Summer. June the 21st, is the first day of Summer. So, I'm gonna start with. a nice cold dessert. And, look what I'm gonna start with y'all. I'm gonna start with ice cream sandwiches, and it's called a frozen banana split. So, we are gonna put. our ice cream sandwiches in a 13x9x2 that we have. lined with tin foil. (Crinkling tin foil) And, once you pull these out, you kind of gotta work quick, because in this heat they. don't stay frozen very long. And, if your dish that. you're making it in, they don't fit well, just cut them to fit. I'm gonna cut this one to fit right there. And then, I'm gonna. cut this one like that, and just fill in the gaps. Theresa! - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Can you put this in the freezer, please? - Sure! - Back in the freezer,. until I can get to it again? - Certainly! - Mmm - I knew that was coming. - It needs cutting' (laughing) Mm! Mm mm mm So, I've got four bananas here and I tossed it in Fruit Fresh, because I don't like brown bananas. Now, I think the recipe. called for six bananas but I think the four is gonna do nicely. It'll put us a nice clean layer on top. Yeah, see that's covered every spec. Perfect! OK The next thing we're gonna do y'all is put a hot fudge sauce on it. Oh I don't know if I'm. gonna be able to y'all. I'm still having trouble with my shoulder but I got a shot this morning for it. But, my doctor had to come out here and actually go see. her mother who's aging. And so, she said, ""Rather. than you having to ride all the way out here to the landings,"" she said ""just let me run by,"" since she was going right by anyway. - [Theresa] That was nice. - Oh nice? It was wonderful, honey! All right, so we're using. a jar of hot fudge sauce that you'll find in your ice cream cone and ice cream department. Thanks Teresa, she heated. this for like 30 seconds in the microwave. - [Theresa] On defrost. - On defrost, okay. - Just so it doesn't melt. - Yeah, I mean, it's just. ever so slightly warm, which makes it so much. easier to get out (clanking). Okay, and you'll just. wanna spread that out. Now, the next thing that goes on is every banana split has. cherries on top, doesn't it? (clanking) So, I'm gonna rinse these off. - [Theresa] I already did. - Oh, you did rinse them? (water running) - Yes, ma'am. - Because, there's so much. dye in these cherries, that I don't want it to. turn my whole recipe, see? I don't want it to turn. my whole recipe pink. (water turns off) So I rinse them pretty good. (container knocking on cutting board) So we'll just give these a rough chop. These are pretty cherries! And we are gonna save half of those for the, for the last top. (container slides against counter) (knife slides out of block) (chopping) These would be good in the lid trick. The little lid trick, you know, to cut cherry tomatoes. - [Theresa] She always. tells me to leave her something to do so I decided to leave her the messiest job. (laughing) - That's all right! These cherry smell so wonderful. It's looking like a. banana split, isn't it? - [Theresa} Uh huh. - I think we need a few more. (container banging) I don't know if there's any. supposed to be left on top. I can't remember. - [Theresa] I don't think there is. I think they're all in there. - I don't there is, I think so too. (chopping) - So chop away! - Yes. Oh my goodness. I'm swallowing hard again. (laughing) Okay, now the next step ... Oh is chocolate toffee bits. Now you can get these just toffee bits or you can get them with chocolate and I love the chocolate ones. So we are going to use half of that because every banana split. has nuts on it, doesn't it? So here comes the nuts. (nuts being sprinkled on dessert) The kids are gonna love this. - [Theresa] Hmm - Okay. And the next to the last. thing we're gonna do now is a butter scotch ice cream top part. So we're just gonna drizzle that on top. - [Theresa] Are you about. ready for the ice cream bars? - Almost, give me just. one little more second. Cause they were, those bars. were getting very soft. Mm. Now you could always take this y'all and fancy it up by using. all homemade stuff. But you know, I think for the kids, they're not gonna care. whether you made up syrup or used a jarred syrup. (dish scraping) What y'all think? - [Theresa] I wouldn't know. - Uh-uh. Okay. Ice cream sandwiches? - Coming! - Make sure she gets them Eddie. You know, this is something I very rarely buy is ice cream sandwiches. Seems like my grandchildren prefer. Look now, that one called for another one. I'm gonna see ... Yeah. Perfect. Mmm mmm mmm Y'all welcome to that if you like. - [Theresa] Yeah. - I'm gonna have to break. down and wash my hands this go around. (water running) So you'll wanna, you'll wanna. let this get in a freezer for a good while. (scraping, container opening) Normally y'all, I never use. a frozen dessert topping. I always make my own cream. But I'm just gonna do the. frozen whipped topping (drawer opening, utensils clattering) that you can find at your grocery store. And you'll want it to thaw. This could have thawed a little bit more but I think it'll be all right. Cause you know, if you. try to stir frozen whipped topping, it'll collapse on you. - [Theresa] Ew. - Yeah. (giggling) So don't even try. (container scraping) - [Theresa] This looks amazing. - Doesn't it look delicious? And so simple! Your children would have. a wonderful time or your grandchildren helping you put. this little dish together. - [Theresa] I can see. three little ones trying, fighting over who was gonna do what. (laughing) (container scraping) - The other day was Gus's birthday. And I found Gus a puppy ... puppy pie. What was the name of it Eddie? Puppy cake or puppy pie? - (Eddie) Yeah. I'm not sure.. It was a little dog cake. (laughing) - It was a little doggy cake. And ... so the triplets were over. (laughing) And when ... Ollie saw that cake, Ollie has a cake fetish, she loves cakes! (laughing) - [Theresa] Girl after my own heart! - Uh huh uh huh And when I pulled out that cake and put that candle in the center of it and lit it so we could sing happy birthday to Gus, she started. hollering, ""I want cake, I want the cake. I want cake!"" And I said, ""baby, this. is, this is for doggies."" - [Theresa] I bet that went over well. - No, she didn't care! And before I knew it, she had. grabbed a piece of that cake, that dog cake and popped it in her mouth. I said, ""No Ollie, no, no, no, no, no!"" And so I decided, well, if. my grandchild was tasting it, I was gonna taste it too, to make sure she wouldn't keel over. - [Theresa] They're gonna die together. - It was, it was good! (laughing) - Well they make them all. from, I mean they're all, they're all good stuff. - Yeah. Well Cloud,. she looked on the label and it had all people. ingredients. (dish scraping) - [Eddie] Yeah, I guess I've. eaten a dog cookie before. - So it kind of tasted. like a banana nut bread or a spice cake. - [Theresa] Yum. Okay so ... - Okay so in the freezer this goes y'all. - And we'll be back. - Yes, we'll be back after it freezes. Our dessert is nice and frozen. And remember this is banana split dessert and this is what we are. kicking off summer with! So remember it's got the. ice cream sandwiches, hot fudge sauce ... - [Eddie] Caramel sauce. (knife cutting, tin foil crinkling) - Caramel sauce. All right. Let's see. Woo hoo hoo hoo! Cherries. Bananas. (knife clanking) I'm gonna need a little spoon. - [Eddie] This is better. than ice cream cake. - Huh? - I said, this is better. than ice cream cake. - Yes. You know sometimes I just. would love a banana split, but I, you know I don't wanna go to the, to the trouble of making it. Now that tin foil being in there, you just make sure, you. don't wanna eat any tin foil. Cause it'll set your hair. on fire from your fillings. (laughing) All right, so here we go. You probably need to let this, pull it out and let it sit out. a few minutes Eddie. (laughing) Happy Summer to us! Mm. The frozen bananas are delicious. Mm. Mm. If you've got sensitive teeth, be careful. (laughing) Be careful. Mm. See the cherries? And then it's topped. with a frozen topping and then topped with the chocolate covered ... What am I trying to say Eddie? - [Eddie] The whipped topping. - No. - Oh, oh, the Heath bar. - Yeah. The Heath bar,. chocolate covered Heath bar. And to me, this reminds me. of like a butter finger kinda you know, that's been crumbled up. So if y'all are expecting a crowd, this is a perfect dessert. to make because this is gonna feed a lot of. people, at least 15 people. - [Eddie] Yeah. - Maybe even 20. - You can make this way ahead of time. - Uh-huh, way ahead of time. And if you're going to. a pool party somewhere, this would be a great dessert. for the children to eat out by the pool or the. sprinkler, whatever. (laughing) Mmm. Delicious y'all. Happy Summer! Y'all stay safe and hopefully y'all will be able to get out and see some more of the country and travel and have a good time. Loving best dishes! Mmm";['postres']

So Q has a bakery in Albany and that's where I first met her. Bubbles, took me to her bakery. And I think I had this peanut butter bar and I think I like it.. - Yes, you loved them. Okay.. - Yes, yes. - So Q is gonna share her recipe with us and it's like so many of. recipes that I share with y'all, it's doable. - Yes. - It's easy. Good chance you got all. this in cabinet, right? - Yes, yes, yes. - So and, oh, you took. your air conditioner off. - I did. (laughing) - Q is like me. We're head sweaters. - Yes, yes. - So somebody sent me a air conditioner to go around your neck and I love it. So I got it out for Q. So you're welcome to put it on. - Okay. - You might just can't turn. it on cause of the sound. - Okay. Okay. (both laughing) And if I have a flash, I'll. have to borrow it from you. - Okay. We'll share it. How about that? We'll share it. - Okay, so get going, girl. - All right. So we are gonna do the peanut butter bars. Some people call 'em old school, Old Fashioned. Peanut Butter Bars. Are they either call 'em Nutty Buddy Bars. - Nutty Buddy, yeah, they. taste like a nutty buddy, don't they? - Yes, yes, yes they do. So the first thing we're gonna. do is take our ingredients. We have two cups of sugar. We have two cups of self-rising flour. We have two cups of oatmeal. We have two eggs and one. cup of creamy peanut butter, things that you can find in your cabinet all day long. - You're so good. I kind of forget to tell my ingredients. (laughing) - So we'll start with the oatmeal and we mix it all in the same bowl. - Love it. A one bowl. - Yes. - One bowl wonder. - Yes, one bowl wonder. Nice and quick. So there's no special way. We also do two cups of, we do two cups of, two sticks of butter. Two sticks of melted butter. That's it. That's it, Paula. - See, I told y'all she was my soul. (Q laughing) - So I'm getting it all in here. All right. - So who rode with you today from Albany? - I have my dear friend that. rode with me from Albany, little Shakka, Barney Pate.. - Shakkakan. ( all laughing) - So I'm so thankful that she was able to come with me today. - I know that you were. - Yes. - That's got to be the most boring drive. - It is, yes. Oh my gosh, it is. - You think you're never. gonna get off of 16. - I know it. And luckily that's what. she likes to drive. So guess what? She was a great help. - Oh, so you drove, Shakka? - And then my two stick. (audio drops) - Do you know that margarine, this is what I hear, margarine was first invented to use on automobiles and things like that. - Oh no, I did not. - On machinery. - Oh wow. - And they finally found a. way for us to consume it. So, you know, I said, ""God made the cow ""and the cow made the butter. and stick with the real thing."" - [Q] Yeah, stick with the real thing. - [Paula] Stick with he real thing. - [Q] I use a pure butter,. real butter on everything. - Absolutely - I do, so I'm just... - Some people like margarine, but I recommend that you stay away from it maybe. - I do too. So I'm folding this. - Yes, you are. - It's very simple. Very, very simple, very quick.. - And this doesn't need any spay? - [Q] No spray, we've got... - [Paula] Because of the butter? - [Q] Yes, the butter. We got lots of butter. - [Paula] All right, well. I'm gonna be your sous chef and your cleaner upper. - [Q] All right. So we gonna fold this in and then we are gonna get it ready to go. - That's what I meant to ask you. I'm gonna cut the oven on. What do you bake it on? - We bake it on 325. - 325. - Yes. - [Paula] Well, I'm gonna. get our oven to going. - Okay and now I've got it folded. I'll put it into the pan. Do not spray your pan with these. Do not. You will mess up the. entire recipe if you do. I've done it before, y'all. (laughing) - Cause I believe in. those sprays, you know? - Yes. - [Paula] I've had some disasters. - So I'm just spreading it evenly. And we're gonna pop it in the oven. - [Paula] Q, - [Q] Yes. - [Paula] In case people missed our video, our conversation video? - Um hm. - [Paula] Tell everybody. about your YouTube. - Oh yeah. You all can find me on... - [Paula] It's new thing. that she just started, y'all. - Yes, ""Mixing It Up With Ms. Q."" And it's a combination of recipes, great talk and inspirational conversations that I have with my audience. - [Paula] Kind of like therapy, isn't it? - It is, it really is. So you don't wanna miss it. I'm sure someone you. know, if not yourself, can use some of that great. information that I give. I also added resources. If you need a second chance, you've had some struggles with. getting on track with life, you can get some resources off my YouTube, ""Mixing It Up With Ms. Q."" I did a pink table and I. offered a lot of resources after at the end of the pink table. So go and watch us, on ""Mixing It Up With Ms. Q."". - Is that done in the bakery, Q? - Actually it is, it is, yes. So we're gonna put this in. the oven for 25 minutes. - [Paula] Okay. I got your oven heating. - Okay. - That looks like delicious. And you know what? I think this might be a healthy recipe. You think? - Peanut butter. - The oatmeal and the peanut butter.. - Yeah. The eggs.. - Well, most people, yes. - Most people that come and they say, ""What do you have healthy?"" And they say,. (Paula laughing) ""Oh, it has peanut butter and oatmeal. ""I'll try that."" (Paula laughing) We're not gonna talk about the chocolate that goes on top of it once it's done. - Oh, oh, oh chocolate. - Yeah. (laughing) - Yay. (both laughing) - All right. So we're gonna start with our chocolate. - Yes, while our oatmeal bars, peanut butter oatmeal bars are baking, Q is gonna make the. chocolate icing to go on 'em. - Yes, yes, yes. So we're gonna start with. like a half cup of milk, and we're gonna pour it in the saucer. We gotta turn it on first, don't we? - [Paula] Actually that's heavy cream. - Heavy cream, yes. I love heavy cream. So I would do heavy cream. opposed to regular milk. - [Paula] Yeah. - Okay. - Or half and half - Or half and half. You can do half and half. - Yes. - Yes you can. - But ain't nothing like that, y'all. - I call heavy cream my secret weapon. I just love it.. (Paula laughing) I just love it. So we got about three cups. of powdered sugar here and we gonna add it into the heavy cream. Just making us some good old fashioned, homemade chocolate icing. - [Paula] Yeah, so simple, isn't it? - Yes, very simple. - When does your butter come in? - The butter is coming up next after this, so we're gonna go ahead. and add some cocoa. - [Paula] Do you need a whisk? - Yes, I do. Thank you. We gonna add a stick of melted butter. - [Paula] Okay. I will get it melted for you. - All right. Gonna put that right. there for the time being. And we just going to whisk this up. - [Paula] How many employees. do you have in your bakery? - Right now, I have five. - That's good. And are you open six days a week? - I am actually open five days a week. I'm open on Tuesday through Saturday. - [Paula] That's wonderful. - Yes, and I absolutely love it. I'm in Albany, Georgia. And it's called Qs Cakes,. Done the Old Fashion Way. That's my complete name. Yes. - [Paula] I am so proud of you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I enjoy what I do. I love talking to the people. I've become an influencer in my community and I absolutely love what. God is doing in my life. Oh yeah, this is cooking up real good. - [Paula] You look so good. to have son 38 years old. - A daughter. A daughter 38, and a son 28. - [Paula] Has she made. you a grandmother yet? - Yes. Yes. Well actually my granddaughter. graduated from college. She graduated from high school this year. We sent her to college on Monday. - [Paula] No. - Yes. - [Paula] Where did she go to school? - She's at Fort Valley. - [Paula] That's a, yes,. that's a good school. - Yes, yes, yes. Oh, looking good. I'm just waiting on my butter and this is going to be amazing. - Okay, it's melted enough. I think it'll finish. melting in your chocolate. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - This is perfect. - It's an honor to be your sous chef. - Well, I thank you. I'm gonna add a little vanilla. - [Paula] That's good. old homemade vanilla. - I see. I want this y'all. Paula got everything. (Paula laughing) She's got everything, I'm telling y'all. - We made this almost. a year ago, didn't we? - Wow. Y'all gotta help me talk her into taking some of that to the bakery. I bet y'all will like that, huh? - Yes, and you know for it. to really be good though, Q, it needs to sit for a couple of months. That's the only thing.. - Really? Yes, you get. - Oh wow. the vanilla beans and. slice 'em and then scrape all the goody off of 'em. - Oh wow. I'm gonna add the rest of this. - With your vodka? - Oh yeah. - Bourbon. - Or Bourbon. - [Paula] Yes. That's the only thing. You can't wait until you're out. - [Q] Right, you gotta make it, yeah, because it has to sit. and marinate for so long. All right. So we're about finished. with our chocolate icing. It's looking really good. - Um, um, um. That is chocolate-ate. - Yes. At its absolute best. (Paula laugh) I love it. - All right. That you get it thin enough, so you just pour it. - Pour it. Yes, it's a pour. Yes.. - Okay. The good old fashioned grandma icing. - Yes, I was gonna say,. it's more like an icing than a frosting, right? - Yes. Yes it is. All right. So we've got our peanut. butter bars out of the oven. Just pay attention to the color. We don't want 'em that dark, 'cause we want keep the moistness in 'em and we gonna bring them over here, where Paula is, and we're just gonna pour the chocolate that has been made.. - I tested your chocolate to make sure it was good enough for you. (laughing) - So what'd you think? - I think it's good enough for you. You do think it's good enough? - Yes. - All right. all right. So we're gonna pour it on top and Paula's gonna spread while I pour. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Q] Yes. - [Paula] Oh my goodness, Q. - [Q] Yes. - Oh, I forgot it was so hot. Don't touch.. - It's straight outta the oven. (chuckling) - Yes, don't touch. - Mm, this is, like, yummy looking. You got some more?. - I'm gonna pour a little more. - May I take this? - Yes. By all means.. - Every drop. Yes. Get it. Perfect. - You know you can tell. I'm from the old school. I get every drop out. - Every drop that's me. They laugh at the bakery. (speaking over one another) cause they say, ""Ms. Q is gonna get you ""if you throw some of that away."" - I'm telling you what. - We want every drop - Every drop. And I'd watch the kitchen. staff like a hawk, to make sure they wasted nothing.. - Nothing. - [Q] That's it. That is it. - I told them one day, (chuckling) I used this as an example and I think it made it clear for 'em, you know, what I was saying, but I said, ""I want. y'all to think about this ""because this does have. something to do with y'all. ""All right, you think. about this container, ""this dish of dessert. ""And I want you to think. about it this way."" I'm gonna wait for you. to come back over here. - [Q] Okay. - 'Cause I think it's a great. way to get away the, okay. So you think about, I asked them to think. about this pan of desserts. All right, this third of it. - [Q] Don't touch it. (Paula chuckles) - [Paula] This third of it. pays for the ingredients. This third pays your salary. And this part is a profit. for the restaurant. And it's very important that you don't throw the. restaurants profit away. - That's good. - 'Cause you need all of that. - All of that to make one. Perfect. That's perfect. I like it. I like it. So I want you to taste it.. - They understood. - They understood. - Oh good. Very good.. - It was clearer to 'em when I could involve. - When you did like that. their paycheck. - Exactly. I do a lot of that at the. bakery with customer service. Just telling them how. important the customers are. If you you treat them good,. - They're everything. and you show great customer service, they'll keep coming back and. we can keep the doors open and then I can pay you more. The more the customers,. the more you can get paid, the more the company can make. - That's exactly right. - I always telling 'em,. let's just keep that in mind. - I'm telling you. I've been in some businesses. queue where you walk in and that person in that business acts like they are doing me a favor.. - Favor. What's up with that? - I don't know. It's horrible. - [Paula] Oh gosh. Look at this. I don't know how big you cut. these in the restaurant, but. - [Q] You just cut a little. small piece so you can taste it. I just want you to taste it. - [Paula] Well, I could. have gotten four out of that but we'll get, we'll get three. I hope it'll come out. with it being so hot. - If you get a strong enough spatula I know how to get it out.. - Yeah, that's what That middle one right there.. I'm looking for. - Well, this one, this one. is my grandmother's spatula. I've got one that's not quite as wide that my Aunt Peggy gave me but this was my grandmother's spatula in her restaurant at River. Bend when I was little. - Really? - Yes. - Wow. - And it's got the date on it. It's got USA 1945. Oh dear, that's sweet.. - Two years before I was born. Oh that's sweet. - Yes. I adore it. - Oh, this is it. - So let me get a little plate. - Get a little plate. - [Paula] And a couple little forks. - Yes, ma'am. - [Paula] Theresa, we are. so glad you came back. - [Theresa] Me too. - You were having a time. looking for some ingredients. weren't you? - [Theresa] I was, today. - I'm sorry. - [Theresa[ It's okay. It's not your fault. I should have read the directions right the first time. (Paula and Q laughing) - [Paula] So this is warm. Keep in mind. It'll cut much better after school. Whoa. - Trying to hold it together. - Yes. Like I said after it cools. - After it cools. - It'll be fine. But you know what? A nice warm bite of something sweet is pretty good. - Yes. - It's real, real hot. - (chuckling) You like it? - Um hm. You taste the peanut butter,. a homemade chocolate. - How did you put that. in your mouth, honey? It's hot. - Gotta blow. (laughing) - It's so good. (laughing) (blowing) Um, um. Um. (laughing) - It's really good. - It is so good. That oatmeal and the chocolate. - See, the chocolate is, yeah, is not too sweet. It's just right. - Uh huh. - It's like a peanut butter cookie, with some chocolate icing on it. So this is Q's first recipe that she's sharing with us and she's gonna be doing two more.

3c2Y84zVjjM.json;"- Hey friends, I've shared a. lot of Easter meals with y'all, but I have yet to share an Easter sweet; something a little bit sweet for dessert. And this is one that you. can call your children into the kitchen and help you. It's just a spring time,. white chocolate bark. So I've got four cups of. white chocolate chips, and I'm gonna melt these, and all we have to do is. just follow the directions on the bag and we'll see what that says. It says, ""Microwave two cups of morsels ""in an uncovered microwave. safe bowl on high power ""for 45 seconds."" Okay, our white chocolate. chips finally melted. I was actually doubling. the chocolate chips, so it took a little bit longer. All right, so we're just. gonna stir those in, and now we're gonna spread. it onto our parchment paper. (cat meowing) My poor kitty, what? What, Pumpkin? You've been meowing and crying all day. (cat meowing). I fed her three times and nothing seems to be enough. I have that same problem. some days (laughing). Must be that time of the month. That would be a miracle,. wouldn't it, Pumpkin? Since you're very much. like me in some ways. All right, now we're just. gonna spread this out. Now, what are these little things called? This recipe is from the magazine. and sometimes we actually use. the real name of something. - [Woman] They're called Meltaways. - (laughing) Meltaways? - [Woman] Mm-hmm, and they're by Wilton. They're Wilton Meltaways. - Okay, so these are-. - Yeah, all different colors. All kinds of colors.. - These, okay, all right, let me see what I'm doing now. Yeah, Meltaways and then. we've got a tablespoon and a half of drapees. - [Eddie] Dragees. - Sragees (laughing).. - Dragees. - To me, they're coated candy. coated toppings for cookies. (Paula laughing). - Candy balls. - And then we've got nonpareils that we're gonna sprinkle. on the top of this. So we're gonna start by melting our beautiful chocolate mints and. then we're gonna just drizzle that over the base of our bark. We've got our green Meltaways melted. Idn't that pretty? Dudn't that look so Eastery? The babies are gonna love this. All of our babies, big and small. - [Eddie] Very Jackson Pollack creation. - What?. - Your Jackson Pollack creation in candy. - (laughing) Yes. Okay, now we're gonna swirl that and I'm using an extra long toothpick to just swirl that with. Oh, so pretty, so pretty. Doesn't that look pretty, Eddie? - [Eddie] It does. - Yum, yum. I love bark. Okay, now we're gonna use our blue wafers. We're gonna melt those and then we're gonna drizzle this on top. So I'm gonna drizzle the blue. over the green and the white, and it just looks so pretty. Looks so Eastery, dudn't it? Blue and green, that's. some of my favorite colors. In fact, you know, we were. remodeling the first house that Michael and I built. when we got married and I'm leaning towards blues and greens, you know all of God's colors. In fact, I want to take y'all on a tour. I mean, it looks like a bomb. went off in that house, y'all. (Eddie laughing). (Paula laughing) You know, I mean, Michael and I, were just gonna add a few extra feet. All right, so I'm gonna swirl. it with a fork this time, see if that works any better than my toothpick You see anywhere it needs swirling, Eddie? - [Eddie] I think it looks good. - Mm-hmm, I think it looks so pretty. All right, now we're gonna. put our paralase (laughing), or whatever these things are called.. - Dragees. - [Paula] Dragees. - [Eddie] You mixed nonpareils and- - Oh, I got the names bass. ackwards, like I normally do Aren't those pretty? Keeping with our green and blue theme. And, oh look, idn't that pretty? And these are the tiniest of all, and look what a pretty. finish they give to it. Beautiful, beautiful. (water pouring) This is beautiful, and the. kiddies, big and little, are gonna love it. So I've got to refrigerate. this for about 20 minutes. I know y'all have heard. me say a thousand times, I'm hoping for a piece,. but oh no, it's in storage. Well, my best friend, y'all. probably know her, it's Bubbles, Susan and her mother. Her mother is what, is she 94 now? - [Eddie] I think so, yeah. - Yeah, I think she's-. - Yeah, she'll be coming up on 95 this year. - Yeah, she's 94, Ring Ring, and she is just the sweetest little lady, and she was a pack rat though. She, I mean, not a hoarder, but everything that was good, she kept. She would pack it away and. take real good care of it, and a lot of things are. from her wedding gifts when she married. So right there, they would be. 70, 75 years old Eddie, right? Yeah, yeah.. - I would think, at least, yeah. - And so Susan sent me some pictures. They were starting to clean out and I think they were. gonna have an estate sale or something, but anyway, she said, ""Is there any pieces you. see you'd want Sissy?"" That's what we call each other, Sissy, since we don't have a sister. She's my sister and I'm her sister. But so she brought,. she hand delivered some of her mother's things, and this was one of Ring Ring's pieces. And Eddie said, he thought. it was his favorite out of every piece we got. He just went out there and. started going through the box, looking for something to. plate our Easter candy on, and of course I went and. put on my Easter bonnet, and on short notice. this was the best thing that I could find. You ain't looking at my. Easter bonnet, Eddie. - Oh.. (Paula laughing) - I'm trying to show. everybody my Easter bonnet. This was the best I could. do on such short notice, so while he was getting. his ducks in a row, I was putting on my. Easter bonnet (laughing). But look, it's three different pieces, and we finally figured it out. We've got this upside down. It should be set up with water in it, and then these little holes, you put your flowers in. and they would be in water, so I love it. Something else I love, look-a here. Look at this beautiful, beautiful bark. Just screams Easter, dudn't it? Ooh, these are some thick pieces too. I didn't do so good spreading it out. Oh, but that'll make it much. more fun to eat (giggling). Those thick, thick pieces and. I don't want to pick this up since it's in three pieces, 'cause I would like to hold onto it since it was Ring Ring's. Look at this. Am I putting it out right, Eddie? - Yes, it looks great.. - I can't, I can't see. Here's a little piece,. would you like to try it? - [Eddie] I would. - Mm, mm, mm. When my children were. little at Easter time, I would, it's so silly. I would sing this song for 'em and they would just look at. me, and I sang it to Corrie, and now I'm singing it. to the grandchildren, so here it goes. ♪ Here comes Peter Cottontail ♪ ♪ Hoppin' down the bunny trail ♪ ♪ Hippity hoppity, Easter's on its way ♪ (Paula laughing) - Oh, Paula.. - That's it. That's all my talent. (Paula laughing) Happy Easter, y'all. Love and best dishes. ♪ Here comes Peter Cottontail ♪ ♪ Hoppin' down the bunny trail ♪";['postres']

3Oxa_PwnBgk.json;- Okey dokey y'all, another air fryer recipe. And in this heat out there, heat index of 110, 115, I don't mind one bit. turning on my air fryer. So I'm gonna share with y'all, a wonderful little, if you. want just a little bite for dessert after dinner, this is definitely an easy, easy recipe. And in the Air Fryer book, which you can find this in bookstores. - [Woman] And online - And online. We have a hard time. keeping it in print though, because it's been very,. very much sought after. But the recipe in here. is for fried peach pies, but I also love apple. Apple and pear. So, I am using just a plain. old apple pie filling y'all that you get in the can. And you wanna put like a good heaping tablespoon in there. I think I'm gon' make. these for the triplets. They should be coming over tomorrow. Shouldn't they Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes they are. - So I think I'll make some. of these for them tomorrow. Those babies... - [Eddie] What are you using pie? I mean, - Oh, Oh yes. - [Eddie] Puff pastry.... - Thank you. Thank you for reminding me. I am using, no I'm using. Crescent Roll Dough. You know that you buy in the can. I'm kinda just trying to form, spread that out a little bit and you wanna start at the fatty end, and roll. And it's gon' be gooshy. It's gonna be gooshy. So, if we wanted to, so we wouldn't lose any of that filling, we could just take our fork, dip it in flour and just crimp those edges. It's really hard from here (chuckling) not to not to (chuckling) overfill. Alright, I'm gon' to try to crimp these, so they're not as pretty though that way. Okay there we go. Okay Roll roll roll squirt out squirt out (chuckles) Alright I'm not, I don't think I could crimp that end. It might be a bad end a little bit, just crimp it with my fingers. Yeah. Okay, 'cause I'm not worrying. about these being beautiful, but I am worrying about them being tasty. Okay. I make these a lot using. puff pastry, to y'all you better stay in there you little devil. (chuckles) Okay. Last one. Roll roll roll Crimp crimp (chuckling) Crimp Crimp Alright. Now I've got me an egg and. I'm just gonna brush that with an egg so they'll be shining. I'ma have a pretty, pretty color to 'em. I could say these are not the prettiest things in the world but they're really tasty and you know what, even your children or your grandchildren can come in and help grandma with these. And they're always so. proud of what they make. You know, if they don't do. anything but beat up the egg. Okay. 400, five minutes on one side, turn five minutes on the other side. Eddie's weak today (Eddie chuckles). he ain't strong enough. There you go Edwin. If you'll put it on, - [Woman] Will you start it - five minutes while I'm. washing the goop off my hands. Please. (water gushing) 10 minutes on tow, five and five. Five flip, five more. Okay y'all, 10 minutes. Alright. We decided that rather than turning. these over and disturbing 'em, it probably be better to. just keep 'em stationary for the whole 10 minutes of cooking. But before you put it in, just take your spray and. spray the bottom of it and that'll help that bottom crisp up. So, the icing that I'm gonna put on it is just like a store-bought icing. And will you just put it in. the microwave, for a minute and then just drizzle it on to your apple pies. If I was doing that for. me, I would just coat it. (chuckling) I would use a lot more y'all. Alright. Eddie I think the. triplets would love these. - [Eddie] Oh yeah. - I think they are beautiful. Beautiful. Think you can get a. little bit more on there. (both chuckle) Like you know, when you. buy those cinnamon rolls , you know, from the airport, you know, I always order an extra little cup of the icing (laughs) you know you can buy another whole thing of icing for like a quarter. Listen, now I spend that quarter. (laughs) Alright, so that's it. A wonderful little easy dessert. You can make these up ahead of time, put 'em in the refrigerator, let 'em sit. And while you're having your dinner, these can be cooking in the air fryer and then they'll be. ready for you to enjoy. It is so good. Love and best dishes y'all.;['postres']
48vL3NN2B2w.json;- Hey everybody, I'm Paula Deen, and I hope you have. room in your recipe box 'cause today we're making cookies. I'll lay it on thick with. my loaded oatmeal cookies with brown butter icing. So get out your tans. and call your friends, cookies need a crowd. Well, is everybody ready to. make my loaded oatmeal cookies? This is so, so simple. Don't let all these. ingredients up here scare you because it's very, very simple and easy. We're gonna take flour, we're. gonna see how good I am. Cloves, cinnamon, all spice, ginger, the fourth tap, a half teaspoon of nutmeg, baking soda, baking. powder, and a little salt. That was very simple. Even though it looked. like a lot of ingredients. So we're just gonna sift those together with our all purpose flour. So that's all we're gonna do there. We're gonna move on over here and we're gonna start. creaming our shortening with our butter. Love me a little Crisco in with my butter. we just gonna cream those together. The next thing we're gonna. do is add our brown sugar. So, we're gonna creme our brown sugar into our butter and Crisco. (electric mixer vibrating) Now we're gonna add one egg. (electric mixer vibrating) Alright now we're gonna. just beat in our flour and the butter milk. Beat it for a minute and then we'll add in. the last of our flour. (electric mixer vibrating) All right, the buttermilk's. worked in there and here goes to the last. (electric mixer vibrating) We're gonna add about a. teaspoon of vanilla now. (electric mixer vibrating) All right, the rest of the ingredients, we're just gonna fold in by hand and that will be our oatmeal, our nuts, now I'm using a walnut and raisins, nice fat plump raisins. So we're just gonna fold this all up. We've got our batter ready. I'm gonna get our cookie sheets. And this time I'm gonna. use the parchment paper. And we're just gonna see how that works in comparison to the other that we used. I'm gonna give it a light spray. I'm always grabbing pam, aren't I? And then I'm gonna drop it by the teaspoon full on to the paper. Now, one thing about cookies,. the most important thing is, that you make them all the same size. All right, these are. ready to go into the oven. And then we're gonna be checking on them in about eight or nine minutes. Now, while those are getting ready, we're gonna make our brown butter icing. We're gonna take a stick of butter. Y'all act surprised, and. we're gonna melt that. And we're actually gonna cook it till it's kind of a light brown. Now you'll wanna be. very, very careful here because you know that butter will burn. All right, our butter is. starting to brown a little bit, you can see it foaming up. and you can see it starting to change colors on us. All right, now we're just. gonna add the powdered sugar and mix that up together. Put in our vanilla flavoring. All right, now we're gonna. start adding our water. You'll hear me say all the. time, you can always add to, but you can't take out. So we'll wanna do a little at. the time, kinda beat that up and you can see it's just. a nice light tan color. Let's check on the cookies. and see what they look like. They should be about ready. Oh, they look so good. All right, we're ready to drizzle. And if our consistency's. not right, we'll go back. So you thought an oatmeal. cookie couldn't get any better? Why don't we get them up off of that? You can see how nice that worked for us. Don't those look delicious. I'm gonna go for this one that has the most brown. butter icing on it. Whole new twist to the oatmeal cookie. (cool music);['postres']
49LitupmsZk.json;hey y'all welcome to the kitchen today I want to read John quickly a sweet note I got from this is she sounds like a young woman dear Polly you brought me much joy with your quarantine cooking during this heartbreaking time I input data all day so I can listen to news etc when I am at the verge of tears I click on your videos and your wonderful laugh makes me smile thank you for being you PS could you please make a chocolate cream pie with the white fluffy crust lari lari Lorraine look I can't talk that Sibelius Lorraine Larry Lorraine Laurie that so sweet and honey I'm gonna make you a chocolate pie with that white crust and by white crust I think you mean meringue so I'm gonna show you the chocolate cream pie that I've made for years in fact it's in my cookbook Paula Dean's kitchen classics book oh look I use this one so much it's coming apart but I love this book so gets used a lot so this was it's an easy recipe because you don't have to stop and temper your eggs into your hot pudding so all we gonna do is mix together our dry ingredients and that's a cup of sugar and I think let's see three tablespoons of cocoa powder and two tablespoons of flour and that flour is gonna make this thick for us so you just want to take your whisk and whisk that all together and the results are almost like you sifted it so you want to break up those chunks of flour and the cocoa so that's mixed up real good step Milo's okay so we're gonna add two cups of milk and we want to do this fairly slow because if you just jump it it might have a tendency to to get lumpy Anya I love this I love this pot it's the first time I've ever used it not and I look down it says Dean brothers I knew it was a cookware that had just been shipped to me recently my boys did good it's a great great little pot alright so I'm gonna finish stirring those in and you can see I've got some butter not nearly enough butter I don't know what was wrong with me that day then I just said one tablespoon of butter and vanilla flavoring over here but we're gonna put that in after we've finished cooking our pudding all right so I'm gonna add the the three egg yolks and this is gonna help it thicken and it's gonna make that custard very rich tasting then normally most of the recipes that you find Laurie you temper your hot custard into your egg yolks and by tempering I mean we would have I get egg yolks here and then we would take hot custard and slowly mix it in with those yolks so we wouldn't have scrambled eggs so we just don't mix of yolks right in there just like this thing because it's gonna be slowly getting hot they won't be lumpy and if you want me some days you just don't want to fool with making your own pie crust so we have used a frozen with but this sound be better Eddie for me - that's good alright so I'm gonna turn this to like a medium sized and you want to whisk this about the whole time Laurie because it would stick or scorching you don't want all that to happen take my spatula and just get all that down from the side and you see that that egg just disappeared right in there so this is gonna take a few minutes but it could get hot and bubbly and when it gets thick and hot and bubbly I'm gonna take it off and I'm going to pour it into another bowl and I'm gonna add my butter in my vanilla and stir that in and then I'm gonna take a piece of wax paper or clear plastic wrap and I'm gonna Pat it down where it's touching my pudding so that way you're putting on formal crust and it will remain very very smooth when you get ready to put it into your already baked pie crust okay that well how long did I cook that it's supposed to be cooked on low but I could cooked it on like medium y'all and it may be to six or seven minutes not long bb-baby no and it's nice and thick and it's piping hot so I'm gonna pour that in a bowl and I'm gonna get every last drop out then it smell delicious and we've got a deep-dish shale I like deep dishes alright so I'm gonna add a vanilla flavoring and our butter and some butter 1 tablespoon it's not enough y'all been feeling puny that day alright so I'm just gonna stir that in until the butter melts mmm and now I'm fixing to cover it piece of plastic I'm going all the way down so it's laying on top of the custard because custard has a tendency to get a hard crust on it but if you seal off all the air and we'll be able to take that off and it will still be a nice soft consistency so I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator I'm gonna have to leave y'all again one more time I'm gonna let this cool and then we're gonna put it in our pie crust and then I'm gonna show y'all how easy it is to make Swiss meringue and you're gonna want to make Swiss meringue when you ain't got a pie in sight just gonna neat that Swiss meringue okay y'all it's time to make our Swiss meringue and I promise you that if you ever make a Swiss meringue you won't want regular meringue ever again this is I guess it would help the turtle nice go great time of day Oh so Swiss meringue it consists of six egg whites and one and a half cups of sugar and that's it now I don't know where my double baller went so I'm using a glass bowl and I've got just enough water and then you go with some water touching your bowl so don't fill it with a whole bunch of water in fact test it and make sure suit your bowl on top of your water and make sure it doesn't touch so this is very very much like seven in icing y'all so you just you just beat this and stir it until it's 140 degrees you know what I'm almost thinking I might change Theresa would you get me like oh one little little one the bigger pots out there over there in the cabinet I wanted to do this and right or the left it's like a small Dutch oven yes perfect I think this bowl let me check and see this bowl is almost too big for this for this pot so let's see if that'll know that bowl was too big for that little the top of my saucepan so I got me a bigger saucepan in a bigger bowl and I have gotten a make-your-own seven so as I was saying this is I want like 7-minute icing y'all 7-minute icing you cook for seven minutes but I don't think that's gonna take seven minutes for this now when you're doing this over your stove you can't forget your cord getting Paul into your five darling I was making 7-minute icing one day and I had to stop and do something else and I honest darling and I said would you just come continue people this for me and she's a brilliant girl she's so smart I looked around and she had left the cord go down into fire and flames Oh get out of my kitchen girl if you want to do some with a computer she can do anything but nope give her a fine thing it's hard to believe that just egg whites and sugar can make this incredible there's some of the tree and you want this to cook over boiling water down not simmering but following our chocolate pudding it should be cool enough now we can pour that into our earth crust oh you know you know you bring girl starting to look good and one other thing you'll want your egg whites at room temperature to make sure you separate your eggs earlier [Applause] I'm this better with my training hundred and forty Sharif very high temperature get close yeah it's just amazing gradients is a beautiful thing I can't jump so good bad for us [Applause] sorry adj I get you I'm gonna see what this will register I think it's there thank you I think oh gosh y'all nice up good I wish you were here too late but a bigger oh I say it's rigged and I don't know how many minutes that took it yeah well you started so I mean you're probably out of nine minute icing right well I kind of mucked up I never used that size pot to do my double boiler cooking I don't know what I was thinking maybe I wasn't thinking oh this is gonna be so good hmm I do think though in the written recipe it called for two tablespoons of flour but I really think you might need so you know how when you make a regular meringue tile you have to put it in the oven and and cook it off until the tips are brown well the Swiss meringue you don't have to do that I actually if you have a kitchen torch you can use your kitchen torch and just brown the tips I'm telling you and I listen I like to use every bit of it Therese you will eat the bone the bone [Music] so we just want to see all that that meringue onto the crust cuz you don't want you don't want any chocolate showing how beautiful is that in that beautiful and I just kind of take it and do like that just swirl it and then kind of do like that or you can do it smooth whatever your eye and your belly likes in that delicious all right so my kitchen tour child is out of juice so this is one of Michael's high-powered liners it's not burning is it baby it was yep it is now what I think you could hold they don't start it well the D yet I call myself doing that but then it goes out so Michaels not up here so but last time I made a Swiss meringue I used it with one of his torch lighter I said he uses faces cigars but it doesn't even have to have that it's beautiful just like that okay y'all I couldn't get Michaels cigar torch to work too good which reminds me I needed to stuff up my real kitchen torch Eddie help me remember Theresa helped me remember but anyway Eddie finally got it to work long enough to just do some little brown tips but we just remembered we had a partial eaten solid chocolate Easter Bunny so Eddie grated that on top so it don't need no more torching I'm gonna torch it with these right here honey I'm gonna torch the heck out of it I wish you were here to help me love and best dishes y'all have a grand day;['postres']
4BdoxELaSuc.json;"- Well, Q, I'm here in. the kitchen with Q, y'all, and she is fixing up. the last of her recipes that she's here today to share with us. Hopefully, she'll come back, I hope so. You are doing the white. chocolate brownies. - Yes, yes. - I am all in on this one. Poor Theresa, Theresa does. the shopping for our recipes. How many stores did you go. to to find white chocolate? White chocolate, is that a cheesecake? Or just pudding?. - [Theresa] No, that was just a white chocolate pudding. I went to three. (Q laughing). - You sound so happy about it. - [Theresa] Well, I read the. directions wrong to begin with. So, I bought chocolate pudding,. not white chocolate pudding. So I had to go back and correct myself, and that was not as easy as. I thought it was gonna be. - Yeah, she--. (all laughing) - Sometimes she can be. hardheaded, too, also. - So we're gonna start with. Super Moist white cake mix. That's all you need. - Okay. - If you choose to use a. different brand, that's fine. But white cake mix is the kicker. - Okay. I love recipes. that start with a cake mix because we know they're gonna be doable. - Right, exactly. - So this is gonna make a. big old pan of brownies, isn't it?. - It will. Well, it'll be thick just enough. It won't be thin, it'll be. thick like a brownie should be. So why don't you just do that.. - Okay. - And then we're gonna add two. boxes of the white chocolate. - It's hard to find.. - It's hard to find. (all laughing) - I can't believe the big grocery store out here didn't have it. Oh, I didn't get that all in there. (package rustling) What is that stuck in that bottom? (tapping box) - She won't go behind me this time. (both laughing) - Ain't nothing left in that box. - See, see, see? (Paula laughing). So we're gonna begin to fold. We're gonna fold in some. white chocolate chips, about a half a cup.. - About a half a cup, looks like. And you got some vegetable oil. - I do, I do. - And that's three quarters. of a cup it looks like. - Two thirds.. - Two thirds. Yeah, yeah. That's what it is. - We're gonna do two thirds, two times. - Would you like me to. beat these eggs for ya, or? - [Theresa] So, you. need two thirds for one, - So you did need a cup and a third. - Yeah. Yeah. So we add. (laughs) (Paula laughing) I hope that all the people. work for me watch this, so they can understand why I say, make sure you get every drop. - [Paula] Q, I can't-- - The expert even says that. - [Theresa] So, one third of a cup? - Two thirds. - [Paula] I can't help it, Q. - She's got it. - [Paula] You know, if you've ever, - The drippings and the last little bits. - [Paula] If you ever.... - All of that. Yes. Ma'am.. - [Paula] If you've ever been without, Q. - So it's two two thirds of vegetable oil. - [Theresa] So that's actually. a one and a third cup. - [Paula] Yes, yes.. - One and a third cup. - [Theresa] Look at all of us. with those great math minds. calculating in our heads. - Better y'all than me,. 'cause I don't... (laughs) - So what I was saying, if. you've ever been without, it makes you very conscious. - Of throwing away stuff.. - Of throwing away stuff, yes. Are you ready for your eggs?. - I am. - And I asked if you want me to beat 'em but I didn't hear an answer, so I just beat 'em anyway. Hope that's okay.. - [Q] We'll take it. - [Paula] Now, do you need. the hand mixer for this, Q? - [Q] No, you just fold these.. - [Paula] Oh wow! - [Q] Oh, yeah. You just fold 'em. And they'll come together and then once you fold them, - [Paula] Uh-huh. - [Q] Mix it together. - [Paula] Oh my goodness. - [Q] And it's gonna come together just like a brownie mix, like it should. And it's gonna end up being. really good brownie texture. When I make these at the shop, Q's Cakes, they absolutely love 'em. This is sort of a treat. I don't make this particular. brownie every day. So they'll be glad to see this video so they can make this. (Paula laughs). - Oh, good. - Yes, yes, yes, that's why-- - No chocolate, no milk. chocolate, or anything? It's all white chocolate - White chocolate, white chocolate. And this is a recipe that I came up with on my own. - [Paula] So you formulated this? - [Q] I formulated this. - [Paula] And did I hear. you say that you spray this? - Yes, I spray the pan. - You hadn't sprayed it though, right? - I have not. - Okay.. (spraying can) I will do that for you, miss chefie. - I Appreciate it. - Oh, here's my here's my other spatula. I like it 'cause it's... - [Theresa] A bit pliant? - Yeah. And my aunt Peggy gave this to me. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. Yes. I like it. What is this? - My bracelet. - Oh, is that your... what bracelet is that? I have one, but it kept coming unscrewed. - Mine too. - [Male voice] Your Tiffany? - Oh wait, this one shut. - [Male voice] Cartier? - Yeah. What is supposed to be an ""I love you"" bracelet. or something like that. Well, anyway, it fell off your arm. - It did. That's okay. - [Paula] And I would. hate to have to wear it, keep it and wear it.. (Paula laughs) - So I'm just putting. this in the pan evenly. - [Paula] Mm-hm. So you. pattin' it in there? - [Q] Yes. This is a lot of goodness right here. - Oh Lord have mercy, how. many calories are in it? (Paula laughs) - Ooh, be quiet.. (both laugh) - Shut up, Paula! - All right, so we're gonna put this in the oven for about 25 minutes. - You think that'll cook in 25 minutes, Q? - Mm-hm. - What temperature? 350? - 350. - I don't know what to say about this. (Paula laughs) White chocolate brownies. They're beautiful, And Q just took her white chocolate-- - Chips. - Chips, and she put two. tablespoons of oil in it, and heated it in the microwave. until the consistency is just right. So let's get our straw. (both laugh) and have a sip. - I know, right? - No she-- - So we're gonna pour, and she's gonna spread. - [Paula] Oh, gosh. Now how many chips was that? - [Q] One...was it a nine ounce bag? - [Theresa] It was a 12 ounce. - [Q] 12 ounce bag. - [Paula] 12 ounce bag. - [Theresa] We used the half a cup to go into the brownie,. - [Paula] Okay. - [Theresa] and then the. remainder of the bag-- - [Paula] is here.. - [Theresa] Mm-hm. Perfect. - [Paula] Okay. I got. turn this plate around but it gonna be so, oh, thank you. It gonna be so hot. Oh, my goodness, y'all. Now, when did you formulate this? Have you had it a long time? - Yes, I've had it a long time. - Holy moly. Okay. Do you need this to. get it all out with or...? So, you know what? - What are you thinking? - I'd probably add some nuts on top now. - I know. - I would love some nuts. Gimme that cup girl, you know. I got clean that thing out. (Paula laughs) - Uh-oh, you still got a lot. - Yeah, it's a little bit too much. - You think it's too much?. (all laugh) How about that, Q? - Now it's maybe too much.. (Paula laughs) I'm sorry, I can't help it. - Yeah, she needs a straw.. (Q laughs) (tapping) - Now. You know, we got. some more, if you want it. - It's something you told. me to remind you to say. - What did I--? oh, oh,. oh, I know what it is. I asked you to remind me. Q has joined me for sharing. three of her recipes with me. But when we first started out, we did just a video of us talking, and her sharing a little. bit of her story with you. - Yes.. - So I hope, so this'll be the fourth video, three. cooking and one talking with Q, and I do hope y'all will make sure that you see all four of 'em. And if you're ever in all Albany, drop in to see her and. see her vending machine. - Yes. At ""Q's Cakes done. the old fashioned way."" - And it's in northwest Albany. - It is, 2700 Dawson rd. suite 17. Yes. - And, oh my goodness, this looks so good. So what do you think about the nuts? - I think you can add toasted. nuts to it if you like. And it would be amazing. I've done it before at home. - Oh my gosh. - Yes. - Ooh, ooh. I just love nuts. - I do, too. - I just, I think they add so much to it, and the older I get the more I'm kind of leaning towards walnuts. - You like walnuts better? - I love walnuts. - I Like pecans. - Peecans, yeah. - Okay, peecans.. (Paula laughs) - Peecans! So you say pecans? - Yes. - It just depends on what you. learned as a child, I guess. Doesn't it? - It does. - What your mom and daddy called it. (Paula laughs) - Did we have a...? - Yes, I think I put it back in here, Q. - Okay. - Somewhere. I think I did. - Can we use the-- - Yes, that one. That one's hard for me to see right there. Oh, oh, oh, ooh! So something... - [Q] Oh my Lord. - [Paula] Holy camoly. (Q laughs) - Now, is this one gonna be. too hot for me to eat as well? - Yes. - So something else Eddie. was sharing with me... Oh my goodness, look at this stuff. Look at that stuff.. (both laugh) - [Theresa] Almost looks. like a gooey butter. - [Paula] I know. - What was Eddie sharing with you? (laughter) - Whap. Whap, make you slap your friend. (Both laugh) Eddie was telling me. that somebody said that I say his name too much. (All laugh) And I knew that! I know that I'm saying it too much. You think it's too much on these videos? You ain't seen nothing till. we turn the camera off. ""Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!"". (all laugh) If I can't get him that way,. I call him on the telephone. But, so you're exactly right. Whoever said that out. there and I'm trying to be conscious of not saying. that word too much anymore. - Lies.. (Paula laughs) And no more hate emails. (Paula laughs). - Yeah, no. Let me tell y'all, this tastes like a warm glazed donut. - It sure does, it sure does. - That is it, and if you. like warm glazed donuts, you going to love Q's recipe. - Yes. - For white chocolate brownies. - It's amazing. - (muffled) It is delicious..

4dmQ0HEkOms.json;"- Hey y'all, welcome back in the kitchen. This is a part of our apple week. You know, apples are in season and it's just wonderful to be able to use the fresh, fresh, fresh. apples in our recipes. And today I am gonna make. Paula's French apple custard and tomorrow, the video. following this one, Bobby's gonna complete the. week of apple week for us. So in the next video, it'll be Bobby making some kind of. wonderful apple dessert and I don't even know what it is myself. So I'll be sure and stay tuned. All right, now the first thing. I'm gonna do is add my sugar and my cornstarch and if it says custard, that means it's gonna be cooked. To make it real creamy. All right. And now I'm gonna slowly. add my apple juice. If I can get that to, there you go. But first of all, I want. to blend my cornstarch and my sugar together. 'Cause I don't want any. lumps in my custard. All right, now I'm slowly. gonna add my apple juice to my cornstarch and sugar mixture. Get that blended up real good. Okay, now I'm gonna add our orange zest. And that's the zest from one orange. I think I'm gonna switch. over to a spoon now because I don't want my zest to get caught up in my little whisk. All right, so next is the lemon juice and then last but not. least is our orange juice and we're gonna cook this over medium heat until it's thickened and that. will take about five minutes. - [Michael] Did you put gest in it? - Didn't I put gest in it? - [Michael] Remember what Aunt Peggy said? - Jest. She called it jest. Aunt Peggy was filming with me one day and God, love her. She and I can mutilate. the English language quicker than any two people I know. But I think she's worse. than me, isn't she Michael? - Yeah.. - As far as mutilatin'. So I said, ""Okay, what do. we need next Aunt Peggy?"" And she said, ""We need some orange jest."" I said, ""What's orange jest?"" She said, ""You know,. the grated up."" (laughs) Oh, okay. You mean zest? Yes. Little smart aleck Paula. (laughs) Oh my gosh, I just talked. to her a minute ago and made her a doctor's. appointment to come over here. So we'll see her shortly,. Michael, for her appointment. All right, I've got one. egg yolk right here. And when our ingredients get thick, I am gonna temper this one egg with a little bit of the hot custard mix. So it won't turn into a scrambled egg. So we'll do that by slowly incorporating the hot with the egg. And here's something I've. been wanting to ask y'all. I love, love, love, love, love, love when y'all send me your favorite recipes from your family or whatever. And it doesn't seem like. I've gotten any lately. Have we? Have we Theresa or Eddie? Somebody? - [Theresa] Some what, questions? - No, no, no. Some recipes. - [Theresa] We haven't gotten. a lot of recipes lately. - I know it. - [Theresa] We need some. people to send some here. - [Michael] Yeah, we. need to write a new book. (Paula laughing) - He is so funny. Write a cookbook of. other people's recipes. No, I just love it when y'all. share your stories with me and share your recipes because some that y'all send. are super, super, super good and well, none of 'em been bad, have they? Eddie?. - No. - Uh-uh, I don't recall. any of 'em being bad. But I had a favorite probably, but I don't remember what it is, so. But I remember falling in. love with one of the recipes. But anyway, if y'all. are watching out there, send me some of your favorite. recipes and your stories because it's my wish that when you see me, that it clicks something in your brain that takes you back to when you were a kid and you were in such a safe. time with mama and daddy and grandmommy and granddaddy. and aunts and uncles. Okay, it's starting to get thick. All right, so I'm gonna pull it off. Oh, it looks wonderful. Oh, and it is so thick. All right, now I'm going. to add just a little bit to the egg yolk. So pretty, isn't it? Yeah, there's nothing worse. than biting into your custard and having a spoon full of scrambled eggs. So. Oh yeah, that's nice and warm. So I'm gonna transfer that. into the rest of our custard. Come on Paula, get every bit out. And we're gonna put it back on the heat and I'm gonna cut it down some, because now we just wanna make. sure the egg yolk is cooked. This is gonna be delicious. Okay, there we go. Now I'm gonna set this to the side because we can't finish our. recipe until this is cooled. And that's gonna take a few minutes and then we'll get started on the rest. Y'all, the first thing that. I remember my Aunt Peggy teaching me how to do was a fruit tray. The second thing was. arrangements of greenery coming from your yard. She used to do the most beautiful bouquets and bring in her house and. put it in a vase in her house. And they were so pretty, but her fruit trays. And you know what, I went. to look to find a picture of some of the fruit trays. that I've done over the years. I couldn't find the first picture. So I just put together. a very small fruit tray because this French cream apple custard is gonna be so good to dip your fruit in. So I've got like a cup. and a half of heavy cream, and we're gonna whip this. And I've got my other. ingredients over here and they've cooled. It looks so good. So pretty. See the color? And I added three. tablespoons of butter to that when I took it off the heat. so the butter could melt in it and I have got, gosh, it looks. like about a third of a cup which I may need a little bit more because this is my. measurements for heavy cream, making a whipped cream. I use a fourth of a cup of. sugar per cup of heavy cream. That may be a little. sweet for some people, but it sure is good. So this is a fourth of a cup. So I don't think that's gonna be enough. I think we're gonna have to add a little bit more sugar to it, but let me see how sweet is that. I can't remember. It's so very good. And it's sweet. It's gonna take this a while to get thick because I didn't choose a very big bowl. And if I turn it on high,. it'll be all over me, all over Eddie, all over everywhere. But so Aunt Peggy taught me to. buy two beautiful pineapples. And if I need to, just trim the bottom, so one could stand up properly. And then she taught me. to take the other one and take not quite half, but leave it, cut it where your crowns of the pineapple will still be intact. You don't wanna mess with that. So just cut that pineapple. where it will leave what would you call those things on top of a pineapple Eddie? - [Eddie] Fronds I guess? - Fronds, yeah, I can't. think of another word. But anyway, she taught me. to stand up a pineapple on a beautiful silver tray, lay the other pineapple in front of it and scoop it all out because. that's gonna be our holder for our custard. And then just all kind of fruits and you wanna look at. your colors of your fruit and have not all red things. here, but have it intermingled. And it is just beautiful. So thank you Aunt Peggy. I can't believe I can't. find a picture of it. As many as I've made over the years. I'm gonna try to cut this. up a little bit more. Speed it up. I just don't want to get it all over me. All right, now I'm gonna go ahead and start adding our confectioner's sugar. I did add maybe two more tablespoons. And to me, the sweetness is just right. Now, I'm gonna take our cooled. Let me touch that. Yes,. it's nice and cool. So I'm gonna take our. juices that have thickened and I'm gonna fold this. into our whipped cream. Now you know you can use. a frozen whipped topping, but you know I just love the real deal. All right, so I'm just gonna. fold that in like that. And on my website, y'all will find some more. wonderful fruit dip recipes. Some you cook, which. would make it a custard and some is just a cream. where it requires no cooking. Look at this beautiful color. It's coming to life. It's coming to life y'all. If you wanted to enhance the color, you could add a couple of drops of maybe a yellow food coloring. But I think it's. beautiful just like it is. All right. Now I'm gonna fill up my cup. Oh, I love those streaks. of the orange in it. See the orange color? Yes, I love that. Perfect. How pretty. Now I've got whipped cream. where I slung it on there on the mint. (laughs) So you'll wanna beat your cream. away from your fruit tray. And now we've got ginger snaps, apples, watermelon,. raspberries, strawberries, red and green apples, I. don't know if I said that and the orange, the orange is so good. So being me, I think I'm gonna. go in for the ginger snap. Mm. That is so good y'all. I don't wanna double dip. So naturally I will have a little spoon. A pretty little silver spoon in my dip. So like I said, you can go on my website. and find many, many more. In fact, Aunt Peggy actually shared the French cream recipe with me. I mean the French custard. and it is delicious. The gingerbreads have a. little bit of heat to 'em and they're so good with that dip. So I hope y'all like it.. I hope you'll try it. It's wonderful at Christmas. time, a wonderful dish if you're having a little get together. I don't know how hard it would. be to get the fruits together but it makes a beautiful. dish on your Christmas or Thanksgiving table. Love & Best Dishes y'all.";['postres']
4S6qq1nvjrI.json;"- Hey, friends. You know, I was thinking, I'm so sorry that I. didn't share this recipe with y'all in time for Easter, but the good news is I. am sharing this recipe with y'all up for Mother's Day. So, how many of y'all out there. have ever made potato candy? Probably not a whole bunch of y'all, but that's what we gonna make today. And you can see right. here, this is, all right, I'm going to give you. the full measurements. It's two medium white potatoes that we've boiled and cooked until tender and in a little bit of salted water, and you drain 'em, mash 'em, and then measure out a. half a cup into a bowl, and you add the butter to the potatoes, blend well, and allow mixture to cool. And so now that it's cooled, we are going to mix in two. pounds of confectionate sugar. And I'm saying that if you. try to use white sugar, it would probably make it. really, really, really wet, so I'm gonna mix in this two pounds of confectionate sugar. I'm gon' mix it in by hand. I washed my hands. I've removed all my jewelry. and I'm just gon' go to it. Wow. Still really, really cold. So, wow. And that butter has gotten hard, but by using my hands, the warmth from my hands is gonna soften up that. butter really quick. And Theresa, would you come. do me one more favor, please? - [Theresa] Sure. What am I doing? - [Paula] Unscrewing that vanilla and- - [Eddie] Just has a foot. - [Paula] Put about a tablespoon, please. I think it calls for- - [Theresa] 1-1/2 teaspoons. - [Paula] Yeah, so, we'll double that. 'Cause we don't want it short on flavor. Thank ya. Thank you, thank you, Merdice. - [Theresa] You're welcome, welcome. - All right, so there's so many different varieties you can do with this candy. You can add nuts. You could add peanut butter, speaking of peanut butter balls. You could add coconut. If you wanted chocolate candy, you could add maybe a half a cup, a third of a cup of cocoa powder. You could, you know, the. fruit that they come out with, the candied fruit at Christmas time. You could put some of that in it. I mean, there's a lot of different ways. So, I've called in the cavalry, y'all. I have gotten where I. just, whoa. (chuckles) - Calm down. - Superman'll get it, won't he? I've just got where I. don't have much strength in my hands that I used to have, so there's some things you. really need to get married so you can have somebody to. help you make candy. (chuckles) And then you can excuse 'em after they've helped you. make the candy. (laughs) All right, so y'all,. I've decided I'm going to have to have some nuts. in some of the candy, so I'm got some chopped pecans right here, and I'm gon' mix this in. Okay, here we go. Now, the name of this recipe, y'all, is Ms. Helen's Easter Eggs. They said shape 'em into an. egg about the size of an egg, but I think that's a little much for one person to try to eat, so I'm gon' to make, oh, I wouldn't care for any more, baby. - [Michael] That's my egg. - Oh (laughs). You're a good egg. You're good egg maker. So, I'm gon' try to shape. mine like the shape of an egg, but I'm gon' make mine more. the size of a quail egg. Thank you, Michael. - [Michael] Oh, you're welcome. - I so appreciate you helping me. That made it go a lot faster. So, this is what they look like, y'all, and we made 'em in all different sizes, and for you real creative. people out there, you can, you know what? You could even roll this out and use cookie cutters,. Eddie, you know it? But the main thing is. what we got to do now. We've got to put 'em in the. frigerator for about an hour and let 'em get real hard again. Let that butter get hard, because we gon' to be dipping. 'em in melted chocolate, and I have my chocolate. back here on the stove in a double boiler, and I've got semi-sweet. chocolate and milk chocolate that I've mixed together, 'cause I really love the milk chocolate. So, thanks for helping me.. - Semi-sweet's bad? - [Paula] Yeah. (laughs) - [Michael] I can't believe. this is made out of a potato. - I know. Ms. Helen's Easter, what did she call 'em? - Easter Eggs.. - Ms. Helen's Easter Eggs. Yes. - I got a quick story for y'all. One time I asked Paula if you were stuck on a deserted island and you could only bring one. thing and one thing only, what would you bring? She says, ""A potato."" I said, ""Just one potato?"" She said, ""Yeah, I just love potatoes."" I said, ""Okay."" She said, ""What would you bring?"" I said, ""A boat."" (laughs) Then I would come get you and. your potato, and we go home. - Yeah, I'd come pick up you. and your stupid tater. (laughs) He's gotten me more. times than once, y'all, with them silly little riddles. Thank you, though, Michael. I'm gon' go put this in. the refrigerator, though, and hopefully you'll be around when it's time to dip 'em, okay? - Okay.. - Oh, and while I'm waiting for those to get hard again, I'm gon' to be trying to come up with a pretty way to. present 'em as like a gift for you to give to your mother, okay? And I say I. It's really Eddie. (chuckles) I know Eddie will come up with it, but I'm gon' help. (chuckles) So, y'all, let me tell. you what I wound up doing. So, you'll want to melt your chocolate of choice in the microwave, and don't overdo it like I did 'cause it will get back. hard on you. (chuckles) So, like I said, just make sure you don't. over-melt your chocolate, but so let me tell y'all what I did. I kept tasting 'em, and I thought, you know, I just. want another flavor in here, so I took some of it and I. put almond extract in it. Oh my goodness. It took it to another level. So, like I said, there's. so many things you can do. And I found a box that I had bought a nightlight. in the other day, and I thought, oh my. gosh, that's so pretty. I took my, oh, now my. hands are all chocolatey. But look, it's a perfect. gift for Mother's Day. Isn't that wonderful, y'all? And you can just go out in your yard and cut you some greenery and you have a wonderful gift for Mama. So, I want to wish all you girls out there a very happy Mother's Day. And being a mother is one of. the hardest jobs in the world, so congratulations,. and happy Mother's Day. Sweets for the sweet. See, we put 'em in little muffin cups? So pretty.

536XWPmAdLc.json;"- Hey, y'all, I'm in the kitchen with my favorite youngest son. (laughing) - That was very diplomatic. You sound like my father-in-law Juan, who tells me that I'm. his favorite son-in-law. - Oh, that's 'cause you. the only son-in-law. - And I'm also your only youngest son. All right, this is confusing. Hey everybody. (crew laughing) - So Bobby popped in on me earlier, y'all. And it just so happens. that I'm doing the 12 days of Christmas cookies. - Perfect timing. - So as soon as Bobby walked in the door I said ""Oh, yay, would you help me?"" So he has been helping. And you know what, the recipe that I'm. fixing to share with y'all brings back a lot of. memories concerning you and your brother, Jamie. - Yep, a little different. - I made these two brothers chocolate gobs was what I ended up calling them. - God, they're so good. - And I'd wrap 'em in. saran wrap individual. And it would make like 36. It made a lot. And I put them in the crisper-- - Fill the crisper bin. - Yes. - Down in the bottom of the refrigerator. - And you and all your. snotty nosed friends-- - And we'd raid that crisper drawer, and we would eat those. What did you call them? And we didn't call them whoopie pies, that's what they call them in Maine. - No, two brothers chocolate gobs. - Called 'em gob stoppers. Not gob stoppers. - Chocolate gobs. - Chocolate gobs. And it was just like the. softest, most gooey, delicious chocolate cake just filled. with delicious sweet. - Like fluffy-- - Cream. - Yes. - God, if I had known. what I was eating then, I would not have touched. it, but they were so good. Used to eat 'em by the bucketful. - You were young, and you didn't know that was gonna become one of your sins. - They're just the best. - Yes. - All right, so let's. whip some, what do we do? - So I'm not making the two. brothers chocolate gobs, but I am making our. cousin Johnnie Gabriel's red velvet whoopie pies. Now let me tell y'all a little. bit about my cousin, Johnnie. She is the proprietor owner of Gabriel's Bakery in Marietta, Georgia. She is a beautiful woman, (indistinct). You know, Johnnie just got married in the last year. - Oh. - Remarried, yes. And she sent me pictures. And Bobby, she was gorgeous. - Yeah, she's a pretty lady. - Gorgeous. - Very talented too. She's got a great cake place. - Oh my goodness. Bakery like no other. Her cakes are out of this world. So-- - Where do we start? - We're gonna make her. chocolate Whoopie pie. Now we're gonna start, let's start-- - As luck would have it,. there's a recipe right here. Oh, and this is cousin Johnnie's recipe. - Yes, yes. Yes, that's what we're using. - We're in for a treat, 'cause cousin Johnny makes. her living making these cakes, you understand? She gets paid for that. So this should be quite delicious. - All right. I don't believe-- - Three cups plus five. tablespoons of all purpose flour. - You know what though, this recipe is a little confusing, so I'm gonna ask Teresa to do this a little different way for y'all. You know, when you go on the website, and go into that link. - When they see the recipe it'll be a little different. - Yes. - Okay. - And I think I probably. should have added, was that-- - That was baking powder or baking soda? Yeah, baking soda. - I thought it looked like soda. - [Bobby] That's what. the recipe calls for. - And a little cocoa, because red velvet cake has that little bit of chocolate. You know how that little. bit of chocolate flavor comes in? - [Bobby] Mm-hmm, I do. Do you want me to add your oil? - [Paula] All right, well. let's do the sugar first. - [Bobby] Okay, all right. - [Paula] All right here, you do that. And I'll crack the eggs, and all that good stuff. Then I'll add the oil for ya. You know, it's the 12. days of Christmas cookies, and I think I may have some ready in the oven from something else. - [Bobby] Mm-hmm, we were. making some great cookies just a few minutes ago. - [Paula] Yes. - [Bobby] You know, Jamie and I-- - [Paula] All right, so let me add your-- - [Bobby] Oil? Yeah, that'll make it a little easier. - [Eddie] Bobby, why don't you give a quick read of some of the ingredients that (indistinct). - We can read them some of the ingredients we've already added. Three cups of all-purpose flour. A teaspoon of baking soda. Two teaspoons of cocoa powder. And one and a half cups of canola oil. (Paula laughing) I'll do it. Plus, a little, we haven't added the vinegar yet, but we're about to add some vinegar. Jamie and I went up to Maine. My brother and I had a. televisions how back in 2006 called ""Road Tasted,"" where we traveled all over the country. And we really did. We went from Seattle to Maine to Texas to California, and just everywhere in between. And we saw just so much, and met so many nice people. And we did lots and lots of recipes. And one of them-- - How much is the vinegar? How much vinegar? - whoopie pies. One teaspoon of white vinegar. - Okay. - And one of them was. whoopie pies up in Maine. - Really? - Mm-hmm, in Maine Whoopie. pies are a big deal. - [Eddie] New England, yes. - And New England. Okay, Eddie's from New Hampshire so he knows what I'm talking about. Speaking of New England, the whole part of the country up there is so beautiful. - You know, I would love. to get in the car, son, and visit all those New England states. All right, now Bobby, what I'm fixing to add now to make this a red velvet, you wanna be careful because-- - [Bobby] A little bit goes a long way. - Little bit goes a long way, and look, I just picked up a jar, a little kit that already had, and it colored me all over. All right son, come over here son, I think we're gonna have to, I think we're gonna have. to turn to the mixer to get this mixed up right. - [Bobby] We certainly got. our whisk all clogged up. - I know. (laughing) just dig it out. I'm sorry I didn't think about passing you the mixer quicker. - It's all right. It can all be worked out and fixed. It just takes a little time. Speaking of driving all. those states and visiting, my wife, Claudia, and I went up to Vermont a couple years ago,. before our kids were born. - Did you go to Ben and Jerry's? - No, we didn't do that. - Isn't that the state. home of Ben and Jerry's? - Not purposely 'cause we didn't wanna go, we didn't see it. We-- - All right, Bobby, stand back son. - [Bobby] A little bit goes a long way. - Whole bottle. If we used any less it. would be pink whoopie pies. - [Bobby] Yeah, I guess so. - [Paula] You wanna take your spatula and go around the edge? - [Bobby] So we went to-- - [Paula] But, again, now. don't splash that on you. Just loosen it from the edges. so I can keep beating it. - We went to Vermont, and we flew into Burlington and rented a car. And we drove. You know, Vermont's not that big a state. - No, it's a small state. - And we drove from Burlington all the way up to the top and back down, and we just, we went to different little restaurants. - How many miles did y'all drive? - I don't remember. - The whole trip. - It's not that big a state. So it would be the equivalent of driving from Savannah to maybe Atlanta or Rome, Georgia. You know, maybe five hours in the car. Maybe four to five hours in the car to get from Burlington. - We hadn't added our vanilla to this. - No, not yet. - Okay, just maybe like a capful, son. - So, but anyhow. We drove from Burlington up to the top of Vermont. We drove up to Woodstock, Vermont, is where we went. - Is that like Woodstock where Woodstock happened? - No.. - [Eddie] Yes. - Is it? - [Eddie] Yes. - No, Woodstock was in. New York, I thought. - [Eddie] No, I think it was Vermont. - In Woodstock, Vermont? - [Eddie] I think so. - I don't think you're right. And I don't think you're right. (Eddie laughing) - I didn't say, I just asked. - But there is a town. called Woodstock in Vermont. So we stayed there. It's such a beautiful state. - I just like the way it sounds, Vermont. - Well, you know, I. always wanted to go there. I always wanted to go there because I'm a big Ray Charles fan, right? And I just love music in general. And Ray Charles-- - But he's from Albany, Georgia. (Paula giggling) - There's a beautiful song called ""Moonlight in Vermont,"" that I'm sure other people did, but Ray Charles sang it beautifully. And it was such a romantic song. And I always wanted to, because of that song I always. wanted to visit Vermont. So we did it. And I'm glad that we did. - Well that was wonderful. I remember y'all doing that. - Yep, we did. All of New England though. is just so beautiful. Just clean, the highways, everything is just clean. - All right, Bobby, how. long does cousin Johnnie say to make these? - Cousin Johnnie says 20 minutes. - Okay. But how big does she suggest you make 'em? It'll be on the back I think. - Drop the batter by teaspoons. - [Paula] Teaspoons, okay. - Allowing one inch in between drops. As the cookies will spread. You'll be making 48 cookies. Bake until the cookies are firm, but not crisp, about 12 minutes. - Okay sonny boy. - [Bobby] All right, so that's me. - One teaspoon. Now it's important that every cookie for Whoopie pies be the same because these are gonna. be made into sandwiches. So you can't have a whoopie pie this big and then one this big and put 'em together. - [Bobby] Well this might. be a good time for a break. - [Paula] Yes. And-- - [Bobby] Not doing it right? Perfect, (indistinct) got. me out of many a task. (laughing) - I'm in the kitchen here today making these 12-- - [Eddie] 12 days of Christmas. (laughing) - 12 days of Christmas cookies. - I'm gonna let you just sit in it. - I know, you ain't helping me you little butt hole. - Spit on my mouth. - I spit on your mouth? - Sure did. - That's 'cause these pretty teeth of mine must be getting loose. - They might be. (laughing) Oh my gosh. Wow. - You hadn't seen, you hadn't seen. - Hadn't seen the bowl. No, I'm joking, but that is super nice looking. - Isn't it good looking? - This is your line? - I love melamine or melmac. We used to call it melmac. when you were a baby. But, yes, this is my newest design. And I do love it. You can't break it. - [Bobby] It's pretty. - It's got that rubber. bottom so it won't dance. - [Bobby] It's like a football helmet. - Yes, well, (indistinct). (laughing) - Should I go run into the wall. See if I can crack something. (laughing) - Is your head clean? - As clean as anybody else's I guess. It's fresh showered. - Oh good, okay that's all I need to know. All right, so Bobby's gonna have to leave, he's got another appointment to go to. - Another appointment? You're not an appointment. This is not an appointment. - You're so important. that you got appointments. - That's me. - All right, so we're gonna go ahead and make the filling real quick to these whoopie pies, 'cause I have a feeling you're not gonna be here. to stuff them with me. - No, I'm not gonna be, no. - All right so we are gonna take-- - Why so little butter? - That's not butter. This is solid shortening, and it's butter flavored. Because to make the insides. of any kind of whoopie pie you have to have that. All right, Bobby, if you. would start creaming. - It looks like butter. - If you would start. creaming that please, son. - It's an awful short cord. you got on your mixer. - I know, it is. - It's about like the leash that Claudia keeps me on. (Paula laughing) He's kidding. Are you a husband? - I certainly am, a good one. - That's the way we do it. - A fine one. - That's the way us girls-- - You gotta keep the. good ones (indistinct) the house, don't you, so they don't get away from you? - That's right. (laughing) I mean cousin Johnnie. makes hers really tiny. - How'd they come out? - Beautiful. - Oh my gosh, those are beautiful. Yeah, these are small whoopie pies those are bite size. - Yes, they're a two-bite whoopie. So y'all can see why I said it's very, very important that they're all the same size, right? - [Bobby] Yes, ma'am. I think that's pretty well creamed. - Yes, yes, yes. Now let's cream our sugar, let's put our sugar in. - All at once? Is there a technique to this or just go? - No, you can go ahead and put it all in. - [Bobby] Okay. - [Paula] Whisk, whisk, whisk. Do you remember doing that? - [Bobby] Yes. (laughing) All right, what's next? - Okay you can kind of. slow down your speed, son. - I stopped. (laughing) I slowed way down. - You did slow way down. All right so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna add our. flour into our saucepan, and we're gonna slowly,. slowly add the milk, so it won't lump. - What kind of milk are you using? - Just a regular whole milk, sweet milk. - [Bobby] Do I need to still go slow? - Yes, just give me a chance. to get it incorporated, 'cause you wanna make sure. you do this nice and slow so your flour won't be in clumps. 'Cause nobody wants to. bite into a Whoopie-- - [Bobby] A clumpy Whoopie pie. - I started to say a. Whoopie cushion. (laughing) - [Bobby] Nobody wants to. bite into those either. - A Whoopie pie. - Nobody wants a clumpy Whoopie. - No. (laughing) So you just wanna do that slow so you can-- - You ready for this one, mom? - I think you might be safe to go ahead and put it all in, son. Okay so I'm gonna, we're gonna turn that on, and if you would stir that please, until it's thickened. We probably need about. three minutes cooking that because this is gonna act as the paste between our Whoopie pies. Bobby, would you look in that oven and see if we have. anymore cookies in there? I can't remember. - [Bobby] Nope, all done. - All done. - [Bobby] All done. - Listen, speaking of all done, that's what his babies say y'all, if they don't wanna do something, all done. - [Bobby] No. - Oh, they're so cute when they do that. - [Bobby] It ain't gonna be so cute later on when they're big. - I know it. (laughing) When they tell you-- - No, all done. - They call Bobby papa. So we're gonna let this cook. for about three minutes. - Wow, that's happening pretty quick. - Oh yeah. The darn flour and little bit of milk. So we're gonna let this cook for about three minutes. Bobby, you feel free to pick that thing up and whisk away. We're gonna keep it on. the fire, baby, yeah. So we're gonna have to let. this cool completely y'all because we are gonna be. adding it to our sugar, butter and solid shortening. So if we mix it while it's hot it would just melt all that. So what I'm gonna do is stick it in the refrigerator and encourage you to cool a little bit quicker. And Bobby won't be here. - No, I gotta go, but that's all right. - Listen son, listen. - Turn it off. - Okay, I'll turn it off. - All done, all done. (laughing) - All right, so, Bobby. - Yes, ma'am. - I'm gonna get these frosted, you will not be here. - You can deliver them to my house. - I was gonna say. - At your house. - Oh, I'm so happy Bobby has a guest house fully furnished and lets me and Michael. hang our hat there. - Ooh, it's so nice, we all live together like a big ole' happy family. - Yes. And Sunday, it was just so wonderful. You got the most beautiful. yard of all of us. - Everybody's gotta stay outside, in the yard. (laughing) None of y'all are coming in my house. - Y'all he's kidding. - Well I'm kidding, but right now nobody's coming in my house. We're not doing that. - Yeah, yeah. - But it's a good thing. the yard is beautiful because everybody does, and the weather's nice. - Everybody loves to be in your yard. - Don't they? And near me. (laughing) Isn't that nice? - You're almost getting as obnoxious as my favorite oldest son. (laughing) - I just realized that I. was being very obnoxious. - Yes, you are. - But that's what family's for. All right, I gotta go. - Kick me, bruise me. - I'll come back and. make some more cookies, 'cause we got 12 days. of Christmas going on. We made two together today, and I'll come back and I'll make some more with you. - Okay that would be great. - I'll see y'all next time. - We're making all those. wonderful memories, remember? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - As long as, you have my permission to leave. - Thanks. - As long as you let your babies have one of our Whoopie pies. - Oh, 100%. Okay, bye everybody. Love you, mama. - And their face will be bright red. Bye son. - See ya. - I'll see you at our house. - [Bobby] Yeah you will. That's my house. (laughing) - Well I'm thinking about selling. - [Bobby] Okay, share the profits if there are any. - So if you roll up to your house and see a for sale sign, it's just your mama. - [Bobby] Oh good. - Bye squirt tale. - [Bobby] Bye. - Oh he's a mess. He makes me laugh. All right so this is not much, but right now it's pipping hot. So I'm putting it in the refrigerators to make it cool a little bit faster. And then we're gonna stuff our little miniature Whoopie pies. Okay y'all, I'm still. working on that 12 days of Christmas cookies, and you know what? I should be making some. dog cookies, shouldn't I? Oh my goodness, I've only made. them for two-legged people. I need to make some. for four-legged people. So we're gonna finish up the fluff for the red velvet Whoopie pies form my cousin Johnnie Gabriel, her bakery Gabriel's. in Atlanta is so good. Okay so I touched my fur babies, so let me go over here and wash my hands. Let me wash my hands. And then try to keep my hands off my fur babies while I'm cooing. Okie doke, so remember we cooked our flour and our milk together, and we put it in the refrigerator to let it thicken and cool to let it cool. It was thick. It actually takes about. three minutes total for this to get to the. stage that you need it. And like I said, this is what's gonna make our insides real fluffy. Okay. So we had already beat up our butter, our solid shortening and our sugar. Remember we had. confectioner's sugar in it. And I'm gonna add about. another teaspoon of vanilla, 'cause I do love the. flavor that vanilla gives your sweets, your cookies and your cakes. So I'm just gonna beat this together until it's all incorporated. Wait, I think-- - [Eddie] You got your. beaters in backwards? - No, I just didn't have it in there good. Okay, I thought it felt loose when I picked it up. All right, that's as high as it will go. Like I said, I just want. this to be as fluffy and airy as I can make it. If you truly drop your batter by the teaspoon full, it's gonna make a ton of whoopie pies. Normally I would probably. drop a level tablespoon of batter down, 'cause. when I make Whoopie pies, when I used to make them for my children when they were little boys, I would make 'em a little. bit bigger than that. 'Cause my recipe, it seemed like I was only making 36. Okie doke. That should be good enough. Now I need a knife. Well, how about a spoon? How about a spoon? That would work too. I'll be so glad when we have all of my kitchen stuff. back in this house. We've got just enough to get by. So after we get moved in, I'll soon have my entire kitchen back. So you just put how much. filling you want in there, and you just put it. together like a sandwich. Oh, Johnnie. - [Eddie] Perfect. - Johnnie, Johnnie, Johnnie. And you see why I said it was so important that your cookies be the same size. And of course they're gonna. vary just a little bit, but even still you can. match 'em up pretty good. Don't those look delicious, Eddie? - [Eddie] Perfect, yes. Nice little snack. - Mm-hmm. Yes, and they're not so big. that it'll ruin your appetite. Or perfect little after supper, little bit of something sweet. The older I get, I just love having a bite of. something sweet after a meal, and usually it's ice cream. In fact, I find myself. eating ice cream every night, which is not good. Oh, it's good all right, it taste real good, but... So that's it. That is it. I'm gonna come over here y'all, and add these to the tray. I've got mema's kitchen sink cookies that I did on another video. And now I've got the Whoopie pies. And I'm gonna be making some. more real good stuff, y'all. So you stick with me for 12 days now, 'cause it's all so good and so sweet. So that gets it. Thank you cousin Johnnie for being you. I love you, girl. Merry Christmas.";['postres']

5pQQ8ZVOcrc.json;- Hey, y'all! I'm over the moon happy today, because my oldest grandson. Jack is here in the kitchen - Yep. - And I think you actually asked somebody to bring you over here didn't you? - Yes I did. - Which makes it even better. - I love cooking. - I do too, but I love cooking with you. Especially cooking with you. You're old enough now, you understand it. The next age group down, they don't have any kitchen knowledge yet. You know, so you have to watch them close, but you got it going on. - Matty still likes to make. concoctions in the kitchen, which is whenever he takes. a bunch of random food and puts it all together, freezes it, and then forces me to eat it. (Paula laughs) - And he actually forces you. - I mean, it's kind of like,. - Do you eat it? - I mean, mm so good. (Paula laughs) - Well, you know, that's. the fun thing about cooking because you can just. do what appeals to you. Except in baking, because. that is definitely science. That's a formula. So you need to stick to. the recipes for that one. All right. I'm heating up our fudge sauce. This is a wonderful, homemade fudge sauce that I used to make for your daddy and uncle Bobby when they were. like five or six years old. And it's so good. And I made it for you also. Well, we are going to be making,. because I'm here with Jack. And there is how many, 4 other grandsons here. outside swimming and playing? - Yeah 4. - So Jack, if you would. beat up this yolk, please. - All right. - And then, - Do we add the milk first? - Yeah, nuh-uh, after you get it beat up. That's it. - [Ed] Tell us what we're making. - Air fryer s'mores. - [Paula] Yes! - It's going to be delicious, and then we'll go serve it. to all little boys out there. - Is that the same size? Is that the same size bowl? I was gonna give you. one a little bit bigger if you needed it. Okay. So you can put the egg in there - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] and finish it. in there or in your bowl. whichever you want. I think you made the right choice. That gives you a little bit. more playing room, doesn't it? - [Jack] Yes it does.. - [Paula] Okay. So Jack told you we were making s'mores. And these are easy s'mores because I don't have to. go out and light a grill or start a fire, turn on. the fireplace, nothing. All I have to do is turn on the air fryer. All right. So Jack has got us some egg wash and over here we have. got our egg wrappers. Some grocery stores,. they will be in produce. Some grocery stores,. they'll be in the dairy, but it's a refrigerated product. So you may have to look. a couple of places. All right, so Jack let's,. I'll demo the first one, okay? - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] If you would. just come around the edges, just like that and just moisten those when we get ready to roll them up. - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] There you go sonny boy. Just like that first one. And then we're gonna put two. tablespoons of chunky frosting. And we're just going to use. a store bought frosting. And this one's good, 'cause I like milk. chocolate and this is milk. - Me too - So we gonna put two. tablespoons in the center. You can work around that can't you baby? - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Okay, now switch sides. - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Okay Now, do you know what, in my recipe it says. use large egg wrappers. So, I don't know if they make them any larger than this or not. - Yeah, I think this is the right size. - You think, okay. Because, it would really have to be a giant one. So I don't know if we're going to need two tablespoons in each one. I don't know. I'm kind of smearing it around. That's good, precious. - [Jack] All right. - And that'll help the. rolls stick to each other. Just gonna kind of spread it out. Now we're gonna put two marshmallows - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] in each egg wrapper. Egg roll wrapper. - [Jack] Put it on top of. the chocolate frosting. - [Paula] Uh-huh. Okay. There you go, pumpkin. Yes! - [Jack] This is going to be so good. - [Paula] Yes! - [Ed] These are fancy s'mores. - [Paula] I mean they're fancy. Do you know what Jack? I'm a nut lover. So I'd love some nuts sprinkled in these. - [Jack] Oh, that'd be delicious. - [Paula] You do think so? - [Jack] I think so.. - [Paula] Okay. Let's do it. - [Jack] What nuts? - [Paula] We'll do just a few nuts. How about that?. - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] Would you rather. have slivered almonds or chopped pecans? - [Jack] I think pecans would be the best. - [Paula] Okay. And I guess we just put it around where it'll stick in the chocolate. Yes! All right. Let's see if I can roll this up. Okay. All right, we're gonna. need some more egg wash. I forgot that. I forgot that you're. going to be folding these, so we need some there. They kind of split on me. How does the egg roll people do it? Is it just like that, or do they? I can't. - [Jack] I think that'll be good. - [Paula] I've never worked. in a, oh, you know what? Those are supposed to go on the inside. I've never worked in an. Asian restaurant, y'all. All right. Watch it, Grace. Watch it, Grace. Yeah. I just missed a little. somethings, something here. - [Jack] That looks good. - [Paula] Not too bad. We're ready for the next step, Jack. All right?. - [Jack] Yep. - We're going to brush. these with our egg wash because that is going to help these graham cracker crumbs. stick to our egg roll. So see it surely, most. certainly will be, a s'mores because we got our graham crackers, we've got the marshmallows, and we've got the chocolate in there. - [Jack] So am I gonna want. to get, just these sides? - Uh-huh, all. Uh-huh, no, all of it so that - [Jack] All of it. All right. - [Paula] Yeah. Don't be scared. (Paula laughs) - [Jack] Here you go. - [Paula] Okay thank you. - [Jack] Roll it in there. - [Paula] Okay, these look great. Don't be scared to wet. it though Jack, okay? - [Jack] Yes. Ma'am. - [Paula] Because that's. what's going to help those crumbles stick to it. I want to get all my crumbs that I'm due. (Paula laughs) Don't you? - [Jack] Oh, that looks so good. - [Paula] Doesn't it look delicious? This is such a good recipe to make with one of your grand children or if you're a mother of young children. Especially if you have an air fryer and you don't have to worry about frying these up in deep grease like they do at the Asian restaurants. So you don't have to worry. about them burning themselves. Okay, we're going to need. a few more graham crackers. Teresa knew. - [Jack] Could you cook this in the oven? - [Paula] Yes. You could. You can deep fry them. This air fryer, my air. fryer is the bomb, Jack. It cooks things very quickly. Okie dokie. Jack finish getting that top. off of there for me, please. - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - And I'm going to take our, well, what's wrong with this? Why won't it work? Jack what am I doing wrong? - [Jack] Is it, is there something? - [Paula] It won't come out. - [Theresa] Do you have to turn it? - Yeah. - Don't squirt yourself in the eye. Accidentally. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. It's child proof, y'all. All right. Did you see something on there. that told you that, Jack? - [Jack] No ma'am. - [Paula] Oh, look.. - [Jack] Yeah, that's good. - [Paula] Now, that's the ticket. Whoops. I'm going to take uh oh! I'm gonna take this one back. out and coat him some more. Look, that one's so torn Jack. It's going to ooze out everywhere. - [Jack] Yeah. - [Theresa] Those are the best. - [Paula] Yep. By spraying those, Jack, it's. gonna help them get crispy. Why don't you spray. - [Jack] All right. - [Paula] And I dip. How about that? - [Jack] All right. I can do that. - [Paula] Yay. I sure do like putting. them in those crumbs after it's been sprayed. 'Cause that's the way we really getting some Graham crackers. - [Jack] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Here you go, baby. Look, see that didn't even. look like it had any on it with just the egg wash did it Jack? Okay. In the oven. How long in the air fryer? - [Jack] Five minutes on each side. So you wanna cook it for Five minutes - At what temperature? - And then flip it over. At 400 degrees. - [Paula] Okay. - [Jack] Five minutes. - Okay. Five minutes. We'll turn them over. And we sprayed all sides. So we may not have to. spray them again, Jack. But we'll see, okay? - Okay. - They look so good. And listen, now my last step, I am telling y'all to. drizzle it with chocolate, but look at this. I'm not gonna have to. do much drizzling, am I? (Paula laughing) Because Jack and I made them so fat, but we're still going to just drizzle them with some of our homemade. chocolate fudge sauce that Theresa made. - [Theresa] And you told. them that's a video, right? If they want to go on. - [Paula] No, I didn't. - [Theresa] Oh yeah, we made that. - [Paula] Yes, on a video. - [Theresa] On a video, another video. - [Paula] And this is so easy to make. - [Theresa] And so worth it. - [Paula] Theresa was just flabbergasted. The first time she ever saw me make it. She said, it's that easy? Yeah. - [Theresa] And it's that decadent. - [Paula] And it's that decadent. So just a little drizzle. (Paula laughing) Just a little drizzle. I like a little drizzle. Just a little drizzle. Shut up, Paula and get. those on out of there. I just can't seem to get. enough on those right there. - [Ed] I think you, - [Paula] You think I've drizzled out? - [Ed] I think you're past drizzling. You may have just, - [Paula] surpassed. - Mm. What do you think, Mr. Ed? Mr. Ed, he was talking a horse wasn't he? Of course. All right. - [Theresa] And there she goes again. - [Paula] So just to make it official. Since I dropped a little. fudge sauce on the edge, we'll just fix it. Like it was supposed to be there. - [Theresa] Yum. - Looks good enough to. eat doesn't it y'all? All right. Let's take this outside because I've got five. hungry, young men out there. Y'all there's nothing better than feeding your grandchildren. Maybe cooking with them. A lot of fun too. But, makes me so happy, - [Child] Thank you Guinea.. - to get in my kitchen and fix something that my grandchildren. They think Guinea's a genius. - [Child] How'd you make this? It's so good. - Best dishes and love y'all.;['postres']

I ever drank coffee, I was in my later 50s, and Michael said, ""I can't believe you don't drink coffee."" So I said, well, ""You know I gotta try."" 'Cause he came up with a. line of his own coffee. So I'm doing a icy coffee punch. Now, that was two, was that? - [Theresa] Four cups. - Four cups of milk, and I've got three cups of black coffee. I'm just gonna mix those together. This is super, super simple, and a great way to have your coffee. All right, I'm gonna need a half a cup. I don't know if this screws off. I don't think it does. I'm going to do it this way. I need a half a cup up of chocolate syrup, so y'all bear with me.

(chuckles) Okay, I meant to spray that, and I forgot. (chuckles) You know this is gonna be good. Okay, so you would put. it in the refrigerator just like this after you. get it mixed up good, and like Theresa was saying,. that'll last several days, 'cause it'd be hard to drink that in one sitting, wouldn't it? - [Theresa] Unless you were. serving it like at a party. - Oh yes. - [Theresa] What a great brunch. - Yes, uh oh, I got some on the- All right, so now I'm gonna take a scoop of ice cream, and I got. busy doing something else, so this melted a little bit, and I'm slinging it everywhere. And I'm just gonna cover the ice cream with my coffee mixture.

friends with the young woman that's family owned it and uh i just really liked her a lot her name was donna and she was she was funny she was witty and but uh she and her family eventually sold it and they moved on to atlanta to open up uh what was their name over daddy chateau elan yes so i understand that they have a wonderful winery is it a winery any up there yeah so if you're near atlanta you can check that out but donna should you be watching hey girl i've missed you over the last 17 years gosh it's been a long time but anyway donna had to uh prepare breakfast for all of her guests and i guess i was over there one day and tasted this because i i liked it well enough to ask her for the recipe so that's where this comes from all right now we're using one can of big um canned buttermilk biscuits and we're cutting those into fourths and then we have some melted butter that we're gonna dip these in okay so to our half a cup of brown sugar i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and this one's just about empty but there we got a half a half a teaspoon and we're just gonna mix this up good with a fork to make sure that cinnamon gets mixed up with all that brown sugar you know i thought this was a great breakfast or brunch idea because it was so easy to prepare and so tasty all right there we go so i'm going to spray our pan and i i think this is a 9x9 maybe that stuff doesn't taste good to breathe all right so into our melted butter and then into our brown sugar and then we're just going to tuck those close together right in there okay y'all i definitely had to go back and get another half a cup of brown sugar and that's what's left after using a full cup of brown sugar so i'm just tucking these in i finally got them dipped in coated with the brown sugar so we're just going to kind of push those down and now we're going to cover them with a half a cup of quick cooking oats so see this is heart healthy right eddie the top part is i guess if you just eat the oaks off of it oats i call them oaks and like a tree okay so now we're going to take our cup of blueberries and we're going to toss them with a half a cup of sugar and we're just going to toss till it's all that sugar is coated on those blueberries we're taking something very healthy and [Music] making it a little unhealthy right my doctor told me to eat plenty of blueberries but he didn't tell me to eat them coated with sugar all right so i'm just gonna says to spoon them over but i'm just gonna take my hands so hopefully i'll lose some of that sugar i don't think we're gonna need every bit of that [Music] okay this is so good y'all so if you're having company or you're having the girls over for brunch it'll be perfect all right so now we're going to cover that with the last half a cup of our quick cooking oats [Music] and then can y'all guess what we're gonna do next we're gonna pour our butter our other half a stick of butter we're just gonna drizzle that on top and you might need a little bit more butter than just one stick you know in case you use too much on your biscuit pieces yeah it looks good doesn't that look good it's gonna be so good yum all right so we're gonna put this in the oven and donna tells us to uh preheat the oven to 375 degrees and we are going to bake it for 20 minutes or until cake is golden brown and center is done that's not a cake is it yeah it's a coffee cake granite steps country blueberry coffee cake so i stand corrected it's a cake so i'm gonna set the timer for 20 minutes and we'll see what we got okay y'all our granite steps country blueberry coffee cake is out of the oven i mean this thing's stained slower look where i use my hot plate to get it out that blueberry color is hard to get out eddie um so this is still very hot so i hope it'll cut good uh i wound up cooking it it said for 20 minutes y'all i probably wound up cooking it almost 15 minutes longer so you'll just have to watch yours and depend on your oven oh my gosh it brings back so many memories when i lived downtown and donna lived at the granite steps b and b so i hope wherever you are donna that you're doing well and i have fond memories of our talks and our chats and our food this is beautiful it's gonna be hot mm-hmm i'm hot but it is so delicious and like i said i know that's good for me with all those it's got blueberries stuff in it we all get y'all a piece cause it's good is emily still here no she left she ran while she could loving best dishes y'all this is so good hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this video be sure to

65L8kymqukQ.json;hey y'all come on in the house you know I know it's a little early but I'm already planning on some of the desserts that I'm gonna make for the 4th of July celebration and I think this one is perfect and you can find the recipe in my issue of cooking with Paula Deen magazine it's there's a beautiful picture in there so you can see what we have in mind when we were putting the recipe together but this is real simple it's one of those recipes that you just gonna love to keep in your little recipe box and you know I was talking about convenience products that you can find now this is a very good convenience product it is a no bake cheesecake filling and it tastes just like cheesecake and this is in your dairy section right Theresa is it with the egg cream cheese bags and the cream cheese yes all right so we're using two of those and these are gosh I don't see the size on me and I know it's got to be there young it probably comes in just one size it does Oh net weight twenty four point three ounces all right now I'm gonna take our cheesecake filling into that I'm gonna add some lemon curd so this is just gonna make it give it a lemony fresh cool taste and somehow lemon just tastes so good in hot weather I don't know why all right I used a fourth of a cup of lemon curd so I'm just gonna mix that in and if you wanted it more lemony you could you could add more curd to it it looks so good looks like a white cloud that you just could dive into it's so hot outside you're so hot just dive into a cloud of coolness okay now I've got my trifle bow you'll need like a three and a half quart and I'm gonna start by putting two and one-third cup on the bottom layer and I love love my measuring cups these are so good what I'm doing right now I use them all the time when I'm loading my cake pans up with cake batter because I can make sure they are gonna be perfectly even all right so we're just gonna press that down and around until we've coated the bottom oh you know what I can do maybe I've got a magazine over there I think that this recipe was in do I not Theresa do I have the magazine I do not we don't have it here I do not actually it's coming out it is it is the recipe it has been in one of our other magazine okay all right now I'm gonna add two cups of crushed vanilla wafers so I use these a lot yeah I mean coming in here maybe three sets all right this is crushed up vanilla wafers and I'm just gonna sprinkle 2 cups of a no-bake dessert you're in the hottest months of the year okay okay next is strawberries or raspberries blackberries and blueberries alright I'm going to divide the fruit into two cups each layer gets two cups so raspberries are a soft little fruit okay so that's one cup okay and then we're gonna go to our blues and take out one more cup so this will be two cups of fruit that we've used how's that looking Teresa hmm they look good you know and this is almost well I don't know if it's healthy healthy but it's a great way to get the kids to eat their fruit don't you don't you agree all right we're gonna come back in now with another layer your cheesecake dollop that on top then I'm trying to spread it around with now disturbing the berries too much okay that's one cup sails columns that's all I did sounds calm to begin Salam okay so we're gonna have to very gently spread that cheesecake filling over our fruit oh gosh it's looking pretty you know people are gonna think you worked very very hard on this recipe and it's so easy all you have to do is spray it spray it spray it and everybody loves cheese take that back who doesn't love cheesecake okay and I need another third of a cup all right now I'm just gonna take the paper towel and try to clean up right there right there and right there outside the bubble where was touching it that looks pretty good look for the plane too young okie-dokie all right two more cups of crumbs [Music] okie-dokie that's pretty okay we added two more cups of the crushed vanilla wafers and now we're adding two cups more of our fruit and this looks so good or save a few for the time okay now comes in I believe I blew blackberries okay and now our blueberries love it a lot in this cloudy it looks good you know the fourth of July is such a fun day to spend with your family and friends and you want it to be easy so you can do this the night before and then just pull it out and you're all ready to celebrate alright so the next thing that goes on oh no one second okay sorry about that all right so in goes our cheesecake topping on top of all that wonderful fresh fruit you know and you know by all means use your favorite fruit if you don't like blackberries for some reason then you don't have to use them you can use all blueberries but what we want to do since this is a fourth of July cake is make sure we got our red white and blue how are you you are just in terms on guess what are we with everybody we're with everybody everybody should be jealous this is our fourth of July son thanks it looks like the fourth of July I know it's red white and blue almost could stand some more cheesecake feelings but well is this the sampler no no you'll get the sampling tomorrow yeah can I help I don't think so son I'm I'm just having to delicately you know the Cheesecake Denton room yeah that's hard yeah for sure yeah so tell me what I'm looking at you're looking at cuz it looks like a trifle you are looking at yeah lemon very drunk yeah we're dirty trifle because the reason the lemon has worked in on it is because the cheesecake filling has lemon curd mm-hmm so it gives it that just a little light clean oh it's gonna be so good you know who's gonna love that me well besides you you everybody your baby yeah they will love it yes so what do you do you put this in the refrigerator oh yes yes so see I'm getting all the work done today yeah Bobby uh-huh and then tomorrow you can just have fun I'm just having fun that's the way I'm just gonna have fun smaller planet yes and I'm just gonna clean this up a little bit where I got some what goes on top could you like shave some lemon zest on top of that or something there's some color what would you do well maybe sweet mint sprigs Oh anything personally what I like on top is my two layups you still alright so here's what we're gonna do the Crone's this is this is banana yes vanilla wafers like some people use on banana pudding and then we're just gonna put our fruit on top but I don't think I'm gonna do that yet I think I think I may wait put it in the refrigerator at this point yawn and then tomorrow just put my fruit on top of it don't you think so or should I do it named jealousy you know what this is partly because I've got a talk about me for a second let's talk about

6JvWbsKh3IQ.json;"- Hey, y'all. I am fixing to whip up the. most incredible little pecan... They're not pies. Little pecan muffins. They're mini muffins, and. they will melt in your mouth. Well, so, let me tell. you why I'm making them. The corporate office. got a call here in town from the team, Savannah Bananas, and they are a semi-pro. team that we have here, Ed, tell me, help me fill in the blanks on Sava--. - [Ed] They're baseball. - Yeah, it's baseball, did I not say that? Theresa, what are you doing. that you ain't answering me? - [Theresa] I don't know, I. mean, I don't really, I mean, (laughing) Jesse contacted me, is who we contacted. - Jesse, Jesse owns... - Jesse Colt... - [Ed] Cole. - Cole. I couldn't remember. what his last name was, but a very nice guy. And he's owned it now for. about four or five years? - [Theresa] Five. - Five years. He has. done an incredible job, and the stadium is. located on victory drive. And I'm telling you what. people really turn out. Don't they Theresa? - [Theresa] And this is the big deal, because they won the very. first year they were ever, they went to the championship. game and the won, and this is the fifth year, and they're going back. to the championship. - Oh good. - [Theresa] That's why. they've invited you. - Oh, oh, okay. - I hope everybody heard that. This is their first. Did you say this was the first? - [Theresa] This will be their fifth year, and they're going back. to the championship. They won it their first year. - Oh, okay. So five years ago they won. it and now they're going back - [Theresa] Yeah! - to try to win it again and. tonight is, is it the finals? - [Theresa] This is a second. game. So it's the best... It's the best - Okay, cause last night they won. - [Theresa] two out of three. so that if they win tonight, they won, but it could go to the south. It could go tomorrow. The outcome. - So I'm so excited. I have worked with Jesse before. I know I remember doing a. Christmas video with the, with the team a few years ago, and I've dressed up like Ms. Claus, and it was like in July, I thought I was going. to die from the heat, but these guys are so cute. and they're very, very good. So anyway, the person that. called the corporate office, I don't know if it was JC or not, but they said they've got. some big Paula Deen fans on the team, and would I. possibly come and just speak to them tonight before the. game and give them an attaboy? Well, of course I am honored. and delighted to do that. And I called all around to see. how many grandchildren would want to go, because I'll actually. be in the dugout, I think, right, Theresa? - [Ed] We're going to. go to the locker room. - Oh, we're goin into. the locker room y'all! - [Ed] Just ahead of the game, and then we'll go to the stadium - Good! Well, all the, all the grand babies. already have some plans, but Jamie is bringing Maddie and Jack. So I'm hoping that they'll go. into the locker room with me and get to meet these guys, because they are good. and they're dedicated. So we can't go empty handed.. We have to take them a treat. Don't we? Well, Eddie and I decided to. make them our little, pecan, let's just call them tarts. It's not really a tart, but. it's in the mini muffin pan. And cause Eddie said something about taking a banana nut. bread, but you know what? I just have had these little. things on my brain and I said, oh, let's make those, and Eddie said okay! And we can make a buttercream icing, and get some banana chips. and stick a banana chip on top of our muffin to let them know that we're really thinking. about the Savannah Banana team. So that's what we're going. to do. And this is so simple. You want some don't ya Mike? - [Mike] No. - You lyin! Haha! You lie! You lying. All right, I'm gonna take my flour and my brown sugar. And this is one cup of packed. brown sugar and a half a cup of all purpose flour. And I'm just going to mix. those two things together real well. We don't have to pull out. a mixer for this one y'all, and when I don't have to use a mixer, oh, it's a good day. It is a good day. So I'm going to get, I'm going to get my whisk. The reason Michael said. he didn't want one, He's been doing so good on his diet. He went to key west to the. Ernest Hemingway look alike and he kind of fell off the wagon. and he's had trouble crawling back up the wagon. Hadn't you? Michael? Oh he's crying y'all. (laughing) Hims crying. (laughing) - Don't cry. Big fat baby. (cackle laugh) Did you hear me, Michael? - [Mike] No. - He has so got me tuned out y'all Alright now, you need two eggs that. are slightly beaten, alright I'm going to get a spatula, and get every bit of that out. (dish clashes in sink) - And then we've got two thirds. of a cup of melted butter. Now, you know, it's good. That's flour, butter, (spatula taps on bowl) - sugar, and eggs. (dish clashes in sink) - And then we gonna top. these puppies off with, like a cup of chopped nuts. Where are you going? Crazy. You can have one muffin. Okay. So let's just review. It's one cup of packed, brown sugar, a half a cup of all purpose flour, one cup of chopped pecans, two thirds a cup of melted. butter, and two eggs. That is it y'all. And Eddie, Eddie makes these a lot for us when we need a quick snack. If I'm, if I don't have time, Eddie will jump in here and make these, and Eddie cooks his about 13 minutes, Eddie? - [Ed] Yeah. It doesn't take,. it doesn't take very long. - So I liked them where they'll. they they'll fall and then they'll get like a gooey center to them. So I don't want them to. have the texture of a cake. - [Ed] Yeah. I think if. you start checking it with, if the rim starts turning brown, that's, - Yes! - [Ed] that's just about it. - So you want to make. sure that you spray your mini muffin tan and you know, it's hard to spray little mini muffins. So this is what I do. (grease can sprays) - [Ed] You know, Jesse. - I'm about out. - [Ed] Jesse reminds me. of a modern day PT Barnum (cackle laugh) - [Ed] out of the greatest showman. I mean, he does such a great little act throughout the whole show. I mean, or gain. So call it a shack. (laughing) - No, it's for real. The game is for real. What does he do? Where. are you going Mikey? You go and take your records and go home. - [Mike] Nope. - What are you going to do? - I'm making a wasp trap - Oh. And show us what you doing. - I got jelly and water mixture, and that's my wasp trap - [Paula] And where's your wasp trap? - This is going to be over. on the other end of the house - [Paula] Oh, haha! You know, Bobby's got wasp out here. in this back porch y'all, and it's a kind of wasp. that they drill holes. It looks like a woodpecker doesn't it? Has been out there. Doesn't it Mikey? All right. Now I'm gonna. just grease my dipper and just scoop these right on up. To me, that's the perfect, perfect size. Is that about what you do, Eddie? - [Ed] Yeah. - Okay. So I'm fixing to. run these in the oven. I've got them dipped. and we'll see you back in like 10 or 12 minutes. All right. I told y'all it. was going to be really quick, and 350, I don't know if. I told you a preheat temp, but it's 350 and this is. how they turn out y'all They are incredible. See all the pecan? Got that wonderful gooey center. It's just like a little bite. of heaven, and I'm not kidding. - And all these need is my teeth, but because this is a gift, we're gonna do a little. pretty pretty to them. Savannah Bananas. The guys are gonna love them. So there you go. Just that easy. And I'll be back with. y'all for another video once I get to the stadium. and you can see all the guys, they're just neat guys. Hey, y'all I'm here in Savannah, Georgia at the Savannah Bananas stadium. and everybody is hyped up. If they win the game tonight, that means they win the championship. So I'm going to go surprise the boys, they don't know I'm coming. (band plays) - Take a look at all these folks, a bunch of Savannah Bananas around here! This is the king of Savannah Bananas. (everyone cheers and claps) (team shouts ""Paula"") - [Guy In Yellow Suit]. Paula wants to say a few. - [Paula] Thank you guys so much, for all the entertainment you bring to us, and all the enjoyment. I didn't bring enough muffins! (team laughs) - [Guy In Yellow Suit] No, you're good. - [Paula] So I want to tell. y'all what I made today. I shot a show earlier today, and I said I'm going to see. the Savannah bananas tonight. - [Team] And? - [Paula] What'd you say that for, why did you, why did you smile? (team laughs) - [Paula] I thought I. said something wrong! Anyway, I've got a recipe for the best, little pecan tart that you've. ever put in your mouth. (team woos) - [Paula] But we did a little. something extra to them guys. We put a little cream cheese icing, and a banana slice on top. (team whoops) - [Paula] These are the. Savannah Banana muffins (clapping and inaudible chatter) - [Paula] Y'all have one and pass. - [Team] Thank you! - [Paula] Can I have a. picture made with y'all? - [Team] Yes Ma'am! - [Guy In Yellow Suit]. Jump right over here. (hollers and wows) - [Camera Guy] It got. quiet all of a sudden. - On 3. 1, 2, 3. - Y'all, I have been asked by the team, if I would throw out the first pitch along with my grand boys, Jack and Maddie, so I'm going to home base. (announcer inaudible) - [Announcer] Please welcome, Paula Deen. (hollers and whistles) - On their way to the. mound are her two nephews, grandsons, I'm sorry. Paula, it's her grandsons.

7Bu6CTUyoxE.json;there's all different kind of popcorns that you can buy out there you can buy it already bagged up pre-cooked but i just love doing it the old-timey way this really brings back some nice memories i'm gonna put just enough oil to slightly slightly cover our pan and then i'm gonna put a single layer of popcorn in the pot and you can see when i shake it up that makes like a single layer we don't want to overfill our pot because when it starts popping we could have a big mess naturally i had the pot already hot when i poured in the oil you can hear the popcorn sizzling in that oil this is dangerous because we don't know when one of those kernels are going to come flying up up there it went i remember that my mother had a popcorn pot that she used on top of the stove and it had a clear lid so we could watch it as it popped but i don't think they make those anymore but maybe i could find one at a junk shop i can't eat it fast enough don't do that at home kitties i'm just having fun and you can hear it you can hear it popping and we're just going to shake that pan because if i just left that pan sitting there there's a good chance that the popcorn might burn and we don't want that there's all different popcorns now that you can use instead of popping your own all different brands but i would recommend an unsalted popcorn for this recipe okay the pot is quiet so i think all the kernels have popped let's take a look and hopefully there's no burned popcorn on the bottom there's not one burned kernel in our pot now while our popcorn is cooling we're gonna come over here and we're gonna make our chocolate coating that's gonna just make these luscious chocolate filled popcorn balls and we're gonna start with a half a stick of butter always butter sugar cocoa corn syrup doesn't it seem like forever when you're draining corn syrup out of a bottle a pinch of salt we've got all of our ingredients in here now we're just going to bring them to a bowl and that shouldn't take very very long you know i remember my grandmother paul making these for the young children in our family i tried not to call on my grandmother very often to keep my children because i felt like she had already done her job with her children and i hated to pawn her great-grandchildren off on her but when i had to call on her she would make sure she had these popcorn balls as a snack for my children and everything would be all right she was a wonderful grandmother in fact both of my grandmothers were just the best i had one that i swear that walked around with a halo over her head and then i had another one that was spicy and i think it sometimes she had little horns coming out of hers so i had a nice variety i was most lucky the feisty grandmother's name was irene and she was the one that i spent many many years in the kitchen with and the other grandmother was nellie lou and i have fun fond memories of irene and little nelly lou this has come to a boil and the sugar's dissolved so now we're gonna add eight cups of popcorn to our pot a heaping one for good luck oh these are looking so good and if you wanted to you know you could even add some chopped peanuts or pecans to it it'd almost make it like a chocolate cracker jack wouldn't it i know those two little boys of mine sure did love these so i think tonight while we're watching the movie there'll be other little children around that'll love them just as much as mine did so we're going to let this cool for a minute and then i'm going to just mold them into their shape i've got a nice coating on our popcorn now i'm just going to pour down to our cookie sheet and let it cool for a minute so that i can touch it because it's still kind of warm look at the threads my granddaddy was aggravate me i was 15 years old and i ran to her and i said grandma he won't leave me alone and i remember her walking in and she had a sofa that sat out in the middle that floated and granddaddy was happened to be standing behind the sofa she walked out there with her hands on her hips and she said johnny i told you to leave her alone and he said i'm not bothering her well she walks out he aggravates me some more i run back and get her again and this time when she comes back into the room she said i told you john paul to leave that child alone and i mean it and she balled up her left fist knocked him for a loop sent him and the sofa flying over and i walked around the sofa and i looked down and i said i told you to leave me alone she was a sport my grandma like i said i adored both of my grandmothers they were just so entirely different and i have people say oh you're just like nellie lou and then i'll have people say oh my god you're just like irene so and these are heavenly even if you think you might be sinning cause you know popcorn it's a vegetable how bad can it be for you not not that bad it's just air [Laughter] and we all know air ain't fattening these are actually fun to do and after they cool off the children can help do this they'd have a ball doing it that's it they're ready for the movie well i've got all of our snacks ready all i have to do now is get changed and then we're off to the movie hey y'all it's paula dean now if you enjoyed this blast from the past be sure to like it and click the subscribe button as well as the notification bell to be alerted when i post a

7RehGDWgZAc.json;- Hey everybody. I'm Bobby here on my. mom's YouTube channel. And today I'm gonna show you a very easy blueberry skillet cake. This is lots of fun. I love to cook in cast iron and I love. using simple ingredients. And one of those simple. ingredients is canned biscuits. These are great, and they're fun because sometimes they scare the mess out of you when you open 'em they. pop and they're really loud. But let's start this. cake by making a strudel. So walk over here with me to my mom's bakery or baking pantry. She's got a great little. food processor here and our strudel is going to be. just a few simple items here: butter, sugar, flour, almonds,. and a little bit of cinnamon. So combine all these ingredients. into the food processor. This is a small food processor. Very cute. Alrighty. Here we go. And I want this to be kind. of chunky, a little crumbly. Yeah, that's looking good. a little bit more maybe. Hey y'all. All right, that looks perfect. See if you can get a look at it. Beautiful strudel, and. we'll put this right on top. Okay. So back to the stove top and in our skillet, just gonna turn the stove on medium-low, and we'll start with some butter, and a little brown sugar, and it won't take long before. these things get going. For anybody who has never. cooked in cast iron, they're so wonderful and so versatile. And we've got a couple that I. think my brother has got one of my great grandma. Paul's cast iron skillet at his house that is golly, that thing's well over. a hundred years old. They become so well seasoned, and it's just a great tool for all kinds of all kinds of cooking. You can use 'em on the grill. You can do 'em in the oven obviously. Or you can just cook right. on top of your stove. So we're gonna get this butter. and sugar melted together. And while that's happening, let's go ahead and open up our canned biscuits here. Oh, thank you so much, my strudel. - [Woman] You're welcome. Spoon. See if we can, there's the pop. Canned biscuits are just fine by me. All right. Brown sugar and butter, that's a good base for anything. Great, that's melted. And so now I'm just gonna. arrange our biscuits in the skillet and you can see what's happening here. You know where we're going with this. I'm gonna have to do a little arranging to make this perfect. But it's not overcrowded, which is good. And voilà, look at that. Ooh, this is going to be good. So good. Okay. On top of that we'll just go ahead and set our blueberries. Look at these big plump blueberries. I love them. My kids love blueberries. My wife loves 'em, I I've got a, I've got one, One of my daughters Olivia will just eat any berry. Like raspberries, she. wants the whole container. She'll sit and just eat the. whole container of raspberries, do the same thing with blueberries. All the tomatoes, we've got a beautiful garden. with some fresh tomatoes. She'll just eat all the. tomatoes right off the vine, makes me pretty happy, really. These are, we might have. more than enough blueberries. - [Woman] Do you have enough, Bobby? - More than enough. Now you could use blackberries, you could use raspberries,. you know, no rules. So whatever you like you could use. And now to that, we'll. just add our strudel that we made, right on top. Just kind of crumble it up and remember that's got the butter in it and the almonds. That butter's gonna melt right on top and just be so nice with. the sugar and the flour. This is going to taste so good. And this is taking me about. five minutes to prep this. It's super simple and it's gonna cook really quickly too. This will be a nice dessert or breakfast with a cup of coffee or hot tea or cider. It's a very fall recipe, very fall. (timer rings) Something's ready. I'll bet this is gonna. go fast in this house, I know once Michael gets whiff of it. Okay. That's it, into the oven. Into the oven for about 30 minutes. Yep. 375 for about 30 minutes. So let's go pop this cast. iron skillet in the oven. Okay. Everybody, our blueberry. skillet cake is out the oven. This cooked at 350 for about 30 minutes. We made a, a really. simple strudel with nuts and with butter and flour and sugar, a little bit of cinnamon. We used canned biscuits and. a bunch of fresh blueberries and this thing looks and smells amazing. So if you wanna do a nice skillet recipe for your next gathering or. for a really good dessert for your family, this one fits the bill.;['postres']
9e3vaNiXUeo.json;hey y'all hey friends welcome to my kitchen today I'm telling you what this is one of those retro recipes made this everyday young every day of my life from 1989 having 1993 a poll I mean every day because this was such a popular dish on the bag lady I would do a beautiful fruit salad with I sometimes we can't champagne grape before in season those little tiny grapes I put a cluster that and of course a piece of star fruit beautiful strawberries and cantaloupe they were beautiful and I couldn't make enough to send out on our rounds in fact people would call in and say call me a fruit salad and it wasn't it the fruit was that great of course during the summer it really was wonderful but it was the French cream that they got on the side that made it so good so I'm gonna share this recipe with y'all I also make a French custard which a custard to me means cooked you know make one that you could but this is one that you just mix up and no cooking involved and it is wonderful I love to do fruit trays and cut my pineapple in half leaving the top on it too and scoop it out and fill it full of the French cream and it's just not only beautiful but delicious all right so I'm gonna start y'all by I'm not gonna start doing I think I'm gonna start whipping up my whipping cream and now this is the heavy cream y'all don't use half and half because half-and-half won't won't mix you got to have heavy cream 2 1 cup of heavy cream I use 1/4 of a cup of sugar to it and to me that makes it nice and sweet so we're just gonna beat this until it forms soft peaks okay we're back y'all and our whipping cream has been whipped until it forms soft peaks and Eddie just told me he said you might want to say fresh cream he and he said it sounded like I said fresh cream and I was saying French cream so I don't know what party is talking about where I was using that but it's French cream yeah I'm not fresh cream only this is kind of fresh cream but so anyway we've got our our whipped cream and now we're gonna mix together a softened cream cheese and I'm just gonna beat this actually I'm gonna mix this in a little bit bigger bowl because we've got some powdered sugar we got to add to that all right so I'm just gonna this is nice and soft and now we're gonna add our powdered sugar and just whip those two ingredients together until they're kind of creamy oh man I live is this so good there's a lotta Lotta creams out there for your fruit trays [Applause] all right so now I'm gonna add the juice of one lemon and we're gonna add some lemon zest and I don't know if you have one of these zester's but I couldn't do it I couldn't this addition is that's for you huh I know I know Teresa has already zested me some but I just wanted to show y'all what you need just when you have to zest an orange or a lemon you gotta have one these loans Esther all right so I'm gonna beat that a little bit incorporate that now now we're gonna add these two together we're gonna fold that in to our whipped cream oh my goodness I could stay on a fruit diet with this young alright so we just done a foul foul foul now I'm gonna add our lemon zest and I don't add my cysts while I'm squeezing my hand mixer because it seems like the zest just all winds up kind of wanted around your beaters and you lose a lot so I just stir my zest in at the last minute and I did test a little bit over here so we'll get that out too and the last thing we're going to add if you don't line in the restaurant says pineapple juice pineapple juice is great but you know what if you've got orange juice around and open that will work well too and so I'm just gonna get this to the consistency that I want by adding some sort of juice I wouldn't recommend tomato juice like we gel Ranger pineapple is really great all right so it just depends on how thin or how thick you want this and I think that that was what maybe a tablespoon of orange juice young and to me this is a nice consistency and if you don't have a lemon you could use orange zest mmm look how pretty that is get flavoring bit off this beater and it keeps staying okay are these you know what in that Adi on there I bought these at a yard sale or somewhere and I gave it to bobbing cloud I said look it's gonna do it and um I think I'm luck later I got him back they said mama we don't use things like that so here you go I got it back so you know when you're giving you chillin gifts you need to give them something and that you'd like to have because there's a good chance it's gonna come back home to you okay don't what a story I'm gonna be sitting there with the whole bowl this is awesome and look I do more cream than fruit [Music] I do hope y'all enjoy I think I like the zest of two lemons and more lemonade look there so pick you up some fresh fruit young because it's starting to come in pretty good now especially if you live down south and make you up some of this French cream people don't do that genius you;['postres']
9pgiZcgKrtE.json;- So y'all know how I'm always making those gooey butter cakes. Well, I'm going to. share a recipe with you. We are going to make. gooey butter cake balls, and we're going to form them. into cookies and you won't believe how good they are. So just like the original. gooey butter cake, this is so easy. I've got a stick of butter, it's been softening at room temperature. I've got an eight ounce. package of cream cheese, that's at room temperature. Come on out of that baby. I'll be right back. I just need a knife to get all eight ounces on my cream cheese. Okay. So we're going to beat. this until it's smooth (whisking machine engine) and then we'll add our egg and incorporate that real well, And then we'll add our cake mix. And you'll wanna make. sure that those two items are at room temperature,. because it would be very, very hard to beat if it wasn't. So now we're gonna add our one egg (whisking machine engine) Oh, that's good and smooth. So. the next thing is. going to be our cake mix, And I think there's a couple. of different flavors of chocolate out there in. pre-made, pre-packaged cakes, like a chocolate and then. maybe a Devil's Food. - [Theresa] That's a Devils Food - Okay, this is a Devils. Food, So it's going to be real chocolaty. - [Theresa] There's. also like double fudge. - Yeah (whisking machine noise) Okay, now I'm going to add the other half, just makes it a little bit easier y'all, not dumping the whole bag in at one time. (whisking machine noise) Alright. I want to stop a second and just bring everything down to the center of our bowl so it can all get mixed up. (whisking machine noise) All right, I swung that. off the best that could. Now at this point, it tells you to put it. in your refrigerator and chill it for two hours, because we're going to roll. our cookies into balls. So two hours, but you're not going to. have to wait two hours because Ms. Theresa is. so damn good at her job, - [Theresa] And it was such a. hard dough to make (laughter) - Ain't it hard. And I'll divide this up. among my grandchildren and let them make their own cookies, how about that. All right let me wash my hands, because I done been licking my fingers. So we're going to bake these y'all, on a, ungreased cookie sheet. And you want to just,. oh, I'm sorry Theresa. - [Theresa] No I'm just going to move some of this out of your way. - Okay, make room for a cookie sheet. - [Theresa] Absolutely, the most important. - So you'll want to scoop. up like a tablespoon of batter, and you can see. - [Theresa] Do you want. a big one or small one? - I think a big one. Teresa if you want to help. me, that would be great. - Okay - You know, it's. - [Theresa] Let me wash my hands. - It says not to grease it, so, you know, I just. like greasing my stuff. This is a messy job - [Theresa] How about we roll. them then we'll come back. - Yeah, that's good. Its boring watching me rolling. - So we're rolling them in powdered sugar, and after each one, I wash my hands. - I washed mine too, And I'm going to need to. wash them one more time or that may take two more times. - Yeah, that might. - You got the clean job. (laughter) Okay y'all, now everybody that knows me knows that I'm a nut lover. So this little sheet is. mine, I put nuts in it, but you know, you can put. whatever is your favorite thing. These are all plain so I. don't have to worry about, you know, the little children. So we're going to put things. in the oven, a 350 degree oven, and we're going to bake. them for 12 minutes. Then we're going to bring them out, and we'll probably sprinkle. them with just a little bit more powdered sugar. So y'all, they turned out so pretty and I'm just sifting a little powdered sugar on top of them, which, I mean, that's not even necessary. I'm so glad I sprayed my pans. So it's not necessary because they looked so crinkled and so pretty, but, a little bit more sugar. won't hurt anything, will it. So these will remain, soft and gooey in the center, just like a gooey butter cake, but you do want to let them cool and I'm going to be delivering these to grandchildren, in just a few minutes. - [Theresa] And they're. going to be thrilled to see granny.. - As soon as they cool. Yes. Out here on my island ill deliver Yum, yum yum. (laughs) Was so, so easy. If you love the gooey butter. cake, this is your recipe. With love.;['postres']

9tuCtK88mMU.json;- It's that time of year, y'all. I sent out a message to y'all, please send me your favorite cookie, Christmas cookie recipe, and y'all did. And for that, I thank y'all so, so much. Well, I got a recipe that. sounds absolutely so good, it's not your standard, you. know, drop cookie, y'all, it was sent to me from Elisa Dannik. But the name of it is Oma's Cookie Jar. And I'm assuming that that's Oma. I'm not sure, I'm not sure. They didn't write a note or anything, they just sent the recipe. - [Theresa] Well, that could. be Elisha, if Elisha is- - Yeah, it could be Elisha. Mm, she said, that smell. from the kitchen is magical. So I am making her praline shortbread. That's what it's gonna. look like, with any luck. Doesn't that look delicious? Like I said, not your typical drop cookie. So I am going to start, I'm gonna start, let's see,. we've got some coffee grounds and it is, let me see how much. - [Theresa] That's a tablespoon. - A tablespoon of coffee grounds. - [Theresa] And I'm gonna add. a teaspoon of hot water to it and let it sit once. - Yes, that's good, that's good. And you can get the hot water. right out of the, mm-hmm, and it'll be so hot. So we gonna let that sit. for a couple of minutes, and then we're gonna. discard the grounds on that. But to start the cookie, I'm gonna cream one stick of butter. I think it's a tablespoon, two tablespoons of creamy peanut butter. And then I'm gonna be adding. our sugar and our vanilla. And then to that, I'm. gonna be adding cornstarch, that's 2/3 of a cup and, no, that's our flour, 1 2/3 cup, and then our cornstarch,. which is 2/3 of a cup. So let me get started. Elisha. I wish I knew who I was talking to. Oma or Elisha. Anyway, I thank you. So we're just gonna mix that together until it's kind of creamy. Okay, we've got that creamed together. Now I'm gonna add my sugar or Oma's sugar. And I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla. Ooh, I'm about out, so. we'll just do it all, how about that? (laughs) better safe than sorry. Cornstarch. Flour. Mix. (chuckles) I think it's time to drain our coffee, and it didn't, it sure. didn't produce much liquid at all, but hopefully the coffee flavor, hopefully we've got enough. of the coffee flavor. I can't remember how. long Elisha said to, to. - [Theresa] Around four minutes. - Okay. Maybe it was that long. Anyway, not a bunch of liquid, but hopefully it's enough to. give it a good coffee flavor. I wanna go back over her recipe and make sure I hadn't left anything out, because this looks awfully, awfully (chuckles), doesn't. look like cookie dough, y'all, so let me just make sure. All right, I had a tablespoon, that was supposed to be. a tablespoon of coffee. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm, it was. - Yeah, and a teaspoon of,. mixed together, and set aside. Eight tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of peanut butter, half a cup of sugar,. 2/3 cup of cornstarch, 1 2/3 cup of flour, and. one teaspoon of vanilla. And then add the flour and blend well. Line a nine-inch square pan. with parchment and then spray. Press cookie mixture into the pan. Then dock it, I've never. heard of that expression, and in parentheses, use. a fork to punch holes all over the top of the dough. It, um... - [Theresa] What would. you like to add more to? I can tell you need, is it butter? - Well, I don't know, I don't know. I've never seen a cookie. dough quite so dry. Okay, it's more like a dough now. So I'm just gonna keep on using my hands, the warmth of my hands hopefully will break down the butter. Okay. So I just wanted to double check, y'all. So I put everything that. Oma says to put in it. So now I'm gonna spray my parchment paper. And I don't know why she recommended that, but I'm sure it will, time. will tell us why she did it. All right, she said to. just press our dough. Have y'all ever heard of. the description to dock it? - [Theresa] I have not. - [Paula] Have you heard of that Eddie? - [Eddie] No. - [Paula] And that sounds northern to me. - [Theresa] I know,. and it does to me, too. - [Paula] I don't know why that even... Where is Elisha from? - [Theresa] She didn't tell us a whole lot.. - Is she? - Maybe she'll send us-. - I think she... - Hopefully after this. airs, she'll send us some more info.. - Elisha, girl, you wasn't talking, honey. - [Theresa] But that recipe talked to me. - Uh-huh. Let me bring this thing. down where it's not so high. Okay. So we are gonna put a. topping on this, y'all. After this cooks, we're gonna let it, let it cool completely, and then we're gonna put a. praline topping on top of it, and that's really gonna. moisten this cookie, this bar cookie up, and. send us into hog heaven. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. I love to know what. other people are doing, so I so appreciate y'all sharing your recipes with me, and. the rest of the world, because your favorite cookie recipe might just become ours as well. All right. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna, I'm gonna. put just a little butter on my hands and see if that will help me stick it out. Okay. Now we're gonna put this in. - [Theresa] I'll get that for you. - A preheated oven, thank you, thank you. The more I touch, the more it... Let's see, did you grab. the recipe, Theresa? - [Theresa] I did, it's. 350 and it says 20 minutes. - So it's time to finish off. our praline shortbread cookies. And these are the ones that's gonna be cut into bar shapes, y'all. And you can see, you. remember how stiff that was, and I really had to press hard. It reminds me of lemon bars. You know, how you really have to press that crust down in there? This was kind of the same way. So we got to finish those off, and to do that, I'm gonna need. a stick and a half of butter. And I ran out of pecans, y'all. So the first half a cup is pecans, and the top half is walnuts. A nut is a nut is a nut. So... Elisha Davis, no, Elisha Dannik sent this recipe in to all of us, and she. calls it Oma's recipe. And she said to put the. butter and the sugar and the syrup into a saucepan. and bring it to a boil, and then turn down to a simmer and simmer for five minutes, stirring very often. Remove from heat and then. stir in the nuts, y'all. And pour over the top of the. completely cooled cookie. Okay, so let's go. I'm gonna drop milk in this. And I need some white syrup. So I'm gonna spray this, so. the syrup will come out of my, my spoon, so it'll just roll out. And. This stuff is pouring like syrup. - [Theresa] Imagine that.. - Slow. Slow. All right, that's one. I used to love this kind of syrup on my pancakes and waffles- - [Theresa] Really?. - when I was a little girl, yeah. - [Theresa] Ooh, that's really sweet. - Uh-huh. That's how I turned out so sweet. - [Theresa] Hm. (Paula laughs) - Did you get Theresa's. face on that one, Eddie? I don't think she believes me. - [Theresa] Of course we do. - All right, so we're. gonna bring this to a boil and stir it often for about five minutes. Then we're gonna add those nuts, and then we're gonna pour this over that incredible shortbread crust. Y'all, it's been simmering. for five minutes. And I know it didn't call for vanilla, but you know, it's just hard for me not to use vanilla, so. you don't have to do it. All right, we're just half nuts today, half pecans, half walnuts. And so we're gonna stir those in. And we're gonna pour this on. top of our shortbread cookies. - [Theresa] Now the recipe. asks for strictly pecans, but we like walnuts, so that's another change. - It doesn't matter. - that we made.. - Yeah, I love, yes, I love a walnut. Love, love, love walnut,. and of course, pecans, you know, that mean, that's Georgia's pecan. capital of the world. So... All right, we're gonna just take this and pour this on top. - [Theresa] Oh Lord. - [Paula] You gotta love it. - How come it's making. - 12 days of - us wait?. - Christmas cookies. Huh? - [Theresa] They keep making us wait, 'cause now we have to wait till it cools. - [Paula] I know. So it's gonna be a good while. It's gonna be a good while. before this puppy's cool. And she says to spread it out evenly over your shortbread cookie. Wow! Yeah, Theresa, I bet you'll. be gone by the time I- - [Theresa] I will be,. but I'll be back tomorrow. - [Paula] (laughs) By the. time I had this cool enough for us to sample. Look, look at that, see, it's. already starting to get hard. - [Theresa] Love it. - That praline. And those are the same. ingredients that I start putting in the pot for when I. make my pralines from scratch. Elisha, I have been waiting patiently for this to cool, and they look fabulous. So I'm gonna do just as you said do, I'm gonna cut them in finger shapes. Look at that. Whoa! And so I'm cutting them. I'm trying to cut them like an inch (chuckles) by fat. - [Eddie] Looks good. - Elisha, they look wonderful. Oma's Praline Creamcheese Praline Cookies. - [Eddie] Praline shortbread. - Mm-hmm, praline. shortbread, that's right. - [Eddie] No cream cheese. - No cream. (chuckles) Wow! Elisha, I've never had anything like it. But I will make this again. It's out of this world. The praline topping is wonderful. I might cut them almost in. little squares like that, because that praline topping is rich. You know, and I love rich men and rich food. (chuckles) I'm kidding about the rich men. Never ran up on a rich one. Mm, mm. It is so good, it doesn't. look at Christmasy as you know, some of the cookies that we tend to kind of decorate just before Christmas, but. what a wonderful addition this would make to your, along with your typical Christmas cookies. Thank you so much Elisha for sending it. Y'all must try. Eddie, you ready to try? - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. (Paula laughs);['postres']

a8H3eAgJ9N4.json;hey y'all I'm Paula Deen and you know in my humble opinion you can never have too much of a good thing and in this case that means dessert today I'm gonna be fixing few confections that are just a perfect ending to any meal first up is a decadent Charlotte Russe and then it's owned my we go eat off a butter cake and finally my sweet Southwest Georgia pound cake where nobody does it better so stick around y'all cuz today is like a dessert dream come true you Charlotte Russe it's an old old desert that's been around for years and years and years it's very much like a trifle now I'm gonna put 1/4 of a cup of milk in my saucepan and while that's just warming up I've got some water here and I've got a plain gelatin here and we're going to just sprinkle that gelatin into that water and I'm gonna let that bloom we're gonna take this off and I'm gonna add my gelatin to the milk and give that a stir and it's already thickening up that milk alright I've got that dissolved and I'm just gonna sit that over here and then we're going to move on over here to our egg whites and these eggs are at room temperature you always want to start with room-temperature eggs they just work better alright so we're just gonna dump our whites into here and then you'll want to save your yolks for another dish okay and this is our last egg all right and I'm gonna put these aside and save these for another recipe alright now we're going to beat these until they form stiff but not dry Pete alright that looks like nice still geeks alright I'm gonna move this to the side and bring in this other bowl and in this bowl I'm gonna beat two cups of heavy whipping cream and I'm gonna add a cup of granulated white sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm gonna beat this until it forms stiff peaks also and then I'm gonna fold these two things together along with our milk and our gelatin and our water [Music] all right let me move this out of the way what we're gonna do now is we're going to fold in our sweetens whipped cream into our egg whites and while that's gelatin dissolving I'm gonna go ahead and start folding these two things together and when you fold you want to go under and over so to make sure that we milk it's not too hot I'm gonna pour it back into this cold bowl and that will cheer it back down and that's fine it's just it almost feels like the temperature of my body so I'm just gonna drizzle that through here and then fold it in with the other ingredients it's gonna make a wonderful gooey sweet Center fine Charlotte Russe all right now we're going to make a mold out of this Charlotte Russe well I'm gonna use just a glass pyrex dish and I'm gonna start with ladyfingers and I'm putting about three across the bottom and then I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna stand up these ladyfingers around the bowl and you want to make sure that you fill in all the gaps because we're gonna unmold this onto a dish all right now I've gotten some sweet sherry and I'm just gonna take our sherry and we're gonna come in here and I'm gonna brush our ladyfingers with the sherry all right and now I've gotten some wonderful strawberry preserves these are store-bought now I'm gonna put a layer of the strawberry preserves down there and you can see how that's coming along now I'm gonna move over here and get our cream filling and I'm just gonna fill up the middle of these ladyfingers mmm and then I'm gonna top it with some more ladyfingers and if I have to I'll break some pieces to just finish that all right I've got it all covered with ladyfingers now and I've got a little bit more sherry left so I'm going to take that last little bit and just dab on top and now I'm going to take a plastic wrap and I'm gonna seal this up real good and I'm gonna stick it in the refrigerator for four to six hours because I want this chilled very very good and when we come back y'all I'm combining two of my most favorite things in the whole world a gooey butter cake and toffee chips so don't go away gooey butter cake [Music] we're back and before we get on to that gooey butter cake that I was talking about before break I want to go ahead and unwrap our roots because I had one that's been in the refrigerator now for about four hours and I'm gonna go ahead and unmold this and I'm gonna slowly tilt it and let the air get up in there now I had some filling leftover and I'm gonna dress this with just a little of our filling and I've got some raspberries and strawberries I'm just gonna drop some fruit around it I'm gonna come in here and fan me out a berry and put in the center of that mmm that looks just delicious and I'm gonna sip that over there now y'all have seen me make gooey butter cakes several times on the show I think kind of all the gooey butter cakes just the basic recipe may very well be my favorite and then I'm adding chocolate toffee bits and you can find these in your baking section these are just yummy so I'm gonna start with the base try gooey butter cake I've got a stick of butter melted here I've got a yellow cake mix here I'm gonna add one egg and one stick of melted butter now while I'm mixing up this I'm gonna go ahead and add another stick of butter so that's gonna melt and we're gonna mix this up and this batter is gonna be real real thick all right I've got our crust in one egg and one stick of melted butter blended together here but because I'm cooking outside and using my little mini oven a 13 by 9 by 2 wouldn't fit in this oven so I'm doing it in 2 8 by 8 pans all I'm gonna do is divide our batter up half in one pan and half in the other and we're just going to press this into our pan now we're going to come over here and we're going to make the filling to our gooey butter cake and I'm going to use the same bowl I don't have to wash it it's not going to affect the center of our our gooey I'm going to start with an 8 ounce package of cream cheese that's been softened to room temperature I'm going to add two eggs a teaspoon of vanilla another stick of melted butter get every drop out and one 16 ounce box of powdered sugar now we're just gonna beat this up until it's smooth alright and now we're going to add our toffee bits to this I'm just gonna fold those in now you can get toffee bits two ways you can get the plain toffee bits or you can get toffee bits with chocolate now I'm gonna divide this Center into both of these pans and I'm just spreading this out alright I like a little sprinkled on top so when it bakes you can see that it's not just a regular gooey butter cake so I'm gonna take a few and just put on top like that now I'm gonna put these in the oven it's been preheated to 350 degrees and because of the sizes of these pans I'm gonna just watch that I'm gonna keep checking on them periodically after like 30 minutes so I think I've waited long enough I'm gonna come in here and cut me a piece oh that looks good you can see those strawberry preserves I just love the way this looks it's got the different textures and they're the creamed Center and the strength that the ladyfingers give it the next thing up is the southwest Georgia pound cake I'll see y'all back in a minute [Music] our duty butter cakes turned out really really good it's amazing how well these little ovens or bake these gooey butter cakes look delicious too sometimes I'll use these to put in the center of Baked Alaska so I'm gonna try to resist tasting it and just keep those piled up there they look scrumptious alright let's talk about pound cakes this is one of the favorite pound cakes of the folks that live in southwest Georgia where I was born I was born in Albany Georgia and a lot of people over there make these cakes and I'm gonna start with two sticks of real butter at room temperature now I'm gonna add three cups of sugar and I'm gonna beat these together until they're nice and creamy all right now I'm gonna add the eggs all right that's nice and creamy now all right now I've got three cups of all-purpose flour and I have a half a teaspoon of baking powder and I'm going to give those this quick stiff together and that was baking powder now not soda all right now we're going to add our dry ingredients to our creamed mixture we're going to start with flour and end with flour if we started with heavy cream and ended with green it would almost make our batter look like it had broken I'm gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla [Music] all right now I'm gonna take a bundt cake pan and I'm gonna spray it cuz you want to make sure that your pound cakes always come out and don't leave chunks in the pan and I'm gonna just this with a little flour we're just gonna pour our batter around and we're gonna start this cake off now in a cold oven and we're gonna bake it for an hour in 15 minutes and you'll want to just take your spatula and level out your cake like that now like I said we're not gonna turn our oven own until we put our cake in the oven when we put the cake in the oven we're going to turn it to 325 by an hour and 15 minutes and it's going to be so light and rich and dense at the same time I think the cook is earned the right to taste a gooey butter cake so let's see how they turned out they look yummy you can see the toffee nut and the chocolate in the gooey part of that mmm it's unbelievably rich while our cakes baking I'm gonna clean up and when we come back I'm gonna show y'all ways that you can take that ordinary pound cake and really dress them up so I'll see y'all back in a minute [Music] I was telling y'all earlier that southerners love their pound cake but we also love doing different things with it like our toast buttering it and frying it up in the black skillet whether it's just long the things that you can do with a pound cake besides just eating it straight up personally I love my Strawberry Shortcake made with fresh pound cake you know you can get the little the little cups in the grocery store that have the indented Center and that's what my momma used to use a lot of times and they were perfectly yummy but nothing absolutely nothing takes the place of real Shortcake so I'm gonna take our cake and I'm gonna just pour fresh strawberries and that juice over it we really get get that juice all over it to soak into that piece of cake and then I'm gonna top it with fresh whipped cream and you've got the best strawberry shortcake you've ever put in your mouth and another flavoring that I really really love is the flavor of lemon curd I just love it now you can make your own lemon curd or you can do as I've done today and just use a store-bought I'm just gonna let that lemon curd just drip all over that piece of pound cake and then I'm gonna top him with just a little fresh zest these are just a couple of my favorite ways and I'm sure once you make that pound cake that you're going to come up with plenty of other ways yourself well did y'all enjoy today's show I hope that you did because you know there's just nothing better than just a whole bunch of desserts the southwest Georgia whipping cream pound cake is so unbelievably dense and rich and delicious and the gooey butter cakes I swear to Peter I didn't think I could improve them but I think that the toffee bits just really take it over the top and the Charlotte Russe oh it's just delicious it's an old timey dessert that we can still enjoy today I hope y'all love all the recipes and as usual America I want to send you loving best dishes from my kitchen to yours you;['postres']

And today we're getting. into the holiday spirit. This is a cinnamon scented pound cake. We love pound cakes around here. My grandmother Paula made the. best pound cake I've ever had. My mom makes it, makes it,. I sit over here one day and ate all the crust off the top. Not when I was five, when I was 55. This happened a couple. months ago, Mama was mad. So today we're gonna. make our own pound cake and I can eat the entire top if I want to. Let's get going. We're using. a little bitty baking pan. Yeah, I'm gonna spray with some non-stick (spraying) and then we're gonna line it with a piece of parchment paper too. We really don't want this to get stuck. (spraying) I'm not gonna force that. down. We'll get to it. The first thing I'm gonna do in this bowl is I'm gonna cream our. butter along with our sugar. So today we have a brown. sugar and a granulated sugar and I'm gonna give it a really good mix. Eventually. Hey! You know sometimes I just. don't know which button to push and sometimes Teresa doesn't. plug the appliances in. (laughter) - [Teresa] And I didn't. (laughter) - This is a great start to the show today. Kind of like Christmas, you never know what's going to happen. But it all works out in the end. Boy, I'm glad I didn't have. that too close to my face. All right, so I'm gonna cream our butter with our brown sugar. (buzzing) This is one of those recipes. where you're gonna need two bowls 'cause we're. doing dry into the wet and you know, it's a whole system. You gotta make sure that you start with dry and end with dry. First bowl though, butters and sugar. Okay, I've got this beaten up. So what I'm gonna try to do is add one little egg at a time to this. (buzzing) Let's see. This recipe takes a few. minutes to put together but it's only 45 minutes in the oven. So, you know, baking. is not really my thing but when it's holiday. season, I think it's our responsibility to kind. of make baking our thing. Everybody's looking for. something sweet at Christmas time and a cinnamon pound cake,. boy that really fits the bill. So we got our eggs beating in here We wanna make sure this. is light and fluffy, but I don't want to overmix it. And now we're going into our other bowl and what we have here y'all is we've got our flour, we've got some baking powder, some salt, and then this is our. little scent of cinnamon. Mix this up. I'm gonna be covered with flour. Okay, I think now actually. we need a third bowl. Let me see if I can grab. one right here real quick. What they'd like for us to. do now is we're gonna combine our three things together. Here, here and here. So we're gonna combine,. you start with the dry, you're gonna add a little bit of flour, and then we're gonna add a. little bit of our mixture here, (buzzing) then add the wet. And then we go milk. (buzzing) A little bit here. Little bit here. We just wanna make sure and get all this incorporated correctly. And so what I'm gonna do here y'all is I'm gonna alternate adding these two wet ingredients to our dry bowl here. I started with dry and. you just wanna make sure that the last ingredient that we drop in here is gonna be dry as well. It'll take me one second. and we'll be baking. All right y'all looky there. Now we're gonna go onto our parchment into our pan right here. I just blindly grabbed. a tool from behind me and I did not get the best scraper tool but it is a nice tool. - [Teresa] There's one in that. drawer right in front of you. If you would like to - [Jamie] Let's make sure. I get this evened out, press it down. I want a rubber spatula for this bowl. Make sure I get every bit of it 'cause mama's not here. but mama's always here. And if she walked in there and saw me not putting this in there, I wouldn't get to eat any pound cake. Mama's traveling this. week, she's always so busy and I miss mom, but I. really enjoy coming in here and sharing recipes with y'all. I asked that you check. out my Instagram account, see if there was any food on there that you wanted me to cook, and I've had some people jump on and followed 'em for checking. it out this week so, if you see something on the Instagram and you want me to cook. it, we're always looking, well Theresa's always. looking for recipe ideas. And I'm always happy to cook. Look, this looks, eh, I'd give it a eight out of 10 but it's gonna be delicious. Y'all stick around we're. gonna go 45 minutes into the oven and our barely there cinnamon pound cake will be ready. See you in a bit. Hey y'all we got our cinnamon. pound cake out of the oven. I don't know how it tastes, but it looks beautiful. Isn't that so pretty? Now you could tell that this is homemade. And look at the crust on here, ooh. That's what I ate, Mama got so mad at me. See if I move this over. Wow, that turned out perfect. So now you can go out to the yard and get you some green clippings. If you got a holly tree at your house you could put some holly around this. You could put a couple. Christmas ornaments around it. It is really a beautiful cake. It only took a little bit. of mixing and 40 minutes. Let it cool at your house but, I'm paid to eat around here,. so I'm gonna give it a try. Probably gonna be too hot and crumbly. - [Teresa] We have no patience. when it comes to tasting. - Well, we've got a job to do and this is not gonna be too hot. Look how moist and pretty. Boy, this turned out good. Now, if you wanted to,. you could reach in here and get you a little piece of piece of butter and put it on. your pound cake, that's good. Hmm hmm. This pound cake is not as good as my Granny Paula's pound cake. But it's as good as any. pound cake you can buy. I recommend that y'all. immediately put this on your Christmas list this year. Y'all put together this. cinnamon pound cake. It is delicious. I'm Jamie Deen This is good food. We'll see y'all around the kitchen.;['postres']
A_TVwXzmYoM.json;- We're working down those 12 days of Christmas cookies, y'all. And a viewer sent me a recipe. Her name is Heather Malcus She doesn't tell me where. she's from or anything but she has sent me a. thumbprint cookie to share with everybody. And I'm so excited about this because I hadn't made a thumbprint cookie I think since my boys were little. And Teresa is still on her cruise. So you won't hear her barking at us in background. saying lets get it now. (laughing) look at this we've got. precious little Casey. Casey, how long have you. been part of this family? - I started in 2005, so 18. - Oh my goodness. And she doesn't look but 19 years old. So you're probably thinking, Well you hired her while she. was still in diapers. Paula, (laughing) - She was young. She was young. You were straight outta. high school, weren't you? - Yeah, - I remember. So Casey has stepped. in to help pull all the ingredients together for us. So one of your jobs is. to talk to me too, Casey. Okay. Keep me straight, if you see me doing something wrong. Okay. Say whoa, Paula, stop right there. So , the thumbprint cookie we're gonna make the cookie base first, and then after our cookies come outta. the oven and, and Cool. Then we are gonna make the. thumbprint filling to it which is gonna be so good. Heather, it sounds like you. have made this cookie so simple which I know that's what I appreciate. And everybody out there there are no instructions. for putting this together. So we just going to do it. I'm gonna cream our butter and our sugar first, and then we have our flour we have our cocoa. powder, we have our salt. I'm gonna go ahead and add the salt to the cocoa powder right now because I'm wanna stir those. two ingredients together. So like I said, it's been years. Okay, so we got that mixed up. Now I'm gonna just add these two things together. Ouch. That's not much bigger. See what I say about underestimating, You know I got so many bowls this size. - Yeah. - I need to invest in this size - A few more without size - Huh? - Yeah - I, I mean, I can check. We may have some, - I've Got, Oh yeah, we may have some in the garage. - You, you sent a lot of. stuff out into that garage. - I know. Our garage looks like from all the years of shows and magazine shoots, there was so many dishes. It was unbelievable. All right, so I'm gonna just add this to our cream next year. And we got a little milk to go in it. (whisking) I'm gonna add a little milk. And help me get that mixed up. - Is this a sandwich type of cookie? - No. Uhuh. When we, we gonna roll them in sugar we gonna roll them first. in balls, then in sugar. and then we're gonna take our thumb and make our thumbprint. the center of the cookie and then that'll hold the filling part. - Oh, okay. Some people make them with. like a dollar of preserves you know, strawberry jam. or something like that. It's gonna be a stiff though. But (laughter) Heather's a girl after my old heart. This whole cookie recipe y'all has one pound of butter in it. Two sticks in the cookies,. and two sticks in the filling. I like Heather. Okay, the last of the milk is in there. And now I'm gonna add. the vanilla flavoring and I'm gonna add just a little. bit more because a teaspoon. Mm. (laughing) Can somebody open it? I'll hold it while you try to unscrew it. Eddie. Thank you. Oops. Maybe a table's spoon. - It'll balance some at the butter. - Yes. (laughing) This is some real thick batter. Heather has instructed us to roll dough into one inch balls. That's about a inch, isn't it? Or is that too much? Okay, I'll take a little ouch, y'all. Then we gonna roll it with sugar. See that? That's gonna be our thumbprint cookie. Casey called it to my attention, y'all I gave y'all bad directions. the first time around. We were supposed to roll these. in balls, roll 'them in sugar put 'them in the oven, and as they come out the oven. while they're still warm that's the point where. we make the indention. And I was thinking that we were supposed to. make the indention first. I told y'all it's been. years since I made them. So they're going in the oven at three 50 from 10 to 12 minutes. And when they come out we'll need to make that. indention pretty quickly before they start getting hard. And while they're baking,. I'm gonna go ahead and make our filling of that marshmallow cream filling that's gonna go in those holes. But we don't wanna fill them. until they're completely cool. All right. While our cookies are baking I'm gonna make the filling. and it's one seven ounce jar of marshmallow fluff right here. Two sticks of soften clutter half a teaspoon of vanilla right there. but I have decided I am gonna add almond extract to it. One to two tablespoons of milk, two and a fourth cup of powdered sugar and food coloring in case. you want to dye your filling. And since we do it for Christmas,. that might be kind of fun. You know what I love? I love marshmallow fluff. on top about ice cream. So good. If there is another way to. think, make things more fattening I might be you girl. - That's what we grew up with fluff and peanut butter sandwiches. - Really, fluff. And I bet it was delicious. - Fluff And nut. - Fluff and nutters. - Yeah, that's the thing. (laughter) I love that. I love that. I might have to just make me one one night when I'm on my way to bed. Just a little hungry. Make me a fluff and nutter, what you call it? - Yeah - Fluff and nutter. - You wanna fold that in? Paula? - Okie doke. Thank you. Thank you for keeping me straight Casey Was I supposed to put. the sugar in before I because I have no. instructions on my paper. - Yes - I was supposed to add the sugar first - Cream butter and sugar together - And then fold in the fluff. - Okay. - Now it looks like it. Little hair in the recipe, but yeah. And then fold in the marshmallow - Green. Okay. Are we gonna be doing it? Yes. 10 different this time, since we use the paddles it's not like it will beat it to death. And I'll make sure I do it on low teaspoon of almond. Cause almond is so good with chocolate - I can smell that. chocolate cooking right now. - Yeah. - Perfect - They look like crinkles. That's pretty the way they crack because we put the sugar on them. The sugar is what makes. 'them have that cracked look. So now these have to cool completely. So what I'm gonna do Casey I'm gonna pull that off like that Get 'them off the hot thing so they'll cool quicker. Don't, that's hot now. - Oh - Oh that's man overboard. Man overboard. Man overboard Maybe we need to eat that one. Eddie. Heather, thank you so much for sending us this recipe. It just really takes me back to when my boys were little boys and I think it's gonna be delicious. And it is It taste just like your. Grammy's inside out cake. - Yeah, the chocolate, chocolate cake. Yeah. The dough part tastes like fudge and the filling tastes like marshmallows, fluff. with almond and it, Ooh a big old half can would be so good. And thank you so much, Heather. Loving best dishes and Merry Christmas.;['postres']
Be7fw_NVJl4.json;- We would just talk about the surprise it was pulled on me last weekend y'all. I think my birthday, I. don't know what date it is, - [Theresa] The 19th, it was January... - I know it's January the. 19th, but I don't know what day that is.. (laughing) It's in a few days or. two days or something. - [Theresa] Yes, it's in two. days, it's on a Wednesday. - Anyway, Eddie came to me and told me that we're doing a family photo shoot this past Saturday. And I didn't think a thing. about it because we do update our photos every couple of years, especially with the children growing. So, I remember back there, Emily was here to do my hair. and makeup and she said, hi, you want to wear your hair, Paula? And I said, well, what's easier on you, to do it down and then. put it up other photos. And I noticed she didn't. get what I was saying. And we do things like this all the time. Finally, I just said, oh, just do it down. If it doesn't look good,. we'll put it up later. And I told Eddie when he was. telling me about this shoot, I said, I don't know if you've noticed, but I hadn't been asking. any questions about this. Because if Eddie tells. me, it's the solid truth. I can go to bed knowing. So.... - [Theresa] Now you know. - Yes, yes. So I was back in the bathroom and I was getting my shirt, I don't know, whatever I was doing, my earrings or something. And I said, it sounds like. a party in the kitchen, so I figured maybe all. the kids had gotten here. And I was hoping that. Michelle was going to be able to make it because her family. had been under the weather. Well, I walked in the kitchen, it was all the folks that. ain't got nothing to do with family photos.. (laughing) - [Eddie] Well, it was kind of a family, it was extended family, - Yeah, extended family, that the kind of family that you pick, because you love them.. - [Eddie] Yeah. - I am standing up here just nibbling on what I'm supposed to be fixing, but Aunt Peggy was here. and Bubbles and Feel. And so many of my friends couldn't come. Not that I have a bunch of friends. - [Theresa] Yes you do.. (laughing) COVID was really... - Yeah, lot of folks couldn't come, but the ones that were. here, appreciate them. But you know, I'm just. not too big on surprise birthday parties.. (laughing) - [Eddie] It was a was. a surprise hoist rose. So as an outdoor event. - I know. And Eddie said something about, he did say we are gonna be. doing a low country boil. No, we gonna be doing a. meal for this photo shoot. And I said, a meal? And he said, I said,. well, what are we doing? And he said, low country boil. - [Eddie] Technically, I did not fit. I mean, we did have hair and. makeup and someone was there taking photos and stuff.. (laughing) - [Theresa] And it was Michael's idea. - [Eddie] And it was Michael's idea. - [Theresa] So, Eddie, you were. only following instructions. - [Eddie] I was, I follow instructions. - Michael was... - [Theresa] But it's a milestone. It's a nice. I'm not gonna say it because... - It is a milestone. No, listen. I've earned every year I got. I have earned them. - [Theresa] So tell them what. age you'll turn in two days. - I'm 57. - [Theresa] You and I are the same age. - Are we?. - [Theresa] We are. - Well, I know it. involves those two numbers and I get confused y'all, is it 57 or 75? - [Theresa] I'm going with 57.. - Me too. - [Eddie] Oh, someone swapped. the candles in the cake. - [Theresa] Did they really? - When I saw those candles, I. turned them around to say 57. That was me.. (laughing) - [Theresa] They're only numbers. - [Eddie] Well, now, Aunt. Peggy up until the day before she came, was still thinking, I thought, because we started planning this back right after Thanksgiving, and... - Really? - [Eddie] Yes, - Gosh, Michael was on the ball, one got. - [Eddie] Aunt Peggy asked Susan, the night before they were coming, now, what should I wear. for this photo shoot? And Susan said, Aunt Peggy,. is not really a photo shoot. (laughing) - She had already forgotten what it was. Oh, I love my Aunt Peggy, so much... - [Theresa] She is 49. - Yeah. - [Eddie] Or 39. She's gonna be 39.. - [Theresa] 39. Sorry. I'm sorry.. (laughing) So, she called me yesterday, y'all. And we were trying to talk to each other and have a conversation. And neither one of us, we've all gotten, we've both gotten something forgetful, some of the easiest words. we can't get them out there. And she was saying, oh, I can't remember. And I'd say, oh, well so, and so, and so, but I can't remember either. So she finally said, hey old, I'm gonna hang up because I can't remember any of the words to my story.. (laughing) I said, I am with ya.. (laughing) I can't tell you my story either, because I'm forgetting half the words. Now this is one of those. recipes that you can do, like a warm bread. pudding or a cold trifle. So I'm doing a cold trifle today and I'm using a box of. instant vanilla pudding. And I've got two cups of heavy. cream that has been whipped. And we are gonna put a combination of cinnamon and sugar in. with the whipped topping. Yeah, this is real, real easy to make. And in this one, I'm gonna add, I've already poured in. the vanilla flavoring. I think I was talking. and didn't tell y'all, but I'm putting some brown sugar. And you can find this recipe. on the website, can't you? - [Theresa] Yes. Ma'am. And as always, it'll be. linked to this video. - Okay, good. All right. So I have put half of the. toasted cinnamon bread down, and now I'm gonna put the raisins in that I have soaked in a dark rum. All right. Now we've got our brown sugar and cinnamon whipped into our cream and. we've got our pudding over here that I added the brown. sugar and vanilla to. All right, so, gonna do spread this out. I can't get over how good, just have good that cinnamon bread is. - [Theresa] I know. You know, it was a buy one, get one, - Buy one, get one free. Well, how come we're. not making two of these? (laughing) - All right.. - [Theresa] You might need to. (laughing) - I know it, I've... - [Theresa] Don't forget the cream, don't forget the whipped cream. - Oh, I forgot. Thank you, Theresa. - [Theresa] We have a picture.. - I know we do. I have to get that pulled out.. - [Eddie] It's right in there. - It's right in there. It's hanging in that pantry. - [Theresa] when you finish this... - Okay. - [Theresa] Dish you might. have to go over there. - Okay.. (laughing) - [Theresa] It used to hang in. photo shoot, do you remember? - Yes. - It was sad losing my mother and daddy, was very sad for Bubba and me, but Aunt Peggy, sure, it was wonderful to have, that was, Aunt Peggy was my mama's sister. - [Theresa] Is she older or younger? - Aunt Peggy was two years younger. - [Theresa] Okay. - So that's all of that. And now I'm gonna put. the rest of our pudding. I think this could have stood another. - [Theresa] We could have. done the big box, the pudding. - Yes, I think so. Because the recipe called for four ounce and I don't think they seem. a such thing as a four ounce. It's like three and a half. So this is gonna be. really skimpy, Theresa. - [Theresa] Well, it's also just... - It's been so many years. - [Theresa] That trifle balls'. a little short and fat too. - Yeah. It's been so long since I've made these. - [Theresa] It's all. gonna eat good though. - Yeah. - [Theresa] I can see it. - Now, I'm gonna put. the rest of the raisins in little rum.. (laughing) This is gone. Spread it up a little bit, this cream. - [Eddie] I can smell the rum. - You can?. (laughing) - [Eddie] The rum and cinnamon. - [Theresa] You could probably. like add bananas to this too. Like, if you wanted to add... - There's so many things you. could do to this Theresa, but this does need to. sit in the refrigerator. But, next time I make it, I will increase the pudding. I think I would use three, I mean, two, three and. a half ounce puddings. Because I do like a lot of custard. - [Theresa] I'll make. that change on the recipe. - Yes, that would be wonderful. - [Theresa] And then that. way they'll have that. - Yeah. I don't wanna eat and try a trifle. And I mean, I'm gonna get every bit back that cream out of there. - [Eddie] Do we have some spiced. pecans left from Christmas? - I don't know if we do or not. I think I might've eaten them all. (laughing) Because there was some. sitting on that table and I think I might've got them into me. - [Theresa] Yeah, Eddie,. you missed our conversation about eating sweets at night. that they talked to us. - So this is gonna go in the refrigerator and let it sit and mellow out. - [Theresa] You've already. tasted all of it together though. (laughing) - It's good, y'all. Okay, so in the refrigerator it goes. You can see the pudding. I didn't separate the pudding, too good. I put too much on the ground floor. (laughing) There we go. I'm gonna cover it, put. it in the refrigerator and let it sit for 2, 3, 4 hours. And it's a nice dessert. I think I might sprinkle some more raisins and maybe some nuts on top and then make a nice, easy. dessert to serve to your friends and your family. So we'll come back and. we'll taste that later. All right. So, our raisin bed trifle has been in the refrigerator, just sitting in and merrying. all those ingredients together. Now I did sprinkle some. real finely chopped pecans and some more raisins on top. So, this is one of those dig deeps. Oh, Michael, I think. you're gonna love these. The cinnamon toast that I had been buying, I didn't use that particular brand, but, same thing. So, I made this trifle. - Thank you. - Out of cinnamon raisin bread. - It's good. - Oh, good, I'm glad you like it. I made it years ago, but,. I've probably forgotten. - [Michael] Looks fresh. I said it looks fresh. - It is fresh. I made it today. - [Michael] I thought. you made it years ago. (laughing) - That's right. It's good, ain't it? I like the raisins, those. are a nice addition. And, the toasted raisin bread is good in there. Cinnamon raisin. - Delicious. - I feel glad you walked in. the door just in time to... - I smelled something. - [Eddie] Have your. dessert before your dinner. (laughing) - I mean, Michael's nose is. as long as Aunt Eugene's nose. Because when I'm cooking something, it's like you walked in the door. Perfect timing. Delicious. Loving best dishes, y'all.;['postres']

And I want to give everybody. just a little background on how you and I met. You look pretty this morning. Well, anyway, I first met Terry, my first remembrance, 'cause. I meet a lot of people y'all, was at Lake Oconee, you know,. my best friend, Bubbles, Susan Green, we were. having a Bag Lady event, my charity, The Bag Lady. We will have an event at Lake Oconee and Susan, did Susan, oh no, no, no. That's the first time, I really, really really remember, but Terry tell everybody, or Teresa Ann. - My name is Paula Ann. So Theresa Ann, so tell. everybody how we first met. - Paula we first met in 2013. I was invited to a. Christmas cooking school at your lovely home in Savannah, and it was a dream come true. And so we drove from West. Virginia all the way down. There was about 40 of us attending the Christmas Cooking School. And I was just so excited. and got to meet you and got to spend time with you and at that event, one of the little competitions. you had for everyone was that they had to, we had to come up with. kind of like a competition baked idea, which had to be. made with crescent rolls. And the idea was that. we would make a wreath. And I decided I was going. to make a Santa Claus. And it was so funny because. everyone in the room could not figure out what. in the world I was doing. And I knew that if that was. only time I ever baked for you, then by golly, I was. going out with a bang. And I won. - [Paula] And you told me that. you felt a connection to me because you had, our. stories were so similar. - They absolutely are. and you know, I was sharing with you, I've told this story so many times, but sadly you and I share a connection in the fact that our parents. both died when we were younger. My mother died when I was 14. and my dad died 15 months later when I was 15. And we sadly share that, also you have two sons and. I have three of my own. And you were divorced and I was divorced and we have a lot of things in common. - As I said y'all,. today's show is all about Valentine's Day and showing your loved one how much you love them. And I'm here with Terry Blevins from her bakery, Little. Bits Of Heaven Cupcakes, but she does so much more y'all. So I've got a little tape. of Terry actually making her cocoa bombs. So we're gonna roll that for y'all and she made it look very, very easy. So here we go. - So we're going to. need a couple of things to get started with and. use what you can find. You can find hot cocoa molds online pretty much just about anywhere now. The size that we're using. today is a 70 millimeter hot cocoa bomb. So that's going to give. us a really nice sphere. It's going to just fit. into your coffee mug. And it's going to be big enough that you feel like you're doing. something really decadent. And of course you are. So to get started, I've got two that are each. six count of our sphere molds. These are made out of silicone. so they can handle the heat of the melted chocolate just fine. I've actually got some chocolate. that I have melted here. And what that is today,. I'm just using Almond Bark. Now you can use just about. anything that you want to, if you want to use a. higher grade of chocolate, we certainly do sometimes, you just have to temper it and tempering just means bringing it up to a certain temperature. letting it cool down, and then you get to use it again. The main reason why I decided. to use Almond Bark today is just because you don't. have to go through all that. It still tastes really nice. You can get it in white chocolate. You can get it in regular chocolate. Today, we're going to be. using regular chocolate and I've just cut it up into chunks. I put it in this Pyrex glass. bowl, put it in the microwave. I usually melt chocolate,. at kind of like half power. So 50%. if I'm doing a really big. bowl I might even do like eight minutes at 50% power and I'm stirring every. two or three minutes. And then you end up with this lovely just fabulous bowl of melted chocolate. So let's go ahead and get started. I have got my melted chocolate. and I've got a tablespoon. So as hot cocoa bombs. have become more popular, lots more ways to do this. And you certainly may have, you know, your own way of what you're. more comfortable with. That is perfectly fine. What I have found, however,. is that here in the bakery, we have several sets of measuring spoons and I use some for some. things and some for others, but this measuring spoon, we're going to be using. a tablespoon today, and this one is a cup. I mean, it really is, it's not. a flat, it's more of a cup. And what I've found is. that it's more similar to the actual cup, I don't know if you can. see that, of the mold. So it works really well. And so with our melted chocolate I'm gonna move this over a little bit. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to go through and we're going to add one. tablespoon of melted chocolate to each one of these molds. You don't have to worry about. doing anything with it yet. We can literally do six of these. And if your chocolate is melted enough, it's going to work just fine. So don't worry about that. So we're going to start, I am super messy, I don't know if you guys are. I try to be neat in the. kitchen, but oh my goodness, I'm dragging chocolate everywhere. So don't feel bad if you do. that, it's perfectly fine. Maybe y'all have somebody nice enough to clean up after you,. wouldn't that be fabulous? Okay, so I've got chocolate. in all six of my molds and here's what you're going to do. You're going to take the. bowl part of the tablespoon, and you're just going to. kind of press down in here and you're going to just. smooth that chocolate up on the sides. I don't know if you guys can see that. And so you're just going to go through. This is just the first coat. So we're going to do. two coats of chocolate. I've learned the hard way. If you don't do two coats, you go to try to pop that. thing out of the mold and guess what, jokes on you, it's not going to work out very well. So we're just kind of. gently moving the chocolate up the side. And you want to make sure guys that you are bringing your chocolate all the way up to this lip. That's going to be the weak. spot in your hot cocoa bomb so you want to make. sure that you're pulling that chocolate all the. way up to the sides. So we're going to pop this in the freezer and I'll be right back. And I'm back. And we've gotten the. first layer of chocolate in the show molds out of the freeze, only takes like five or six minutes. So it doesn't take long at all. So we're going to go back to our chocolate but this time we're going to. do it a little bit differently, because now there is a cold surface that we're applying chocolate to, which means that you can't do six and then try to go back to it. So these, I just do one at a time. And so that's what we're going to do. So we're going to start. with kind of a flat scoop of our tablespoon. We're going to pour it right in the center and then quickly we're going. to do the exact same motion over again. We are bringing that melted. chocolate up the wall, to the edge. And then we're going to. do the exact same thing with all of the others. You want to make sure that you have an even layer of. chocolate going up the sides because when you go to actually put the hot cocoa bomb together, if the chocolate isn't even, then you might just put. your finger through it. And we don't want you to do that. We are setting you up for success. Perfect. Okay, I'm going to pop. this in the freezer again, another five or six minutes and then we'll be ready to assemble our hot cocoa bombs. All right, so our second coating of. chocolate is now completely firm. And now comes the really fun part. My staff will tell you that this is a very satisfying process and they love when we're. making hot cocoa bombs and they get to help me unmold them. It seems kind of nerve wracking, but I promise you if you do. the two coats of chocolate, if you make sure that you've got it going up the sides evenly it's going to be just. fine, I promise you it is. So what you're going to do is you're going to take your mold. You're going to start at the edge and you're just going to kind. of pull the silicone away. And as you do that, you're. going to have your fingers underneath the cup right here. And you're just going. to pop it out like that. It's so simple. I have got a few different things here that I'm going to move over. I've got hot cocoa, I've got marshmallows, I've actually got chocolate chips. I've got little dehydrated. chocolate marshmallows. The first flavor that we're going to make is actually death by chocolate. We make death by chocolate cupcakes here and I just feel like if. you're going to go chocolate, you might as well just go all the way. So I don't want you to be. intimidated by this process. But there's a couple of things you want to make sure that you have. One of them is, I have a ceramic plate and that plate has actually. been heated in the microwave, just like this. So put it in the microwave, you're not trying to burn yourself. You just want this to be warm because this is what's going to help you create the seal that will hold. your hot cocoa bomb together. So I've put it in our. microwave for about 45 seconds. Our microwave is kind of. nuclear powered, it's crazy. So you might need a little bit longer. So what you're looking. for is just not hot enough to burn yourself, but just. warm all the way through. And that's what you're looking for. So use your microwave as you know best. So we're going to take one of our spheres. And as you can probably tell there's just a little rough. edge or anything on here. They're not perfect yet,. but they're going to be, and we're going to take. it and turn it upside down on our warm plate. And we're just going to start turning. And as we turn, the warmth of the plate is actually melting. that edge of chocolate, you don't have to push, just turn. And now we have this. beautiful melted edge. So this is what's going to help us create our beautiful hot cocoa bomb. Now you have to move kind of quickly. The biggest thing to remember is that you have to melt every edge, okay? So you can't just do the top. and then not do the bottom. You have to do all of them. We're using a heaping. tablespoon of ridiculously good hot cocoa. And I'm going to add that. directly into the shell that I just made. I'm going to add some. regular marshmallows. I'm going to add some dehydrated. chocolate marshmallows. I'm gonna add some chocolate chips. How full does this thing need to be? Ah, you know? You don't want it overflowing, but it's fine that it's coming. up a little bit over the cup. I actually have a bag. of chocolate ganache. Chocolate ganache is something we use here at the bakery a lot. It's basically just really good chocolate that is stirred into heated, heavy cream. You don't have to use that. You can literally just use. a really good fudge sauce that you like. And I'm adding chocolate. ganache to my bottom. That's the last thing. I'm going to put in here. Then I'm going to take my top,. and again, I'm just turning, you don't have to go all. He-Man on it, just be gentle. And now we have our second edge. So super important, here's. what we're going to do. We're taking that top edge. and we're lining it up with our bottom edge. And then we're just kind. of taking our finger and gently going around. Now, look, you've got a. little bit of melted chocolate on your plate. Just use that if you need. to, it's perfectly fine. And this is our sealed hot cocoa bomb. There you go. I'm going to straighten. up this edge a little bit. Absolutely use that. melted chocolate to create that smooth and pretty edge. And there you go, so that. is your death by chocolate hot cocoa bomb. So the next one I'm going to make for you is actually my salted. caramel hot cocoa bomb. It's probably one of. my personal favorites. It's definitely one of my kids' favorites. They are big fans of these. So again, we've got our heated plate, just making sure it's not super hot. If it's too hot guys when you're holding your. hot cocoa bomb shell, and you're trying to turn it, you're literally just going. to be melting chocolate everywhere. That's when you know it's too hot. So just take it away, let the plate sit there. for a minute or so. It'll cool off faster than you think. And then you can go ahead. and get started again. So I'm just going to go. ahead and turn that edge. Just melting that chocolate. I've got salted caramel hot cocoa. Yes I did. We're putting salted. caramel hot cocoa in this. As far as how many marshmallows,. I like marshmallows. So I try to probably. put about eight or so, just, you know as many as you want. I've got some little caramel bits which I think are super fun that we're going to put. right on top of there. And then the last thing we're going to put in the salted caramel is salted caramel. Now, you gotta be careful with this. It adds an amazing finish. to your hot cocoa bomb if you're making this. flavor, but it's warm, so when you pour it, you want to pour it directly. on top of the caramel bits and the marshmallows. If you go a little bit too. far to the left to the right, well, it's going to go right. through your chocolate shell. So you don't want to do that. I learned this the hard way. So just literally putting. a little bit right there, right on top. Just to say hello, just to say I'm here, that's all you're doing. We're going to go ahead and turn our top to get that all nice and melty and then we're gonna put it right on top. Now listen, if you put your top on and you realize it's crooked,. you realize it's wonky, that's okay, it happens. So depending on how quickly. you figure this out, you do have a few seconds. where you can maneuver it to the left or the right. If not, melt some chocolate,. put it in as a block bag, cut a little hole in it go back around the outside. of it once it's cool, it's fine, I promise it's fine. That's it for our salted caramel. So we're going to decorate. our death by chocolate hot cocoa bombs first. And so all I've done is I have melted some. chocolate in a Ziploc bag. And the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to drizzle our chocolate over the top of the surface. Then we're going to add. mini chocolate chips. And then we're also going. to do chocolate sprinkles because why not? So I've got everything. kind of within reach for me so that I don't have to. try to grab for things. This chocolate will. harden kind of quickly. So don't wait a few minutes because nothing will. stick to it after that. So literally just going back and forth, I love making these lines,. they just make me happy. We're going to sprinkle a few. just mini chocolate chips. And then we're just going to. do some chocolate sprinkles. How fun is that? So we finished up our death. by chocolate hot cocoa bombs. And now we're going to do the garnish on the salted caramel hot cocoa bombs. I actually have salted. caramel chocolate in my hand, which yes, it does exist. And yes, you can find it. Does that mean that you have to do that? Of course not, of course not, what you do, what you can find, you do, what you have access to, you do, what you and your family or. your friends fall in love with. And that's all that matters. But if you have access to it, they do make salted caramel chocolate, it's actually quite delicious. So for the salted caramel hot cocoa bombs, here's what we're going to do. I've got my melted salted. caramel chocolate in my hand. I've also got some flaked sea salt. Now again, you don't have. to use flaked sea salt. If you've never used it, it is a mild salt, it has. wonderful flavor to it, it has a beautiful presentation, which is why I like to use it. And it's great to finish things with. So just gonna go back and forth. You can actually see the. little flakes of salt in this caramel. And then I reach into my little box here, and we're just going to. put a sprinkling on top. Isn't that pretty? So now we're going to move on into some heart-shaped hot cocoa bombs, and these are a little trickier,. it's okay, you got this, I believe in you. But we're going to do the technique a little bit differently. So we've got some heart shaped molds. These have a little geometric. pattern on the top of them, which really is cool. once they get unmolded. And the first thing I'm going to do is I have got some luster dust. So because they're Valentine's Day, we want them to be even more special than they normally would be. We're actually making two different types of Valentine hot cocoa bombs today, we are making a very kid. friendly, family friendly version of chocolate dipped strawberry. And then we're also going to. be doing a grownup version of chocolate dipped. strawberry, ages 21 and up, but they're going to be super fun. I feel like we all need a little. extra something right now. So for those of you who do,. those are going to be for you. So this is just edible. glitter, edible luster dust, whatever you want to call it. So we're going to do. these a little different and we're just going to start. and you can see the glitter is coming out. This is going to look so cool once our chocolate gets on there. Sometimes it gets a little stuck so you gotta tap it. I told my assistant today that when I die and they do an autopsy they're going to discover that my lungs were full of sugar, flour and glitter, because that's what we got going on. All right, so for our other ones, we are actually going to do gold because I thought those. would be super pretty. So we are going to start. with our pastry brush. We are still going to be. doing two layers of chocolate in each of these shells. It's just, we're going to. do it like we're painting. So how fun is that? So you're going to move your shells as close as you can to your chocolate, because obviously you don't. want to drag it everywhere. So I'm just going to dip my. brush in the melted chocolate. And I'm literally just. going to start painting and you can add, you know, you can be generous with. the amount of chocolate that you're putting in there. And when you're using this brush, the great thing about it is that you're going to be able. to get in all these nooks and crannies. These particular heart shaped molds have kind of a geometric face to them, a geometric pattern to them. And because of that they have just all kinds of little angles. So you don't even have to worry so much about painting per se, you. know, with exact paint strokes, you literally can just dab. the chocolate with your brush. And you just want to make. sure that you bring those up the sides just like you did before. Try not to have any bare spots. If you do, if you realize. after you've done this that you got some bare spots, it's fine. Just go back through with your brush and your melted chocolate. and cover them up. It's not a problem. All right. So one of the challenges. when you're doing this is not having so much chocolate that you've over done yourself. You want to leave room. inside the chocolate shell for all the goodies that. we're going to put in there. So we are going to take these, we're going to pop them in the freezer, maybe five minutes or so, and then we're going to get them back. So I am almost done with. this second coat of chocolate and I know the edges are a. little messy that's fine. Once we pop these out and. we heat those edges up to attach our top and. bottom halves to each other, those messy edges will be all cleaned up. And they're ready for the freezer. So I have unmolded our. hearts and they're beautiful. So we're going to go. ahead and start assembling these heart shaped. chocolate dipped strawberry hot cocoa bombs for Valentine's day. So I've got our bottom right here. I've got my warm plate, gonna go ahead, just melt that chocolate a. little bit to smooth that edge. Remember when you get to this part, you got to move a little quick. So we're going to do a. table, sorry, teaspoon of chocolate hot cocoa. We are going to do a teaspoon. of strawberry hot cocoa. We're going to do some. dehydrated marshmallows, chocolate heart. Some dehydrated marshmallows, 'cause chocolate and. strawberry is super fun. We're going to do some sprinkles. A little more marshmallows. never hurt anybody. All right, we're going to take our lid. Same thing, remember guys,. you don't want to push down. You just kind of want to. guide it over the top lip. Then you want to take your. finger, take it along the edge. Now take your melted chocolate. right around your edge. Take a little bit of this. If you have a little bloop, no worries. All right, and there we go, a beautiful heart shaped hot cocoa bomb. I'm going to go ahead and do the next one. All right, so we're going. to do the grownup version. So we have our bottom that. has our beautiful gold shimmer on it. Also going to do teaspoon of chocolate, Hot cocoa powder, a teaspoon of strawberry hot cocoa powder. I have some strawberry. white chocolate truffles that I have cut just in half. to help them fit inside here, that are ridiculously good. I also, here's the grownup part, so I also have made a chocolate ganache and this chocolate ganache. has strawberry cream liqueur. It also has dark chocolate. mocha liqueur in the ganache and that's gonna go in the hot cocoa bomb. So we're going to go ahead and we're just going to. squeeze all that gloriousness over there. We're going to put some marshmallows and we're going to put some sprinkles 'cause grownups need sprinkles too. We're gonna do our lid Take our finger, go around that edge. And so for this ganache,. the recipe for that is you can literally just. take one cup of heavy cream, keep that in the microwave. until it just starts to simmer. You can take about one. cup or so of chocolate. And you're going to whisk. that into the heavy cream until it melts and then. you will add one cap of each of the liqueurs. So whatever liqueur you love, that's the liqueur you add. It doesn't have to be the ones that I did. I just wanted to do a chocolate. dipped strawberry theme. So with these heart shapes, they're a little more persnickety. So you may have to go along your edge just like I'm doing, to make. sure that they're sealed. Now we get to decorate them. All right, so this is our. family-friendly hot cocoa bombs. You guys can see, I've got. several different things, again, we're going to have everything that we want to decorate with. So I've got some very bright. pink melted chocolate. I've got conversation hearts. I've got more sprinkles than. anyone on one planet needs. That's okay. So we're going to go. ahead and decorate these. We're going to have a. little bit of fun with this. So you can go all the way back and forth like we did for the. sphere hot cocoa bombs. I'm just going to do them. a little bit differently. So I'm going to just do one side. So I'm going to kind. of start at the middle, isn't that pretty? Okay, so we've got our chocolate. Now we're going to take some. of our conversation hearts, put those on there. We're going to take some of our sprinkles, put those on there. How fun is that? Who would not love to get. one of these beautiful hot cocoa bombs for Valentine's day? So now we're going to do. our grownup hot cocoa bombs. So I've got a paler pink. chocolate in my hand, it's actually a strawberry. flavored chocolate, it's pretty readily available. at all of those craft stores we talked about earlier. I've got some different sprinkles now that have some gold in them, just 'cause I thought they. would be pretty with this. So we are just going to go. back and forth this one, and I'm going to go ahead and. go across the entire surface. And we are going to sprinkle. Look how pretty that is. All right so the last. thing we're going to do is I'm going to take our shimmer again and I'm just going to add a. little bit more to the top because quite frankly, everything in life could. use a little more sparkle. I'm gonna take our red. and I'm going to go over these one more time and there you have it. So I have one more trick up my sleeve that I'm going to share with you guys. So I'm gonna move these over a second. So I have just a heat proof coffee mug. This is actually one of. the bakery's coffee mugs that we have here because. everything here is pink. And so here's what we're going to do. I have melted some of. our white Almond Bark. So I'm going to actually dip the very top of our mug. in our white chocolate and we're going to put it. in Valentine's sprinkles. What a beautiful presentation for your Valentine hot cocoa bombs. So we're going to go ahead and just dip about the top quarter. inch or so just like that. Shake off the excess a. little bit, see what you got. And then I've got a. plate full of super fun Valentine sprinkles, and you can go around the edge. and just kind of move that up so that it sticks to your chocolate. Feel free to turn your cup 'cause your sprinkles will always settle in one place or another. This is a great activity for kids to do. It's so fun for them. The chocolate just acts like glue. Seriously, how adorable is that? I hope you all had a great time joining me and learning how to make hot cocoa bombs. I hope you take what you've learned, you spend some time with. your friends and your family and you come up with your. own versions of these. Happy Valentine's Day. Thanks so much for joining me. - Now, Terry tells me that her. favorite is a salted caramel and look how pretty, I mean, you just know that. there's something special inside of it.

BN4ocGVWy88.json;"- Okay, Bobby, this is. another retro recipe. Southern tea cakes. - Very retro. They're so good. - All right, so we're gonna. stir together our flour, and that's just extra. flour, and that's our sugar, and our baking powder and baking soda, I believe, check that recipe, son. - Baking flour- - [Paula] Soda and powder. - Four, baking soda, baking powder, yep. - [Paula] And how much salt? - I don't see salt. - I don't have any salt. in that recipe, but- - Just a pinch, it'll always do ya. - I like sweet and. salty, so I'm going to do maybe a 1/2 a teaspoon because. we are cutting this recipe in 1/2 'cause it makes so many. So if you'd start your sifting. - When did you, I don't know, I don't know how I remember. you doing tea cakes. Where did this recipe come from? - Oh my gosh, son, it's. so old, I can't tell ya. - Did you make 'em for us. when I was a little kid? - Oh my gosh, you don't remember. It was just a big, white cookie. - I do remember. - [Paula] Just a big, white cookie. - I do remember, but maybe. that memory is blotted out by the, the chocolate. gobstoppers that you used to wrap in Saran wrap and put in the refrigerator. - Put in the refrigerator. - Everything else is sort of shoved aside. I think about how those. things were so good. - Okay, you wanna start doing that? - So I'm sifting, I'm sifting,. I'm sifting, I'm sifting. - Yeah, sift, sift, sift. - Okay, got it. - Rather than pulling out a sifter, I just use this little strainer sometimes, you know, if I don't have a. tremendous amount of flour. - [Bobby] Well, what's the difference? Just the sifter would have a handle on it and sort of spin it around? Well, this works just fine. This is what you'd use. for like powdered sugar on top of a cake or something like that. - Exactly. - Or to wash your vegetables in. I'd wash my vegetables in, oh, look at that, there goes Aunt Peggy. - Look here at great, great. - Aunt Peggy, we're making tea cakes. - What you doing? - [Peggy] I came to see what I can sample. (laughing) - [Paula] Well, I just took. tomato grits out of the oven. - I'll try those. - [Paula] C'mon. - Just a small serving. - All right, listen, how. a serving like that size? - [Peggy] That'll do it. (laughing) She eats like a bird, y'all. Come on in. - Okay, well we have sifted, this is done. The only left is, you know what's left? - What? - Salt. (laughing) - Push it through because it's kosher. It sure is. - Why push it through when I. can just dump it into my hand and drop it in here? - [Paula] Bobby, you are a little smart. - Well, that's why I went to Harvard. (laughing) All those years ago, Aunt Peggy. I bet you didn't know. that, did ya, Aunt Peggy. - [Peggy] I knew you when I was there. - You went to Hardin. (laughing) - I went to Hardin. - [Peggy] I'm waiting. (laughing) - [Paula] You don't even standing up. - She's over there waiting on you to bring her a bowl of grits. - [Peggy] Yeah, I never run across the- - Well, in the meantime I. will be here making tea cakes, which I've never read before,. so, so far I've sifted flour and I've sifted baking. powder and baking soda. And I've sifted some, how you doing? (laughing) Hey, I sifted some kosher salt. You're looking good. - [Paula] Doesn't she look good? - She looks great. Come on in and get some grits. And now we have to add two eggs, a 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and. 1/2 stick of softened butter and a little bit of vanilla,. a teaspoon of vanilla. - [Paula] Yeah. - Yeah. Did you catch all that? - No, but I know you did. - I got all the dry and we've sifted it, so now we're going to add. the rest of the ingredients. - We've got to add one egg. - Gotta add one egg. - And let's beat this. egg up with that 1/2 cup of buttermilk, how about that? - All right. - And then y'all, we're. gonna have to put this in the refrigerator and let. it sit for about an hour. - We could make something. else while we do that, right? I love cooking with you. I get all kinds of. things that I never get. Taste sugar and salt. - Yes. - Butter. (laughing) Almost forgot what it tasted like. - All right, let's see. Now when do we put in that butter? - Everything now. - And remaining ingredients, yes. There we go, so we need a little vanilla. - This is nice. - That butter soft? - It's nice and soft, so we'll. just, before you add that, let's see if you can. incorporate that butter. - Does everything have a stick of butter? - Yes, son. The original is two sticks, but we're only halfing the recipe. (laughing) Don't give your mama no lip. - No. - Yeah, you wanna use pastry cutter. - That's it. - Yeah. - Yeah, just do it that. way, and you know what? I'll go ahead and add the vanilla to your egg and buttermilk too. - Okay. - [Paula] You know what? I think I wanna put a little. almond flavor in it too. What do you think? - [Bobby] I think it sounds good. What's the- - [Paula] Bobby, you have. stepped in something sticky, son. I hear you just talking. - It's just clean, shoes are just clean. - [Paula] Well, last night I found honey. - So what is the, the flavor of a tea cake is really kind of mild, isn't it? I mean, there's not. really a whole lot to it. - Nope, it's very good. and I just think, Bobby, one of those recipes that. started so, so, so long ago, when you didn't have a lot of ingredients. Women came up with, and men, I guess, I'm sure some of the men were cooks. But, you know, people. just came up with what they had to work with. and they always had flour and they always had eggs 'cause. most people had chickens. - Well, that butter mixed right in. - 'Cause it was nice and soft. Now this is gonna be wet and sticky, you're gonna wanna change utensils. - Try with the spoon or. with a whisk, do you think? - I'd go to a spoon. Spoon it. There you go. It's so nice to have. a man around the house 'cause sometimes mixing up stuff is hard. - [Bobby] So we're going to. combine all this together and then we're gonna. form it into like a disc, like kind of just a big, flat ball. And then we refrigerate. for an hour, is that right? - [Paula] Yeah, so we can roll it out. - [Bobby] What's the reason. for refrigerating it? So it becomes-. - [Paula] So it can get hard. So we can roll it. - Aunt Peggy, how's the grits? - [Peggy] Good. - [Paula] Yay, where ya going? - [Peggy] Putting my. (indistinct) out of my way. - Oh, okay, now I need to push you up. I'm just afraid to. - [Peggy] Yeah, I know. - [Paula] You need to sit. back before I push you up so I don't remove your breast. - [Peggy] I like if you. just let me hang out here. (Peggy talking quietly in background) - [Paula] Okay, so you're. saying don't push ya. - [Bobby] Okay, Mom, I think. it's pretty well combined. - [Paula] Okay, ooh, yeah, that's good. So what I'm gonna do now is- - [Bobby] Did we add the vanilla? - [Paula] Yes, I added. it to the buttermilk. - [Bobby] I have stood. here in eaten plums. Mom's got all the plums. on the counter right there and I must've eaten seven. - [Cameraman] Yeah, it was full. - [Bobby] It was full, yeah. - [Paula] The best. plums I think I've ever- - I've got a little bit of a- - Oh no, a stomachache. - Yeah. - Well, if you have to run to. the bathroom, I understand. - No, no, I'm just kina like,. like I ate too many plums. - Well, they are so good. - They're fantastic. - So I'm going to get all that- - I love fresh fruit juice. I'll stand around and just eat. fruit all day at our house. We all do. - I know it. And little Ollie likes it as good as you. - [Bobby] Oh my gosh, my. kid (speaking faintly). - [Paula] She just takes it. She picks it up and crams it in her mouth. (laughing) - [Bobby] You should see that child eat. - [Paula] All three of your. children are good eaters. - [Bobby] Yeah, I don't know. where they get that from. - [Paula] I don't know. - Can you get a good. closeup on Pearl's face? Maybe we'll see where it all comes from? Just throw in the food towards the face. (laughing) - That's all right. - [Theresa] Paula, he's being mean, you have flour all over your face. - You've got flour all over your face. - I do? - [Theresa] That's why- - I've gotta clean damn. paper towel right here. - Well aren't you used to do it. - Well, aren't you used to doing that, cleaning somebody's. face all day, aren't ya? - Well, I'm more concerned. with the dagum floor and the walls and the TV. They can get it off their own faces. They just throw it all in my kitchen. - All right, look at that. beautiful dough, y'all. - Oh, it's perfect. - [Paula] That is some pretty dough. - [Bobby] That came together- - [Paula] So easily. - [Bobby] Just lickity split. You know what? Hold on just a sec. - [Paula] What? - [Bobby] You've got a couple of, you got one hanging on the wall over here. - [Paula] Oh the banana pudding recipe. - [Bobby] Yes, but I this- - [Paula] But I didn't sew that one. - But this is, this is what we're making right now. - Yes. Grandma's Tea Cakes. - Grandma's Tea Cakes and this- - That called for lard, Bobby. I probably did that in. the early, early '70s. - Mama would have, I remember. this hanging in our house my whole life. - Your whole life. - I say our house, like. we lived in one house, that is not what I mean. We moved all over the place. - 23 times we moved. - Every apartment that we lived in, every house that we rented, every place that we hung our hats, I remember Grandma's Tea Cakes crochet, is that the word you use? - [Paula] No, cross stitch. - Cross stitch, handing. in every, look at that. - [Paula] Every kitchen we had. - I mean, look at that. - Where did you find that? I can't remember where it is. - And this is the. original frame, obviously. - Oh gosh, yeah. I wonder if it has the date on it. - No way that I can see,. it doesn't have one here. There's no tellin'. I wonder if there's $100. hidden in here someplace. I'd be willing to make. a bet that there is no. - There is not. - No, no. - [Paula] I'd be. surprised if you found $1. - Yeah, me too. Looks like somebody's already checked, so if there was one there, it's long gone. - You know, son, I do remember that day you came over to my house. You were living with one of. your buddies at that time. You came home, you said,. ""Mom, I'm so hungry."" And I said, ""I am too, son."" - How come I didn't look like it? (laughing) I guess we ate all the starches. And you said, ""I'm so hungry."" And I said, ""I am too, son."" I said, ""Let me go to our change drawer ""and see if I can get. up enough money for us ""a number two at McDonald's."" And in the bottom of. that little bitty change, in that white jewelry box, I found a $50 bill that I had. Bobby me danced all over that living room. And he got in his car and he. went to McDonald's and got us two or maybe three number twos. - I remember, that would have- - I got a number two. - That would have been, we got a lot of number twos in our life. (laughing) - Yeah, we got a lot of number twos. - That would have been. about 1990, maybe? '89? '88, '89, something like that. Ah, who cares. Alright, so Grandma's Tea Cakes. That's what we're making now, into the fridge for about an hour, so we're gonna go and we'll. be back in about an hour. - Yes. Okay, y'all I'm going to finish. up those Southern tea cakes by myself 'cause Bobby had to leave, but I'm doing this a little. different from the recipe. It says to roll 'em out, y'all, but you know what, to slice. 'em is so much easier. So that's what I'm gonna do. rather than rolling them out and then sticking and. having to, it's just a mess. So this is the way we're. gonna do our tea cakes. And like I said earlier, they just a plain cookie. that all the housewives, the women doing the cooking, or the men. They always had these. particular ingredients, so nothing fancy. And they're just a big round cookie. He's kind of flattened on one side, so I'm having to kind of give. 'em another little shape. - [Cameraman] Tea biscuits. - Tea biscuits, yes, tea biscuits. That looks like biscotti. - [Cameraman] Yeah. - Ooh, I made some of Greg Cantor's biscotti the other day, y'all. It was the best I've ever eaten. So go to Greg's Kitchen, I think is how his Facebook page reads. You will not be sorry. He is a friend of mine and. that boy knows he can cook. So Greg's Kitchen. And it was peanut butter. Peanut butter. - [Cameraman] White chocolate. - And white chocolate biscotti. And Greg sent me some. in the mail and I said, ""Ooh, I got to have this. recipe, I got to call him."" And he said it's on his website. So we went to his website and sure enough, there it was first recipe that came up. So Greg, I thank you so much. All right, this one looks a little shy, so I'm gonna come down here. and get a little bit more and stick up underneath that one. This is also a good cookie that you could, if you wanted to roll it out,. you could do it for Christmas. Do it in Santa Claus shapes or, that one's a little thin, too. (dog barking) And there we go. There they go. (laughing) So we're gonna put this. in the oven at 350. I can't remember for how long Theresa. It's been so long since I made a tea cake. - [Theresa] Where's my recipe? - But Bobby showed y'all earlier. - [Theresa] 10 to 12 minutes. - Okay, 10 to 12 minutes. You wanna set that timer, Theresa? - [Theresa] I certainly will. - Bobby showed y'all the. cross stitch that I did for the tea cake recipe. I did that back in the '70s, early '70s- - [Theresa] You wanna put 'em in? - When I used to make 'em. Yes, Theresa would like for. me to put 'em in the oven. - [Theresa] They're home cooked. - Did Bobby 'bout drive you crazy talking. - [Theresa] No. - You sitting there and. waiting for him to shut up. - [Theresa] No, not at all. I like his stories. - I do too. I love his stories. Okay, 10 minutes. I think I let these cook. for like 12 minutes. The recipe called for 10, But I think 12 was the magic number. So you see, these are just very, very plain, unpretentious, delicious cookies. And you could certainly dress 'em up. You could brush 'em with some. egg white and put sprinkles on 'em or something like that. Or like I said, you could roll them out like the recipe tells you. to do into different shapes, but to me a tea cake. should look just like this. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Almost looks like a flat. biscuit, doesn't it? - [Theresa] Strawberries and whipped cream will be fabulous with it. - Oh gosh, yes. This would make a powerful. good strawberry shortcake. Just pour some sweetened. strawberries on top and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then some fresh whipped cream on top. It would be so good. So that's it. But those of y'all that. have never had a tea cake, please think about trying this recipe 'cause I've been making. it for a hundred years and Bobby went into the. laundry room and found this, that he showed y'all earlier. Something I did back in the '70s because I made a lot of tea cakes. So that's it. Y'all enjoy, have a. wonderful day, stay safe and I'll see y'all next time. Love and best dishes.";['postres']
BwhOVvFdDgQ.json;hey y'all I hope I hope y'all are on well I hope everybody has kind of settled into this new normal you know whatever in the heck it is I know that I've been in the kitchen cooking a lot of stuff y'all because that's one of the ways I found myself a way to keep me busy and occupied and keep everybody fed at the same time because you know that's always how I've showed my love for somebody is cooking for them so I want to share this recipe with y'all today and as I've told you before I'm feeling requests and I got a bunch but eventually I will get to your request so today I'm gonna share with y'all loaded banana bread if y'all like me you know you'll buy a bunch of bananas and you may not be in the mood to eat bananas so I wound up having to make banana bread with them and so I'm gonna show y'all this wonderful recipe and this is actually from my newest book southern bacon and this recipe is wonderful because it's got so much stuff in it in fact oh look at this one I've already baked it and brought in either oven Oh doesn't that look delicious lots of nuts I think that's why I like it so much because it's nutty kind of like its maker so the first thing I'm gonna do y'all is mix up my dry ingredients so that is 2 cups of all-purpose flour what's that 1/2 a cup of sugar no 1 cup of sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder make sure you get it on that out half a teaspoon of salt and a half it I think it's a half a teaspoon wonder what I do in the glasses half a teaspoon of baking soda y'all my glasses all right so that's our dry ingredients and you want to take your whisk and whisk all those ingredients together because that's almost like sifting it doing this during this quarantine my dog has gotten so jumpy they barked at the drop of a hat New Year's Teresa got three nervous Nellie's okay I'm gonna flip back to the side and now we're gonna mix up a wet ingredients and I want to show y'all the way that I've come up with during the years over the years you know any way I can find to help help the process so I like to mash my bananas and you'll want to make sure they're very very ripe in fact an over overripe banana makes the best bread so I like to mash that in the skin and then just peel it and that gives it a great head start so just like that and I'm gonna just get every bit of that banana all right so I'm gonna use four ripe bananas and this will yield me one 9x5 loaf pan of bread and I'll tell you what it's real real good to make up to make a spread to go on this bread if you'll make take up cream cheese and herbs and make your herbs bring it it is so good with that brand it's delicious rather than something sweet something savory in fact I had the most wonderful recipe for cream cheese but I don't know what I did with it it's somewhere up then the other two million recipes in my head all right so this is a great tip if you always use it doesn't take nearly so much muscle all right so I'm gonna a4 mashing my bananas alone see see how quickly new when you mash them in the peeling it goes so quick alright so I'm gonna add my vanilla 1 teaspoon of vanilla I think that was a half a stick of melted butter is that right okay and yogurt now I am using Greek yogurt for this recipe but when I made that first rafi I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream and it worked out perfect so we just don't mix something called wet ingredients now I'm gonna add the eggs and look at my beautiful eggs y'all you know we got a chicken coop and the depends on the chicken is to want color their eggs are hey Mikey and I've got how many chickens do we have that lay the blue eggs Mike just move on and the rest are brown they're so pretty these almost look like Easter eggs I love that I think that's about the color of our living room Long's eat me that's why I like that that color so much alright and these are fresh free shakes yo and my pinky swears she can tell the difference so anyway skip back to the banana period I love making muffins and fruity breads because you never ever have to pull out a mixer because one of the rules of making muffins and breads like this is that you come over beat them you want to just mix those ingredients until they're blended so no need to pull out a mixer okie dokie so we're going to pour this into our flour you move these banana peeling so I'm gonna add 1/2 a cup of raisins and I'll do love love love raisins and I'm giving you the recipe just as it reads um half a cup of nuts let's whatever call a once in the nut family so I had it a few more I just love what the nuts do to it okay and um I've got a half a cup reserved here because I'm gonna sprinkle that on top you can see where I sprinkle the the nuts on top of that alright so this is almost mixed up good enough hmm those bananas smells so strong wonderful banana aroma is in there all right so here we go we're ready to put this together and I'm just gonna try to fold that in and it'll take I don't take 2 or 3 minutes but not not long I just go under and bring that flower up to the top and the egg mixture down and this is a real thick batter y'all so don't don't worry you've got plenty of liquid mm-hmm it's coming together y'all and remember just until it's all the flour is moistened be so good all right since we're gonna have to love John we out too well you can take one home Teresa or we I did y'all eat everything you sent home the other day I'm trying to help Teresa not have to cook some way all right so I don't I don't see any more drag flour so here we go I'm gonna spray my pan that's what sounds like it's just about out breathe come out very very easy okay that is some pretty batter booty booty booty and I mean I want everybody see what was left in the bowl that would make like that okay all right so you'll want to take the back of your spatula and just level this out and we're gonna put it in the oven set at 350 and we're gonna bake it for 50 minutes and after its baked for 20 minutes I'm gonna take some fall and and cover it with fit ten fall because I don't want the top to get too dark so that easy love it love those recipes so I have the kiddos anybody wanna taste mm-hmm well y'all come on tell me what you think whoo whee doggie we can tailor nothing yes none of us have got anything there you go Eddie what do you think is it good me and Josie hmm it's so good yeah uh put that on my face

okay now we're starting with uh a refrigerated pie shell that we have just put and pressed and fluted into our pie plate now i'm gonna start adding about two cups of pecans now some people like their pecan halves whole some people like them chopped up they say they that the pie piece is cut better i want to make the same pie that you make in your restaurant okay i'm using halves here today okay all right so i'm gonna put about two cups now this is the way we do it at the restaurant and this way we know that we've got just the right amount of pecans you see how i've covered the bottom of that shell mm-hmm i've got some melted butter over there if you would pass me that butter please max and should i pour it into it just pour it on it you cannot mess up this pie pecan pie i promise you cannot mess it up all right now i've got my measuring cup because we're gonna measure out a dark corn syrup and that syrup is gonna make almost like a custard do you remember when you cut into that pie and it was kind of like a dark almost custardy like this is exactly the thing i dream of every night yes how much should i cook half a cup of dark syrup wow this is so beautiful now the reason we sprayed our cup is cause you know how sticky syrup is and look it's yeah pour it on in so see the way that syrup just slips away from our dish and it's so beautiful yes it's so beautiful and we're not

c2qKEbnEYnk.json;- Hey everybody, it's a beginning to look a lot. like Christmas around here. I'm in my mom's kitchen and today you and I are going to make together a beautiful Christmas trifle and we're going to make it right out of my mom's cookbook,. Paula Deen Cuts the Fat. It's a beautiful trifle. and it's great because it's really, really reduced in sugar, which is just a great thing. My mom, it's no secret, my. mom is a type two diabetic. And for all of you out. there who might be diabetic, or just trying to look. for ways to cut the fat, it's a great recipe for. you really low in sugar. Okay. It starts with baking a cake. So in the name of time,. we've already done that. And I want to show you that it is possible to find sugar-free cake mixes. You can see the brand. right on the top here. No reason to hide it, but sugar-free, you can find them in. your local grocery store or at, one of your. - [Woman] I and Tom bought at Walmart. - At Walmart, you can find it. So we've got our yellow cake mix and I've already cut it into cubes for the tri-fold because you can imagine what a trifle is, it's. going to end up in this big, beautiful crystal dish. And it's going to be a layered cake and well, let's just get started and I'll show you what it's going to be. So the cake is made. Now the second step in the. process is going to be, we're going to go to our stove top here. And we are going to a sauce pan here, add two cups of raspberry preserves. Now, if you're a canner, you may already have. some raspberry preserves at your house that you made fresh, or if you don't, you. can get them in a jar. We'll add to that two. tablespoons of water. - [Woman] And that is. actually sugar-free. Shelly. - I should mention as we go, because it's very important. It's sugar-free raspberry preserve. - [Woman] We do actually,. Bobby get a lot of requests from folks out there that ask about reduced calorie, reduced sugar, diabetic friendly recipe. So this perfect. - Hey, look, I've said this before, but you know the people, those of you out there who are diabetic, I know it's kind of a bomber. It feels like a bomber, to have to eat the way you do. I know that's the way that. some people feel about it, but honestly, that's the way. that we all should be eating. I got to tell you, sugar is just sugar is tough man, it's not good for you. And you shouldn't eat. and drink a lot of it. You should use moderation. when it comes to that. But if you can make things sugar-free and they're still delicious, you should. So that's what we're doing. And I think that we're. going to be no worse to where at the end of this recipe. I think I'll bet that. you'll never even notice that it's sugar free. How about that? Because we are going to. make with this heavy cream. So there's two cups of heavy cream to go along with us. So the decadence is there. You're going to get that. delicious decadence satisfying thing in your heavy cream but the sugar will be. way, way, way reduced. And that's a good thing. And turn this down just a little bit, maybe to like a medium, going to get a little bit of simmer going into our preserves, we are going to add some fresh raspberries. Oh, Man. Raspberries are. really one of my favorites, my kids love them and they just sit around. and eat raspberries, like they're not anymore growing. So indoor raspberries to our preserved, preserves, excuse me, into our sauce pan, and that already looks. and smells delicious, and we've only just begun and we've got a ways to go. So why don't we take a break right here? Let this cook for about. two or three minutes and I'll see you then, got two minutes. (mixer whipping) All right. Beautiful. That's great. Looking whipped cream. Okay. - [Woman] We went ahead. and did the whipped cream because it makes so much noise that you can't hear Bobby over the mixer's. - Nobody likes to watch people mix whipped cream on camera. Okay. So I'm just going to stick, I'm going to put the bowl back in the fridge here. That'll be ready when we come to it. Okay. Here is our raspberry and preserve mixture on the stove top. It's beautiful. It looks and smells delicious. It's kind of like a raspberry potpourri. - [woman] Yeah. - Just got really low there. We have to turn it off. - [Woman] You need to. let it cool a little bit. - Yeah, I'm going to let. it cool a little bit. And then we are going to grab our trifle dish. So my mother's Christmas trifle. We've got all the components together. So our cake is baked and I've already got it. cut into little cubes. We've got our raspberry puree and a fresh raspberry mix. already kind of sauteed off and we're cooling it. This is a great method to cool. Anything. So we've got a bowl. right inside of a bowl. So that's just ice water in there. Theresa and I, and the neighbor Tom said, let's cool this stuff down real quick. This is also a great way to, what's a great way to cool down anything. So let's go ahead and begin. to put together our trifle. I've got a beautiful,. beautiful crystal dish here. This is mom's. Gosh, this is gorgeous. And I hope I do it justice, because this is where you. really need a Baker's touch, - [Woman] I have faith in you. - I have faith in myself too. So we're going to put together about a third of the. trifle down in the bottom, and it's just going to be layers of trifle or excuse me of cake and then the raspberry mix and then a little whipped cream and we'll continue on. until we get to the top and we'll end with whipped cream. That'll be the last thing and a little garnish on top and I'll hold the garnish as a surprise, I'll let you know what that is, but you probably already know. So one third of the cake, and again, this is a sugar-free Cake Knicks, which is it's wonderful. to know that is out there. Right. - [Woman] Yeah. - Okay. So. - [Woman] And it looks exactly like cake. - And it looks exactly like, and I'm sure that it tastes great. Should I give it a little bit of a, let me tell you what sugar-free - [Woman] Let's see your face when you - Taste like. - [Woman] Can you even tell. a difference? I couldn't. - It's very good. And it's. very light is I like it. I like it. I would probably prefer it. Okay. And if the sweetness is there, it just comes a little. late and it's very light. Okay. So our raspberry preserve mixture. Let me try to get this even, I don't know if my mom would be happy with the job that I'm doing so far or not. It's a little rustic and uneven here. Everything is, but I'm a man. - [Woman] You're more of a. perfectionist than she is. - Oh, well, that's true. - [Woman] I was going to. say she would just be dumpy. - You think so, I just. don't want to run out of my. - [Woman] I would be doing. exactly how you're doing. - Raspberry mix here. Just want to have some place. to kind of platform my, - [Woman] Which my cream, - My cream, which is that's pretty already just the dish is doing a lot of the work just by being so dad gum pretty. We can have pretty. She, always say that's a. she, what kind of she is. And we'll go with a rubber's patch here. Some of our whipped cream. I love it. And do some spreading from side to side. - [Woman] Now your trifle bowls, Bobby, just so you know, some. are deeper than others. So in some you get three. layers, some layers. Sometimes you may only get two layers. - Yeah, - [Woman] That's fine too. - Yep. That's a good point. Yep. Very good point, Theresa. Okay. I hope I'm not. making a sloppy mess here. I think it looks pretty. Okay. Try to always think what would my mama do? That's part of the pressure of having Paula Deen as a mother,. whenever you're making anything. So like, well, what would my mama do? I know that she would critique. I know she would have. something to say about this. So make that look even, you messing it up. That's too much. That's not enough. - [Woman] She would not have said that. - She would say exactly that. - [Woman] That you've. been part of yourself - She would say exactly in that too. So some more cake? - [Woman] I think the. beauties of trifles are they, there's not a, they're. just a layered look. And you just want to have that, that layer of so that you can see cake, you see the raspberry, you see. - Yeah. I think that that's true. - [Woman] I really think. you can mess up a trifle. - Oh, well, you know, you could, - [Woman] I disagree with you on that one - I may be messing it up. right now, unbeknownst. - [Woman] Well, guess what. your mom's coming home tonight. - And she's going to see it. - [Woman] So I'll have her. taste it and I will let her. - Oh, well I know it's. going to taste good, but what's it gonna look like? You know? Cause like my mama always says, you eat with in your eyes first son, you eat with your eyes first. Just make sure I got. plenty of cake in there and I got some small pieces. So I'll kind of do some wedge and some of that down in. there. That looks good. Okay. And now back to our preserves. - [Woman] Yeah. This. has a wider trifle bowl versus kind of a slimmer and taller. - I'm wishing I had some more preserves to be completely honest. That looks nice. And it smells so good. And it just looks like. Christmas, doesn't it? Doesn't this thing just say Christmas, we're going to come up a. little shine that's alright We'll make it work. Look at this little beautiful device that my mom has got here,. this thing is handy dandy. That's worked hard in its. lifetime. How does it look? - [Woman] I want to say. - I think it looks really pretty. That's something that was handed down by your grandmother Paul. or your, mom or somebody. - 1000 years old - [Woman] She worries. about it falling apart. - Yeah. Well it's beginning to, - [Woman] I think you need. to put more whipped cream. - I'm going to okay. Well. you can stand in for my mama. - [Woman] Just checking - If you need to put more whipped cream. So, oh. And you know what, when I was doing the preserves and the fresh raspberry mix on the stove top over there, I took a look back my mom's recipe. And it said now, and top of. your trifle with the rest, with the second point of. strawberries I was like or raspberries I was like. Ooh I put them all in. - [Woman] But what did we do? - I had rescue them. I. rescued some out of the pot out of the sauce pan I think this looks great. - [Woman] I think it looks fabulous. You can see all the layers. - Can you? - [Woman] Keep turning. it? Yeah, so pretty. And the more it sits,. the more it'll settle. - One more cake. Hmm Hmm. Look at this. So, so good looking. And it makes your house. smell so great cakes in the preserves. I think I already said that. it was like a potpourri those raspberry preserve like potpourri on the stove top and that really were, hold off those last two. pieces of cake there. - [Woman] You're going to. get this patch around here. - Yeah I'm going to do that - [Woman] I'm gonna. let you get this patch. I'm going to put this on hold. - Okay. Let's take a quick break and y'all can come back to. help me top it off. Alright. Okay. This looks really, really nice. And so the layers go cake, raspberries, whipped cream, cake, raspberries, whipped cream, repeat and finish with the whipped cream. Ooh, look at that. That is a lot of whipped cream and it looks so good. - [Woman] (indistinct) - Hmm, yeah, that's right. So the sugar that we're losing is going to be made up. for by the whipped cream. And it's a good thing that. we had a low humidity day down here in Savannah, Georgia. - [Woman] I see, your mom would be proud because you're scraping that. bowl right down to the end. - Every bit of it. Hey look, when you spend a bunch of years in the restaurant business, you do not waste boy. - [Woman] Let's do that again. Tell him what she says to you. - I said, when you spend a bunch of years in the restaurant business,. you do not waste boy. - [Woman] Now that's Paula Deen. - That is Paula Deen. Wow. Look at that. I think that looks great. I mean, it looks homemade that's for sure. - [Woman] Oh my gosh! I can't wait to see what the saved raspberries. - Yeah. So we'll go on finish with raspberries right on the top here. And it's a good thing. I did that because there's some of those preserves. attached to them too. And you can see the preserves. - [Woman] I like the. jam part on it. So see. - Them sort of spread out. into that whipped cream. And I'm not going to waste one bit of it. I'm going to make sure it all. gets used. Look how pretty These colors, these just. scream Christmas, holidays. - [Woman] It's so nice to. give an option to people. that's not, because not everybody walks in and says they really want something low calorie, but it's kind of nice to be able to say, Hey, if your sugar, if you want something. sugar for you we've got it. - Or, what's even more fun than that is to just surprise people and let them know afterwards. - [Woman] True - After you've served it. Did you like that? I really did. Well guess what? That's a sugar-free cake mix. It's low sugar, reduced sugar preserves. - [Woman] And we saved you some calories - And we saved you some calories, the whipped cream, the whipped. cream is not low-calorie. Okay. So I think it looks really nice. And the only thing missing is a little garnish for the top. And what we like is fresh mint. A lot of us have mint in our gardens down here in the south. I grow mint at my house.. It grows very easily. - [Woman] And everywhere. - It's everywhere. - [Woman] It will take over. - And it looks great right on top. So I don't know about you, but I'd eat it. - [Woman] Me too. Bobby. - That looks great. Merry. Christmas, everybody. See you next time.;['postres']

cgWt9qhT0lo.json;"- Good morning my friends. Welcome to ""Paula's. Quarantine Cooking Kitchen!"" (Paula laughs) It's my hope that y'all enjoy these and take aside a few minutes every day to just sit and forget about. everything that irks you, and just sit back and spend a. little time with me and relax. You know, good time filler. (laughs) So anyway, I hope y'all are enjoying it. I get so many letters y'all,. so many letters from y'all, and I appreciate each. and every one of them. And to catch y'all up. my eyes are still bad, no makeup, and I feel like I'm standing here in. front of y'all butt naked! (Paula laughs) Without my makeup on, but listen. I got something really,. really, really, really pretty for y'all to look at now. Guess who is gonna be in. the kitchen with me today? My daughter-in-law, and. the mother of my triplets, look, twirl for them. - Okay okay okay.. - Twirl, twirl, okay, come twirl. - Say it again, say it again. - Claudia Deen! (laughs) Oh I love this girl! - I love you too Geni, grandma. - She is a fabulous wife and mother. - Mm-hm. - Uh-huh. - And daughter-in-law. (Claudia laughs) - And daughter, oh, well that. goes without saying I thought. So, she is from Venezuela. - Yes. - So y'all might notice. a little tiny accent. (Claudia laughs) And Claud has been so incredible at feeding our three babies. She has just done an incredible job. Bobby just sent me a video of them eating their oatmeal with a spoon. - Oh yes, oh you saw that? - They are doing so good. - And I think Linton is. gonna be a left-handed. - You think, well I noticed. he was eating with his right. - Well that was my fault, my fault. Because I put the spoon. like this when I served it, so he went for the right hand,. and he did it pretty good, but with his left he's even better. Like I have to have him send. you a video with the left hand. So much better, but I think. he can dominate both now. - I hope that when it's. really come time to choose that he'll choose the right-hand. - No the left one! - Why? - I don't know they say that. left-handed are really smart. - [Eddie] Yes. (laughs) - Are you a left-handed? (Claudia laughs) - My daddy was left-handed. - I'm sure he was really smart!. - But everything... (both laughing). Yes. But everything is made for right-handed people.. - Well, I don't know. - So I'm hoping, Eddie's. just shaking his head no. - Maybe the world needs. to update themselves. (laughing) And do everything. able for everyone. - Well I'm pulling for. a right-handed man, but. - I'm pulling for a left. - Whatever, whatever, whatever. - Just to make it even more. different from the girls he has to be a left-handed. - (laughs) Well I mean, he. can't get any more different than the girls, those. piercing blue eyes this big. And then the girls with. those piercing black eyes, that big. - Well he can be a left-handed, (laughs) to make it even more different. - Every one of them are special. - Yeah, they are special.. - They are so, so special. So Claud has been really innovative in her preparing foods so if there's any of y'all out there, (Paula quietly burps) excuse me, any of y'all out there watching that has a new baby that. you're trying to introduce to foods, y'all will enjoy this. If not, y'all just enjoy. hearing her talk. (laughs) - Everything we make I eat. - Go girl! - Everything we're gonna. make, I eat it at my house. - Okay, so this is not. just for the babies. - No, and actually the. first thing we're gonna do which is an Acai Bowl is very simple is very summery. - Okay. - You're already peeling the bananas. - I'm trying to peel your frozen bananas. - Thank you.. (Paula laughing) But this is something. that I eat for breakfast or as a snack, and actually for the babies I'll do it a little bit different. I just wouldn't add granola on the top because they could choke. But other than that they could. totally eat it as a smoothie. Like as a snack we do a lot of smoothies so this will be an option,. especially now that it's so hot. - So this is a smoothie. for adults or children. - It's a bowl. - It's a what? - A bowl, an acai bowl, so. instead of like smoothie it's gonna be more like an ice cream. - Oh, yay, I'm in! - Yeah.. (both laughing) Not like the one you brought us. - Yes. - Yeah, not like that one,. more like a fruity one, so! Which is still in my freezer by the way and I use it as a food coloring yesterday. - Oh, good! (laughing) - I just mix it with water. - And what were you wanting to, why were you wanting to color food?. - Oh I'll have to show you. Did you see it Eddie? - [Eddie] No. - Okay, I did something. called pouring station. - [Eddie] I did. - You seen it?. - For the babies? - Yeah, yeah, so it's. like, you grab a section like a place where you put different kinds of plastic containers different sizes, different. shapes, whatever. And then you fill them up with. different amounts of water So they say that you can use food coloring so I only had orange food coloring. You can use whatever colors just to make the water different colors. And I was like well I'm. just gonna use Paula's pink ice cream as a food coloring (laughs) So I had pink, it was your. ice cream diluted in water, and then orange, and then. they just grab the cups and they just play with it and try to fill different ones with different... So it's like they learn. the life skill of pouring is what it's for.. - Did they do it well? - Oh yeah yeah yeah, and. they were super entertained because they never done it before so they were there for. solid 15, 20 minutes. Like, you know, doing that. And of course they were. drinking it and all that. - Oh they were? (laughs) - Yeah but it's water, so it's fine. And it's food coloring,. so, but it was a lot of fun so I need to get more food coloring. So anyways, this is for adults. and kids, it's the same. - Okay, okay. - Yeah, like, I will give it, you know. A lot of people, and. we try to do the same, at the beginning we do. more purees and things that are just for them, but right now I want them to eat what we eat. The thing is sometimes. we eat like bunnies. Just a bunch of salads. (laughs) We do other things! So, do you want me to go. through the ingredients? - Yes! - Okay, so. - And does this have a name? - This is a name called Acai Bowl. So this is acai, which is a fruit. But this is frozen. - Okay. - Okay, and you can get this. at any grocery store, so. - And the tip is, let's give. them a tip on this banana. - Well, our sous chef,. not her as my sous chef, Our other sous chef was holding. the phone (Claudia laughs) I forgot to tell him to, you have to freeze the. bananas already peeled. - Yes. - So you are not struggling. like Paula is. (laughs) So when you're gonna use frozen bananas, first peel them and then. put them in the freezer. You can put them in a bowl, or. in a Ziploc bag or whatever. - Okay, well I've never tried. to peel a frozen banana. - You did a great job. - So, (laughing) oh well. thank you, it's pretty messy. - No it looked pretty good. - [Paula] You know those. strings on a banana. - Yeah, I guess they were not that frozen. - [Paula] Holy moly I. couldn't get them off! - Yeah. There it is. That's good.. - [Paula] Okeydoke! - You can get the string. So anyways.. - [Paula] All right, so what were you saying then Claudia? - [Claudia] So this, we're. not using brands right? (Claudia laughs) Bobby every time I say. something he's like, you're doing free. advertising for everyone. I'm like, what that's what I use! (laughs) I like to share the tips of what I use. So anyways. - Well I do too. - Yeah, I mean, doesn't matter. So these acai packs, you can. find them at any grocery store in the frozen section where. the frozen fruits are. - I actually have some in the freezer. - Yeah, I'll be curious to see because... We've made the mistake before of getting the one that is. sweetened, that has sugar and you wanna get, especially. if it's for the kids because this is already. gonna be sweet enough with the banana, you. wanna get the unsweetened. Unsweetened, so always. look at the packages. And make sure that it's unsweetened. So, these are pretty. rough, so what we do first is we're gonna blend these guys first, before we do the banana. So, we're gonna cut it,. with these scissors, that I'm sure is not yours, it's probably one of the kids too. (both laughing) These scissors,. - Oh no, - It's yours?. - I just like that size! - Really?. - Yes. - That's funny. - Yes I just like that size. - Okay, and this blender. - And I use those more than any. other scissors in my drawer. - That's funny. This is a very powerful. blender, already we've seen. - Oh, I'm telling you. It's gonna sound like a rocket going off. - Yeah, sometimes if I,. let's say I freeze them, and then I take them out. for a little bit before you can run them under hot water if you don't have a high speed blender. And sometimes I like. chopping them a little bit before putting them in. there, so it's already... Okay, there we go, now, Miss. Paula is gonna blend it. - Okay. All right let's see, this one has to be. - [Claudia] We're new with this gadget. - Uh-huh. (Blender roars) If you can't mix with. this thing, you can't mix. - How do you open it though? - Just take your top off. - I think I'm gonna break it. I don't wanna upset. Michael, broke his blender. - We're not gonna break it. - You sure? (Blender lid pops). Okay. Oh that's pretty, oh. wow, that is pretty good. - Yeah! - Look. - That thing don't play. - Yeah, wow, this is serious- - Look how many blades. - That's what I was gonna. say, it has like ten blades. - (laughs) Yes. - So you need two of those packages and then two frozen bananas and the more you say riped, or ripened? - Huh? - Riped bananas? - Ripe. - Ripe bananas. - Peeled bananas. - Peeled, peeled, very important. And the more ripe they are, of course the sweeter. they're gonna be, so. You want them to be really riped. - How about, I make my banana nut bread out of over, over ripe bananas. - Oh yeah, it's just sugar. It's just gonna taste even sweeter. - [Paula] Would you want them, could you make this with. really over, over ripe? - Yeah, like that guy over there. Like this, - Like this one? - That one, or even more! - [Paula] All right, how about this one? - Yeah, yeah. - You could? - Oh yeah, that's why, every. time my bananas start turning - Okay so another way to use. old bananas besides just making bread, yeah.. - Banana bread, yeah. And a lot of the times what I do when my, any fruit and even vegetables, when they're turning super ugly I just put them in the freezer and then I put them in smoothies like spinach, when it starts. getting mushy and ugh. I'll just put them in the freezer and then I put them in smoothies. - I mean we have to. - And it's great. - Get this top. - Yeah. - Just right. (Blender roars) Okay y'all, it's ready,. just two ingredients! - Yeah, see how easy, and simple! And delicious.. - What's all that stuff in those jars? - Well that's the fun part. - [Paula] Oh, okay! So we're gonna get. - [Claudia] This is the boring part. - [Paula] Oh okay. - [Claudia] We'll get to the fun part. (Bowls Sliding) - [Paula] So we're gonna get something. - [Claudia] Yes. Oh, that's what I'm nervous. Is it not gonna. - [Paula] Don't be nervous.. - [Claudia] Go down here? - [Paula] I don't think? - [Claudia] Oh shoot. - [Paula] No. - Oh wow, this is something else. - Uh-huh, look at those blades. - Yeah, that's insane. So you've got your delicious, - Uh-huh. - You're really close to. me, I'm like. (laughs) - Hello..

I want my own.. - [Paula] Give me a small one. Do me a small one. - [Claudia] Paula's like,.

So easy.. - [Paula] I'm gonna take aunt Peggy some back there. - [Claudia] Oh yeah,. you can give her mine. Okay, so.. - [Paula] I'll give her mine. - [Claudia] Okay, so. then comes the fun part. So you can decorate this. with whatever you want and I think this will be. fun if you have older kids because then you can involve them in doing the fun decoration part. So we are gonna cut this,. can we cut here now? We need a cutting? - Yes, no, you can cut there. - Okay, so. - And there's your knife. - My knife, oh, it's. the Deen Brothers knife. - (laughs) Yes it is. - So I like the strawberries. You can do, I mean,. literally whatever you want. This is just what we had. And these strawberries. are really good lately. I thought you wanted a small one. - It's so good and cold and refreshing. I got to give the cameraman some. - So you can decorate. it, well, you're still- - Did you like it? - That's pretty but.. - [Eddie] Yeah, very good. - Then you're supposed. to go, with the camera. - With the camera? (Claudia laughs) - If you don't like it you go. (laughs) - And then we're gonna do bananas. - Oh some more banana. - Yes, bananas are life.. - But what about those jars? - Oh we'll go there. - Oh okay. (laughs) - Patience, we need to learn. - I feel - To be patient.. - Like I'm, - I'm missing something. - Here, you can grab the. bananas that you want. - Okay. - So this is a very cute bowl, small bowl. Okay, try that one. - [Paula] Oh thank you. - [Claudia] And then, we. have the magic powders. So, what we have, I don't. know why I have this because we're not gonna use. it, unless you want to, but. This is flaxseeds. (laughs) - [Paula] Well. - [Claudia] Do it, do it. It doesn't taste like. anything, it's just fiber. - [Paula] No it doesn't, how much? - [Claudia] That's great,. and just sprinkle it. Yes, I'll put it all. around mine too just so. Chia seeds, they have a lot of- - Yeah I like chia seeds. - Omegas and, there we go. - How much?. - They're great. How much, as much as you want. That's the fun part you. can do whatever you want. And then hemp seeds, they. have a lot of protein. So, we want the protein. - How much? - How much, as much as you want. So I always tell the kids, and I always like to. do this, just an idea. I always like to tell. them what they're eating, so every time they're. eating, I start saying okay we're gonna eat this for example and I'm like okay, it has. bananas, and it has strawberries which are full of vitamins and minerals and they're great for your health and the banana has a lot of potassium so we don't get dehydrated and then I'll go like, and I also put, we're. also gonna have hemp seeds that have a lot of. protein for your muscles so you can grow strong,. they're one and a half but I- - That's all right, if you. talk to them like an adult and explain things, you're. so far ahead of the game. - Yeah I know they'll understand, and I told them, and this has flaxseeds! (laughs) And that is granola. - y'all went out in. the yard the other day. - Oh yeah. - Tell me how much. - I like it, so a lot,. I mean, not a lot, but. That's good so they can. see the final product. - [Paula] Okay. This looks like something that I would like a whole lot. (laughs) - [Claudia] Yeah it's delicious. Look, look how pretty they look. - [Paula] Yes, they do. - [Claudia] See? - [Paula] It's very. appetizing looking Claud. - [Claudia] It's very simple. - [Paula] I don't know how much y'all know about my daughter-in-law, but... - Other than that I'm a. great daughter-in-law, and a great mother and great wife? - Mm-hm other than that,. she is a triathlete. - Well, you're like Bobby, always... - She is a life coach, she is available for. people that need help, and guidance, I mean she's just a wealth wealth of knowledge, about. foods and what they do for you, or what they don't do. for you. (Claudia laughs) So I trust you. I trust you. - So this will. - Feeding my babies.. - Do a lot for you. Oh yes. - Okay, cheers.. (bowls clink) - Cheers. - Bon appetit! (Claudia laughs) - Mm.. - Mm, mm-hm. - It's really good and really. refreshing. It's delicious. - Where did that crunch stuff go? - Ah, see, that's the best part. (laughs) I like the different textures of things. You gotta put in granola. and fruits and stuff. And again you can put whatever you want. (Paula laughs) This is something that. everybody will like. It's good, right? - I feel so healthy! - I'll come feed you,. I'll come feed you too. - You'll come...? - Feed you! - Oh, feed me! (laughs) I wish I could just move in over there and let you tell me what I. can eat and what I can't eat. - Approved by Paula, so. - All right, we got some more recipes that we're gonna do today don't we?

CsEIKGdqtb4.json;"- I am gonna share with y'all today, or I'm gonna try to. share with y'all today, a dish that I love so much. Souffles. And I had asked my friends. at my magazine, you know, if they would please. put in a souffle recipe. Well, they did. And it's in this issue. This is on the stand right now. Isn't it, y'all? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. It's the-. - ""Southern Suppers""? - [Theresa] Mm-hm. - Well, this is what I'm. gonna prepare for us, a lemon souffle. So I wanna tell y'all... All right, now. The recipe calls for. you to take your brush and brush the butter using. bottom-to-top strokes. I don't know what difference that makes, but I'm doing what they say. 'Cause it's been years, honey. In fact, Art Smith has a restaurant in Washington. He has one somewhere else too. And I can't remember the name of it, but one time I was up in Washington, DC, and we went to his restaurant, but he also had us to his. house, Michael and me, for dinner, and, oh, it a wonderful dinner. I can't remember exactly what he prepared, but it was delicious. And after we got through eating, he jumped up and started doing... I said, Art, what in the. world are you doing now? He said, well, I got,. I'm making our dessert. And I said, oh, what is it? And he said, a lemon souffle. Well, honey, it was all I could do not to ram my tongue down. in that dish and lick it. So if y'all ever get a chance to go to one of Art Smith's restaurants, you need to do that. All right. So. I have taken my dish and buttered it. Now I'm going very gently try to... shake some sugar in there. And I'm just gonna try. to beat off the excess. So it's kind of like, you know, shortening and flour in a pound cake. All right. So let's see. There we go. Okay, so our dish is ready. And now our next step is... Art made this look so simple, y'all. He had this thing... He had us eatin' souffle in 20 minutes. It was so quick. - [Theresa] Do you think you're gonna have it done in 20 minutes? - No. (Paula chuckling) No! All right. I'm gonna take my flour, my sugar, and my salt. And I'm gonna sift that using my whisk. And this whisk acts almost like a sifter. All right. And the next thing I'm gonna put in is about a fourth of a cup of milk. Maybe a little bit more than that. And I'm gonna whisk this together. You know, you can make. savory souffles too, but honey, given a choice, I. want a sweet souffle, please. Please. All right, now the next thing I'm gonna do is add our four egg yolks. And while I'm doing that,. I'm gonna come over here, and I'm gonna put a cup. of milk in our saucepan. And I'm gonna turn that on. kind of more to the low side. And I don't wanna boil. this, but I wanna scald it. So scalding is just when you're... The rim is about to start bubbling. So I'm gonna beat this until. it's smooth as I can get it. (Paula beating eggs) Okay. That looks pretty. smooth, doesn't it? That looks smooth to me. Okie doke. And now we just gonna wait for this to come to a scalding stage, and then we're gonna mix. this thing all together. We're gonna put it in the oven, and it's gonna be fabulous. I hope! (Paula laughing) Our milk is scalded. You know, it wasn't boiling, but you can see where it started. bubbling around the edges. So I'm gonna pour about. half of this hot milk into our flour mixture. (Paula beating the eggs) And it's like, we kind. of tempering those eggs, because we don't want scrambled, lemon scrambled eggs. All right, just a little bit more. And now we're gonna put. this back into the pot with the rest of the hot milk. How about this? (Paula chuckling) I'm gettin' my exercise. Make sure... that I get every drop of this out. And now to this. I'm gonna add my lemon zest. Mm. Ooh, it smells so good. Mm, mm, mm. I'm gonna add my lemon juice. And my butter. It's not much butter for souffles, y'all. (Paula turning on a gas burner) All right, and I'm gonna continue to cook this just until. it starts to thicken. I've got the egg whites from my four... eggs that we separated. Now, I'm going to plug this in. (Paula chuckling) I almost didn't remember. to plug it in, Theresa. All right, let's see. Okay. (mixer whirring) How are you looking, girlie? - [Theresa] I'm looking good. Don't forget your cream of tartar. I think it tells you to. add that to the egg whites. - Yeah. All right. Let me see. (mixer whirring) Yes. They want 'em all together. So that's like a fourth a teaspoon of cream of tartar. And our instructions. say to whip it on low. (mixer whirring) And then go to high. (beaters hitting side of the bowl) I'm gonna kind of slowly add. my sugar to my egg whites. Now, it's important when. you're making a merengue to make sure your beaters. are spotlessly clean and your bowl. Because if there's anything that can get in those egg whites, they will play with it and mess it up. (beaters hitting the side of the bowl) Now in the recipe, it will tell you, if you over-beat your egg whites, there's a good chance that. your souffle won't make, so you just don't wanna. beat them until they're dry, but you do wanna beat 'em. until it forms stiff peaks. Okay, we're down to the last step. And it seems like it's taken me an awfully long time to do this. But I think once I've done it, in the recent past, that I won't be as slow with it next time. All right, so I'm gonna add about one cup of our merengue into our custard. And I'm gonna just try to do this gently until it's completely combined. Now, if this doesn't turn out, y'all, I'm gonna show it to you anyway. (Paula chuckling) Because this is not trick-you cooking. I don't want to try to trick anybody. All right, I think that's. completely combined. Now we're just gonna put. the rest of it in there. These egg whites look beautiful. And then I'm just gonna gently fold... them into the... (spoon rapping against the bowl) into the rest of the custard mix. (spoon rapping against bowl's edge) And the fold, it's down. and over, down and over, down and over. I think it's good. - [Theresa] I have faith that. this is gonna be fabulous. - [Paula] I hope. - [Theresa] What do you think, Eddie? - [Eddie] Looks good. Looks... - [Paula] Eddie's smart. He's not gonna commit yet. (Paula laughing) - [Eddie] I'll eat it. - [Theresa] I trust that magazine. - [Eddie] Whether it rises or not. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] I'm with you, Eddie. (spoon rapping against bowl's edge) - [Theresa] I'm gonna trust the magazine. - Oh. If it doesn't rise, I will rise to the. occasion and eat it anyway. (Paula chuckling) How about that? Okay. And you wanna make. sure that rim is clean. All right, so it's ready to go. And it says to bake this. for 30 to 35 minutes on 350. Oh! To the souffle gods. Please let this work. If it doesn't, I'm eatin' it anyway. (Paula chuckling) I think, I think it's done, Eddie. Uh, but it did not rise. It started to. It wanted to. Right there. But like I said, it's. just been a long time. So... It's back to the drawing. board for old Paula. (Paula chuckling ruefully) But I say it's still gonna be good. Look at that. You want it like puddin' in the center. - [Eddie] Looks good. - Doesn't it look delicious? And you know what, y'all? I forgot. I wanted to make an. anglaise to pour over it when I served everybody a bowlful, and I forgot. Mm. Mm! - [Eddie] I don't think. I've ever had a souffle. Is it like angel food? - [Theresa] Oh, no. - Uh-uh. It's like... It's like that. I really, really, really. love it so much better with an anglaise. And an anglaise is just. like a cooked custard. You know, and then you just. pour it on top of your souffle, and, honey, it will not your socks off. - [Theresa] Let me tell you, that is good. (Paula chuckling). And I've had souffles. - Well. - I've had lots of souffles. That's good.. - Mm. Well, y'all, eat up. I still got to work on it some more. And next time, I want to do. mine like Art did in the... See, it's kind of got a puddin'-y center? - [Eddie] So, I mean, do. you, can you eat it cold too? - Yeah, I guess you could, but... - [Eddie] You're supposed to eat it hot. - [Theresa] It's a hot.. - Yeah. - I mean, you're supposed to take it right out of the oven and... - Just like what I'm doing. - Yeah. Dip it. And then like she said, a lot of 'em will have, like, you'll pour something right on top or in the middle of it.. - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Oh, they're so good. But I think that is a good, I mean that... I think there's something. wrong with our dish, to be honest. - For being a long time, it's not bad. - [Theresa] Uh-uh. - So, really, it's so good. Mm. But, you could see where it wanted to start puffing up right there, but it should have been like that high. Mm, mm! I'm double dippin'. (Paula chuckling) Love y'all. Love and best dishes.";['postres']
cTjzXnErmVg.json;"- Hey, y'all. Over the years, there have. been a few recipes that, I don't care what piece. of the country I'm in, somebody's gonna say something. about a certain recipe. Well, this is one of those recipes. And you talk about easy, easy, easy, and it's my orange. blossoms or lemon blossoms. And the recipe was in, I. think, my second cookbook, ""The Lady & Sons, Too!"" And I know that it's also in. the ""Kitchen Classics"" book. So you can make an orange blossom, which is the recipe here in the book, but I'm gonna make lemon blossoms in the little miniature cups. And you're just not gonna. believe how good these are. And I'm starting with a cake mix, y'all. And I have instructions (package rustling) in the recipe as to how to put the cake together. And it's real simple, too. One yellow cake mix, one small box of lemon instant pudding, and let's see, I've got 3/4 a cup of oil, and 3/4 a cup of water. So I think that's pretty much what it said on the box, didn't it Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - Some cake mixes call. for softened butter, some call for oil. So, I just like the way oil, how it reacts with the cake mix. It just makes it very, very moist. All right, so we just. gonna mix this up good. We gonna beat beat it. for a couple of minutes and now I'm gonna add my eggs. Kind of one at a time. (mixer whirs) And, you don't wanna use, you don't wanna use the. little muffin liners for this recipe, because after we bake 'em off, they gonna be taken a wonderful bath. All right. So on with our lemon blossoms. All right, I'm gonna wanna make sure, these are nonstick pans, but I wanna make sure that. I spray 'em real, real good because we don't want any sticking. (cooking spray fizzes) and I'm using the (cooking spray fizzes) (pan clatters) the spray that has flour in it also, so it's really good to. keep it from sticking. So every time I go look. for something, y'all (Paula chuckling) I have to remember that we're. not living in our house, we're living in Bobby's house (chuckling) and my stuff is in storage. (chuckling) So, you wanna make sure. that your muffin tins are filled exactly even. Now, I've sprayed this. I sprayed this so that. our batter will come out and I'm using about a tablespoon per hole 'cause, like I said, we wanna make sure they all get cooked at the same time. So I'm not gonna ask y'all to watch this. This is like watching paint dry. - [Michael] Why do they call it badder? They shoulda called it gooder. (Paula laughing) - Now y'all see what I live with? He thinks of all this crazy. stuff that I never think of. But it's like his little. mind never stops. (chuckling) He thinks up the goofiest stuff. Well, it's batter, not better. See, if it was called better, I'm like you, I would. question it, but it's batter. - [Michael] Yeah, like bad, badder. (Paula chuckling) - But it's actually gooder. (chuckling) Okay, we've got all the tins filled and it's actually gonna. make about four dozen. You know, it could vary a little bit, depending on how full. you filled your cups. So, in the oven they go. (pan clatters) Gosh, I can't remember how. long I normally bake these, but I had the oven preheated at 325. And let's see what I said,. bake for 10 to 12 minutes. So while those are baking, I'm going to, you know, I told you they. was gonna get a bath, so I'll show you what. they gonna be bathing in. And I'm gonna go back to my cookbook and refer to measurements. All right, for our glaze, we've got three cups of. confectioner's sugar, 1/2 a cup. Where'd I put it? Oh. I put it over here in Michael's area. So I'm gonna add 1/2 a cup. of concentrated lemonade. You know, the frozen little. containers of lemonade? I'm using 1/2 a cup. Now, if we were making. the orange blossoms, I would be doing orange juice. And I'm adding three. tablespoons of melted butter. (bowl clatters) And I'm gonna need three. tablespoons of water. (water splashing) So, it's all pretty easy. What I'd do with my? Oh, there it is. (water splashing) How you coming with your tuna fish? - [Michael] Good, it's. almost a egg salad tuna fish. - All right, it's hard to fill up a- - [Eddie] Egg salad tuna fish. (Michael laughing) (spoon clinking) Paula, maybe you and Michael can reenact what's going on on your. shirt after this episode? - Oh! (laughing) Listen, I was with the. triplets this morning and you know how much they. love ballerinas, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - And I had some ballerina. pillows made for their cribs for the two girls, not Linton. And I walked up to 'em and they said, ""Ah, Guinea, ballerinas, ballerinas."" Even Linton was saying,. ""Guinea, Guinea, ballerinas. Senor, senor."" (laughing) Talking about the man. I said, ""Well, that's. Patrick Swayze, baby."" Or is it Peepaw? (laughing) - [Michael] Hell of a resemblance. - And is this Guinea? Y'all, I loved, loved,. loved, ""Dirty Dancing."" I swear to you, I have seen it, I know, at least a hundred times. Every time I see it on, I. stop, sit down, and watch it. Because I just thought. it was just wonderful. And (dishes clattering) so Teri, my friend that owns what, A Little Piece of Heaven? - [Eddie] A Little Bit of Heaven. - A Little Bit of Heaven, the bakery, you know, she did a show. with me, a video with me. She was showing us how. to make the cocoa bombs. Well she went up to the lodge where ""Dirty Dancing"" was actually filmed. And so while she was there, she bought me a ""Dirty Dancing"" t-shirt. And Teri, I have to tell ya, I don't know who loves it the most, my grandchildren or me. (chuckling) So every time I wear it,. I'll think about you girl, and just cross my fingers. that ""Dirty Dancing"" will come on for the 2000th time, 'cause I will be watching it. All right, so I've got the timer set (whisk whumping) for 10 to 12 minutes, and I'm gonna run back over. the measurements of this real quick like. It's three cups of confectioner's sugar, 1/2 a cup of frozen lemonade. concentrate, thawed, three tablespoons of melted butter, and three tablespoons of water. So when our lemon blossoms come out, we're gonna immediately dip. 'em into their sugar bath. And (dishes clattering) I confess, in the recipe, I instruct everybody to dip 'em once, but I let 'em dry and I dip 'em twice. So I may have to make up more batter, but I just love the way it soaks up that frosting-like stuff. (chuckles) So, I'll see you in 10. (water splashing) Okay, so here we go, y'all. These made four dozen,. and I just told Eddie, I said, ""You know, it's been. a while since I made 'em, and I really filled my. little cups too full."" So, it probably would make five dozen. You know, if I hadn't a been. so eager to fill 'em so full. (pan clatters) All right, so I'm gonna. bring 'em over here. (whisk tapping) And like I said, it's been a long time since I've made these, so I'm gonna see which. is gonna be the best. To fork it, or tongue it. I think maybe fork it. And I'm definitely gonna have to make some more frosting up, Eddie, if I do 'em twice. You just won't believe how good these are. You know, I have to tell y'all this, to my knowledge, they used to make a box lemon cake mix and it was good. But then all of a sudden it changed and it was so artificial tasting. So y'all please don't think. you can use a yellow cake mix. You know, it's- - [Eddie] A lemon cake mix? - What did I say? - [Eddie] A yellow. - Yeah, (laughing) a yellow. A lemon cake mix, I. would not recommend that. I would stick with the yellow and the lemon or orange. jello pudding. (chuckling) Look at that, look at that. Yum. So here we are friends, a. double-dipped lemon blossom. So delicious, so easy to make, but look at the mess we made, Eddie. Look over there at our mess. (laughing) But you're not supposed to look at that, you're just supposed to look. at this beautiful plate. And speaking of this plate, my best friend, Bubbles,. Susan, Susan Green, and Phil, her husband,. came over last weekend to bring Aunt Peggy here for. her doctor's appointment. And Susan's mother is 94 years old. This beautiful crystal dish was. given to her on her wedding. It was a wedding gift and she's 94. And Susan asked if I would like it. And I said, ""Oh my gosh, yes."" So, it's probably 75 years old, right Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah. I would assume she probably got married in her early twenties. - Yeah, well this means. so much to me, this dish. I don't know how Susan parted with it, but she has probably got. things like this out her ears because her mother never. got rid of a thing. She was a little rat pack. (chuckling) So look how beautiful, Susan. Thank you, Bubbles. I wish I could send you one. And I just love my dish, it reminds me of my grandmother. Paul's, that I treasure. It's much like this. Same shape, different little handle. But I hope y'all enjoy this. And in the cookbook, and maybe on the web, it's gonna come up orange blossoms. So just change it all out. And I did, (chuckles) I did double my glaze recipe 'cause most folks. probably wouldn't have 'em this coated, but I like it that way. - [Eddie] You're not gonna take a bite? - Huh? - [Eddie] You're not gonna take a bite? - You want me to take a bite? I've already eaten one, Eddie. (laughing) I'm gonna put these over here. I'm gonna eat so many. of these things, y'all, it's gonna be sickening. And poor Michael's gonna have. to sit there and watch me. You know, I gotta get. my butt on a diet, too. I can't stand the thoughts. of him getting skinny and me staying fat and fluffy. (laughing) Love and best dishes, y'all. And I will see y'all later.";['postres']
CxBC6aaZIFU.json;(soft music) All right, let's move. on to an old fashioned sweet potato pie, I adore sweet potatoes. Into our two cups of sweet potatoes I'm gonna add a cup of sugar and two eggs and then we're just going to. beat this with a hand mixer until it's nice and mixed up. And these eggs are gonna. make those sweet potatoes like set up and they're. gonna be so delicious. All right, to our sweet. potatoes and sugar and eggs, I'm gonna add a teaspoon. of vanilla flavoring and a half a stick of melted butter. Put in a quarter of a. teaspoon of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and we're just gonna blend these together. And then we're going to. slowly add one cup of milk and for today's pie I'm gonna. cheat and go the easy way with a frozen pie crust. If you're having baked. sweet potatoes for dinner and you've got them left over, make sure you have a sweet. potato pie the next night. I like that so much. better than boiling them. When you boil them, the water kind of breaks. down the strength. So this is just straight. potatoes baked in the oven. Now we're just gonna pour. this in our pie crust. I have this on a sheet, just in case it makes. a mess and runs over, it'll all be caught on the sheet. It's really so good. So we're gonna put this. in the oven at 350. All right, so that'll be. ready in about 35 minutes. And there's nothing better.. - Hey Mom! - Hey, there's nothing better than a sweet potato pie.. - I'm hungry. You got two sons. - Sweet potato pie with meringue on it. - I didn't get any soup. - Well listen son, I didn't. know where you were and listen, nuh-uh, I tell you what your. brother sang for his supper. You sing for years now. No (laughs). - You want me to cook, not sing. - I've heard you sing, son. Finish making this meringue,. now just beat those. - Okay.. - Until they're soft peaks and slowly add the sugar and I'm gonna be cleaning up. - This doesn't look like potato soup with cheese and bacon on it. - And then you can have. some soup, how's that? I just wanna get this mess cleaned up. All right let's get your sugar in there, we want this to turn into meringue. I've cooked a couple of pies Jamie and I've got one in the oven and this one is cooled and ready, let me show you how. - Show me how. - Sometimes he got a treat it rough. Slap it around a little bit. - I'm familiar. - What is that supposed to mean? You better love me, you better love me. - [Jamie] So you want me to top this? - [Paula] Yeah. But this is so, so good. You know, lots of times I'll serve, I'll serve my pumpkin. pies with heavy cream, you know, sweetened whipped cream. But you know, this is a nice change. And the one thing you'll. want to make sure son, I'm sure you know this, but when you're meringuing your pies, you wanna really seal edges good because the syrup from the meringue will - Bubble over?. - Well yeah, it'll cause the meringue to pull away. - You want me to put. that in the oven for ya? - Yeah, we'll put this in. the oven and let it bake for oh 10 or 12 minutes,. something like that. Guys! I got y'all some pie ready. - Oh!. - Pie! - Oh!. - Pie. - Pie.. - Pie. - Pie.. - Pie. - Pie.. - Pie. - Pie, pie, pie.. - Pie, pie, pie! Where's mine? (Paula laughing) - I've raised a couple of nuts, y'all. All right, there's your piece of pie son. Here's your piece of pie.. - Mmm. And did y'all take, is it good? - Mmm, that's so wonderful. - Good! I wanna have some with you. And until next time y'all, the boys and I wish y'all. best dishes and love from our tater kitchen to yours.;['postres']
dhsDxLxpFpA.json;good morning y'all another uh quarantine cooking school going on this morning you know i've had so many um so many letters and requests from people to say paula please don't stop these when the quarantine is up uh because we just it just makes our day to have these to watch so you know what i think that's probably something that i can almost promise you that i'm i'm not gonna quit i'm not gonna quit doing them even after things get back to normal because i've had way too much fun i get so much correspondence from y'all and just hearing you talk in fact the recipe i'm gonna share today y'all uh a request came in from a couple out of bluffton south carolina which is just right over the talmadge bridge and it's from steve and mary ball and they sent me the sweetest card it was just so sweet and so encouraging and you know it just makes whatever work i do it just makes it worthwhile to hear uh that i've made somebody smile made them happy so that's great um so anyway they wanted to know if i would show everybody the recipe for grand girls fresh apple cake from georgia and if you like apples this is truly a wonderful cake and it's a cake where you don't even have to pull out the mixer and uh the recipe says to add all the ingredients in the order that they're given um just add those in the bowl so we're gonna start with sugar now there'll be a link where you can go online and find this recipe but um i'll try to tell you the measurements too as we go in case you're writing them down all right the first ingredient to go in is two cups of sugar three eggs how much y'all let's see what that says yes a cup and a half of vegetable oil this one's kind of hard to read isn't it eddie but it's a cup and a half and all those other numbers only i have no idea what they mean i found the biggest biggest picture yes it's great that like millimeters i don't know about those kind of words all right we got some orange juice and i think maybe a half a cup no it says a quarter of a cup that looks more than a quarter doesn't it let's just see it's a quarter of a cup how could i doubt uh eddie and teresa's measurements i don't think so all right then the next thing we're gonna do is add a flower but i'm going to incorporate this a little bit you know i just love making these kind of cakes that don't require a a big old mixer it just really makes it just a little easier and you're not gonna believe how good this cake is gonna taste and i love a cake made with oil if a recipe calls for all you can bet your bottom dollar that it's gonna be really moist all right so add our flour and i think it's three cups yes it's three cups of all-purpose flour and i think it's two teaspoons one teaspoon of baking soda soda soda that kind of stuck in there get all that out and let's see how much cinnamon one tablespoon of cinnamon and one tablespoon i think it looks like a tablespoon of vanilla yes it is okay so we're just gonna keep mixing this up and then we've got the apples to add to it and coconut and nuts my favorite nut a pecan this cake is it's kind of very very oops i forgot to the salt it wasn't in its right place let's see a fourth of a teaspoon of salt but i usually use in sweet recipes a little bit more salt uh than the recipe calls for because i just like that uh little sweet and kind of savory you know that you get see how easy that was y'all we we have just about got this thing ready to go into the oven and i've got our oven preheating at 325 and uh okay so it calls for three cups of peeled and chopped rather on the fine side of apples and i can't remember what kind of apples i bought but they're cooking apples i think these were golden delicious that's what it said on the tack okay i can't remember there's so many apples out there that are available to us now they they just um mate so many apples now and come up with a new strand and some are better for cooking because i've got a in fact i bought my apples for another recipe that i wanted to share with y'all but so i'm gonna be making that very soon but it's with apples all right now let's see one cup of coconut and one cup of chopped pecans okay now that coconut is gonna uh make this cake so moist along with the apple so you got your all your apples and your coconut that you know it's really really those three things are gonna make a wonderful moist cake plus after the cake comes out of the oven y'all we're gonna put a sauce on it and let it run down in there and i'm telling you when we get through we could almost put this in a glass and drink it okay turn when you have to when you get rid of that mix ready it makes it so much easier all right so i'm gonna put this in a bundt pan and um you want it well well greased because there's nothing any worse than and go into the trouble and the expense of making a great cake and then it won't come out of the pan so i think we've got that one sprayed good enough all right whoa eddie you want to turn my pan for me honey yes yes yes and this is uh in your kitchen classic yes it's in kitchen classics but it may have been first in my second cookbook the lady and sons 2 and then the classics you know i hate to say it's my favorite but um the classics cookbook is a combination of my first and second book together which makes it so great because i didn't have to remember which book it was in the first or the second one plus it's um got wedding photos and the recipes or all the things that we served in our wedding reception all those recipes so it's classics just i don't know classics are just hard to beat period aren't they this pan sure does look full doesn't it hope it doesn't bake out i think i'm gonna put it on a cookie sheet to just make sure so it will have a little mess as we can possibly have all right so we're going to bake this cake y'all for one and a half hours so which means we're gonna take a break right here and then after an hour and a half yeah an hour and a half we'll come back and i'll share with y'all the recipe for the topping that we're gonna pour all over this wonderful cake so see you in two maybe two hours hour and a half hour and 45 minutes anyway you'll be amazed at how fast time flies okay y'all our uh grand girls apple cake from georgia i just took out the oven it's piping hot so here we go steve and mary now the topping we are gonna um cook it for just a minute we're gonna melt that butter and then we're gonna add sugar buttermilk and soda and we're gonna pour it over this cake y'all and we're gonna let it sit for one hour and then we're gonna turn it out on a pretty cake pan and uh it's gonna be hard to let it sit for an hour but y'all are just gonna have to trust me i can't sit here for an hour waiting for it to get ready so i can taste it to prove it to you but you just take my word now in fact you take steve and mary ball's word because they know how good it is all right so milk butter okay so our butter's melted now i'm gonna add our sugar and we're gonna let this come to a rolling ball y'all for about one minute and i'm gonna put in the baking soda and the buttermilk there's something about buttermilk and soda you know i'm no scientist but does anybody over at that table know no i don't but there's something there's something about soda and buttermilk that does this magic stuff so a rolling ball for about a minute i make a fig cake and that food cake eddie has a very very similar topping doesn't it yes it's the buttermilk and the butter oh my goodness i think it's identical so this would be great on any cake but you just want that sugar to dissolve all right ball baby bowl you know they say watch pot never balls it's only when you turn your back it doesn't ball over there we go it's starting to fall i think that's been long enough the main thing you want you just want that sugar dissolved all right so here we go and i just took the cake out of the oven y'all and you know what i think i think that i want to put some holes in that cake [Music] this is michael's meat thermometer and it'll make great holes for that sauce to run in there just poke it all around around there okay here we go again that'll help that absorb into the cake a little bit quicker i don't want to lose any of that sauce to the to that hole in the center of the cake i'm gonna have to look up that fig cake in fact um i found that a friend had told me about a fig cake that her mother used to make and she gave me the recipe and one day i was just sitting around reading my brother's cookbook i don't see it now but it had the fig cake recipe in it so bubble was onto that cake long before i was so i'm gonna look that up and see if that's not the identical what lulu okay so steve and mary the hardest thing about this cake is waiting that one hour so thank you so much for that beautiful card that y'all sent me and all the sweet precious words that were in it loving best dishes y'all hey y'all it's paula dean now if

DKX_nB3LF_4.json;- Y'all I'm fixing to share with you a recipe that I mean, it goes back a long way. It was- it might have even been. in my first cookbook, but I know it's in this cookbook because I'm reading it and the name of 'em- and people love them. And they're so simple. They're called orange blossoms. Now, you can do a lemon blossom or you can do an orange blossom. So, today I've just been in the mood, I don't know if you've. heard me say, Eddie, I wanted something orange, you know, citrusy and orangey. So, I'm gonna make my own public decision to make these orange. Alright, so I'm gonna go. ahead and make our glaze so it can be sittin' and waitin' on us. So, now for the glaze I need three cups of confectioner's sugar, a half a cup of fresh orange juice. Now, if you've got frozen orange juice, I would just use three tablespoons out of the frozen because. that's concentrate. So, it's gonna make it nice and orangey. All right, let's see. I need three tablespoons of melted butter and three tablespoons of water. So, three tablespoons of water and I'm gonna need to. melt a little butter. You know what? I think oil would be good. Don't you Eddie? So let's do- there I go changing my own recipes. (laughing) Don't fear, Eddie. No fear. 1, 2, 3 tablespoons of oil and I am gonna zest. Let me wash this orange. (water running) I'm going to just zest 'em, some zest to go in our glaze. (orange scraping) Yes. You're gonna want every drop of it. All right. Now, I also- do we have this in the stores, Eddie? - [Eddie] I'm not sure that the orange is, I think you've got almond, vanilla. - Yeah, we've got- - [Eddie] Peppermint and lemon. - Yeah, we've got some wonderful extracts, but even with the orange. juice and the orange rind, I'm gonna put about a. teaspoon of orange flavoring. Smells so good. Right, so I'm gonna give this a stir and I want all this stuff done because when our little. cakes come outta the oven, we gonna have to step. quickly to dip our cakes. 'Cause you have to dip. 'em while they're hot. Oh, I scared my mule. (laughing) Whoa. Now, if it appears too thick you can always add a little. bit more liquid to it. I'm gonna see if that's... The orange is perfect, Eddie. Perfect. I'm gonna give it just a little bit more juice. Get some of that pulp out. Do you like your orange juice pulpless or with pulp, Eddie? - [Eddie] I like a little pulp in it. - I like pulp too. I mean, to me that just. says, ooh, I'm so fresh. We've got our glaze ready. for our orange blossoms and now we're gonna make the little cakes. And this is just really a dump and beat. So, I'm adding four eggs. to our yellow cake mix. You know, they might make an. orange cake mix out there, maybe, I don't know, but I just as soon use yellow and put my own orange flavor to it. Okay, so I'm gonna use about a tablespoon of orange flavoring. Now, if we were making lemon,. we'd use lemon flavoring and then we're gonna add one 3.4 packages of instant jello. Jello puddin'. And this helps make cakes moist. Okay, now we've got a half a cup of water. No, it was three quarters, wasn't it? - [Eddie] Yeah, I think. - Yeah. Three quarters cup of water and three fourths a cup of oil and now we just gonna beat. it for about two minutes and we'll have her done. Now, I'm gonna spray our muffin tins and because we have to dump these as soon as they come out of the oven, we don't have to cool 'em. or let 'em wait or anything, I'm gonna bake these off in batches so I can get to 'em all and they won't have time to cool off. I'm using a non-stick spray that has the flour and the oil in it and you're gonna need about a tablespoon for each little blossom. And these will probably. bake in about 10 minutes. Seems like it's been a. while since I've made these, but it'd be fun. It's kinda like the gooey butter cakes, how many ways can you come. up with to make a blossom? Just a little bit more for that. It's gonna take us a while, Eddie. That's a lot of batter,. but it don't matter. (laughing) Does it? Okay, now we'll do one more and we'll just bake off. two of these at the time. In the oven these go and I'm gonna bake 'em. for 10 to 12 minutes. So, it won't take but a second and then we're gonna bathe 'em in that wonderful confectioner's sugar glaze. They look so pretty, but I made 'em too big. Y'all it's been a long, long. time since I made these. I was just telling Eddie. I wish I had some baker's tweezers. You know, that I could manhandle these with. Now, many a time and y'all can try to act. surprised, but I know you're not but I have been known to double dip. Let 'em cool and then go back in for one more little bath in case I feel like they're. a little on the dirty side. All right, grab you one, Eddie. Grab you one while it's warm. - [Eddie] It is good. - Is good. Just nothing fancy, but people just love. poppin' 'em in their mouth. - [Eddie] It's like eating. a hot Krispy Kreme donut. You see them picking it up for you. - Well, wait, now I got to see. Moo. Moo. Mm, so good. And it's just got that. faint orange taste, Eddie. - [Eddie] Yeah, perfect. - Hmm, mm it's just so easy, y'all. So, like I said, I highly recommend doin'. it in small batches and that way they don't have. time to get cold on you. 'Cause you want 'em to be hot when you bathe them in that glaze. They have it like kind of a bubble bath. But, if I double glaze 'em, I will certainly have. to make some more glaze. So, I may just let one do it this time. Y'all, please try these. Now, take these to the next church social or bridge night with your lady friends or hell, even a beer. party with your buddies. I promise they will like these. Love and best dishes. Hope all your blossoms bloom.;['postres']
dOOy1ZUD1f4.json;"- I can't hardly believe it, friends, but it is time to start. making Christmas cookies. I'm doing them a little. earlier than normal so y'all can have the recipes and get yourself ready for Christmas. I've reached out to y'all and asked if y'all would share your favorite Christmas. cookie recipes with me. I thank y'all, because y'all. really came through for me. Means so much. The first recipe that I'm gonna do today is from Elizabeth Holler. She said, ""I'm a longtime fan, and I saw your request, so I'm sending you our favorite. Christmas cookie recipe."" She said her great Aunt Isa made these, she remembers, probably the. first time 50 years ago, and she said every time she makes 'em, she thinks of Aunt Isa. So it's real, real simple. It's a very simple recipe, but it sounds so very good. I have one cup of solid shortening. I choose to use the butter flavor. Then I've got one 8-ounce. package of cream cheese. Now I'm gonna beat these two together. I'm gonna cream those, and then I'll be back. with you in a second. I beat up my cream. cheese and my shortening. Now I'm gonna add my sugar, and that is one cup. I'm gonna beat that until. it's nice and creamy. To my bowl, I'm gonna add two egg yolks, and that's gonna make it rich, rich, rich. Then after I get this cream together, I'm gonna be adding my two. cups of all-purpose flour with a half a teaspoon. of salt added to it. (mixer whirs) Now I'm gonna add two. teaspoons of vanilla. Vanilla extract. No imitation. - [Teresa] Do you need more? - Perfect. No, that's perfect, Teresa. Thank you. Alright. Now I'm just gonna bring the sides down so we get all that incorporated. Delicious. I love a cookie. - [Teresa] I love cookie dough. - Stick 'em up. (Paula laughs) (mixer whirs) Okay, y'all, Elizabeth said to drop these by the teaspoonful rather than with an ice cream scoop or a butter scoop. So that's what I'm gonna do. She said it just makes a prettier finish if you do it with a teaspoonful. Then we're gonna put 'em in the oven and we're gonna bake. 'em for 10 to 12 minutes at 350 degrees. Beautiful batter. Time to go in the oven. Look at that. See, I got two more extra. cookies out of that, Teresa. - [Teresa] I know. Gosh forbid you leave any in there for someone to have some. cookie dough at the end. (Paula laughs) - I don't think about people wanting to eat the cookie dough. Alright. In the oven, 350, preheated, for 10 to 12 minutes. Thank you, Elizabeth. Okay, it is time to finish up Elizabeth cream cheese cookies. It calls for an icing. Elizabeth said when they cool, just frost with your. favorite buttercream recipe. She said, ""I use..."" This is what Elizabeth uses. So we did exactly the way she does it. We used a stick and a half of butter at room temperature and we mixed it with four. cups of confectioner sugar and two teaspoons of vanilla. We are gonna... Look, it's Christmas time. When you start pulling. out all of this stuff, it's Christmas time. I love going in. This is just a little. piece of them, y'all. Alright. So what are we gonna do here? Should we dye this all? Because I'm gonna do 'em with sprinkles. Definitely, I'm gonna. do 'em with sprinkles. Alright. I'm gonna need a cookie sheet. So I can, so I can catch all those little jimmies that we're gonna be putting on it. Whoa. Watch it, sister. So let's see. Let's do it like this first and then we'll make our decision. You know I love me a frosted cookie. So good with a cup of coffee in the morning. Whoa. - [Teresa] You need help frosting? - Oh, I would just love your help, Teresa. (Paula laughs) No, I wanna do every. one of these by myself. (Paula laughs) One Christmas cookie. So what do you think? Should I add some color to the.. - Well, then you're limited on what colors you can put on your... - I know it, but you know what? I don't think I can resist doing a little purple because Meli loves purple. So I may just scoop out a little. I think my other grandchildren. don't have a preference, just as long as it's sweet. Alright, I've made up a little purple, which is not really Christmasy, but I just happen to know that. that's Meli's favorite color. She loves to wear purple. She loves to eat purple. Now, what color should. we put on with a purple? Maybe the Mardi Gras colors, purple and green. Oh, yeah. I think maybe the pearls, Eddie. You think? - [Eddie] The little... Yeah, the little ones. - [Paula] And look, I'm not stirring that purple in completely good, so I'll have a little, you. know, like a two-tone color. So we decided on the pearls, right? These look like something you would tell your children. not to put in their mouth. Well, doesn't it? Those are awfully pretty. Elizabeth, we all appreciate you sharing your Christmas. cookie recipe with us. They're delicious. Eddie, Eddie likes his without the frosting. He said the flavor is so good just naked. Now does that mean you naked, Eddie? Or the cookie? (Paula laughs) - [Teresa] Don't make him. blush from behind the camera. - [Eddie] I guess I'd. eat 'em naked, I guess. (Paula laughs) - Eddie's so shy and so reserved. Don't you just feel sorry for him, having to spend 24/7 with me? (Paula laughs) So thank you, honey. Look, I just did all kinds, all colors. And y'all remember now, every Christmas I do 12. 12 days of cookies. So y'all are gonna be getting 12 recipes from other folks that we gonna share with. y'all at Christmas time. - [Teresa] And if some people didn't send theirs in this year, please send them in now. - Yes. - So we have them for next year. - [Paula] Yes. Yes. - 'Cause we love, I mean, people have great recipes. - Yeah. And I just love.. - [Teresa] They're treasures. - I just love seeing what other people do. So thank you, Elizabeth. You do good, girl. You do real good.";['postres']
DufQaBB4P5A.json;so let me tell y'all something I got a wonderful text from somebody out there that watches Quarantine cooking and this came from dome from Massachusetts and listen to this Paula I have been watching your quarantine recipes on YouTube thank you for doing this have one question a friend and I came across a recipe for water pie from the depression have you ever heard of it or made it sounds weird how water can be the base of the pie and actually make a filling let me know what you think well I tell you what dawn I had never heard a water pie have you ever heard of it no so apparently our grandmothers and great-grandmother's had a little bit more than water and make their pies with but I just thought it was so interesting so Eddie went and got on the web and he found a recipe but depression well one just says water pie but another one says depression-era water pine so we're gonna try this and dawn these ingredients yes see I mean you got the ingredients but so Thank You Don for bringing this to my attention because I love doing new things now I tell you what I'm gonna feel so weird about doing this so the recipe y'all says to pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees and set your empty pie crust on a baking sheet pour one and a half some water into the pie crust go Susie if you mess up I think it's gonna be like constable be running everywhere all right it's it's in a small bowl stir together flour and sugar you can just add it to that one right there okay there you go start together flour and sugar sprinkle evenly over the water in the crust don't stir okay so sprinkle evenly over water in the crust this looks like something you do in a kindergarten yeah and it's mixed up good so you can't feel the flour this just does not sound right y'all no eggs let me tell you about bread pudding this does not go bad could tip top with YouTube's you catch the bread pudding like the king I'm glad yes Francie wouldn't love this well I you know I just love trying new things well had you ever had a shoofly pie I have happen Pennsylvania that's what kind of nudge me up a little bit but they things like molasses oh that yeah now we're gonna get this butter to melt in there no you don't you just lay it on top but we've got to do our vanilla first so now it says drizzle for Noah and just it says two teaspoons and so I guess we do some dress on it best you can drizzle that little tiny bit of vanilla sugar water all right yeah all right I'm gonna just trying to watch out that vanilla okay so now it said that the thing that makes this pie so good is that butter and you just lay it lay the butter five pieces yes cause for five tablespoons cut into five pieces I'm telling you this is just amazing all right so it's probably gonna be tomorrow yes before it's gonna be cut about because it's a bake at 400 for 30 minutes then reduce heat to 375 and cover science of the crust if needed to prevent it from burning continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes Pam will be watery when you pull it out of the oven but will gel as it cools allow to cool completely then cover in place in the fridge until chilled before cutting so it's gotten so late in the day that we won't we won't be able to taste this tonight but tomorrow in the morning when we get up we're gonna come in here and we gonna taste this chip I can't either you want to open that oven door for me and I will very gently oh my god don't stumble Paula 30 minutes yeah okay the pair is so striking I see it done until tomorrow and will move your back right here in this kitchen and we'll have some water pipe maybe we have to eat it with a straw or spoon but that's all right if you like alright so let's see what we got and believe in not you started off at the cup and a half of water in cup and a half of water pie crust in a raw pie crust I thought great time of day and it balls I'm hung ok bubbles wanted to know when I when I had these scissors out for and I rip play and I've shown me all this before I do remember but to me it just helps you get that first piece out if I think I need yes yes I'm just gonna come in here that thing else so short short on that thumb well I've already messed it up yes if you just help hold that pint for me please you know that first piece is usually very ugly trying to get it out but if you'll cut that tenth hole and then press it down scoop it up uh-huh it just helps that first piece to come out in a pre feels like it's tough no I don't think it had a crack this has had a few cracks and I worked on smoothing it out and so did you oh look ya'll it looks like a custard time now if it will just pass the taste test alright now let me say this you know what this kind of pie I think you could add lemon juice and lemon zest or orange zest you could add some cinnamon to it you could add almond extract and make it more um so this base you can take it a long way but hopefully it's gonna be so good yeah vegetables see see that's the pinch yes just a pinch because we got to make this thing pudding so it's all about looks not changed so I say alright that little piece was jagged uh-oh you're taking a long time to try it I know I'm swallowing hard y'all so we don't have but one fork so what are you gonna do let me tell you what I probably would not sure we'll just share I'm not gonna do that to ya alright oh I'll go first yes Bon Appetit yo now I'm going to have a little cream with mine I wouldn't make that again I would make it again but put a little something in it to give it a little bit more flavor but that's delicious it's like a custard pie without come on Teresa one get you a fork it takes you during the Depression when you didn't have anything I'm gonna taste it without the whipping cream so water sugar a little bit of flour and you got that probably had floured am I so excited during the Depression they didn't have a ready-made choice Teresa ain't got nothing it's different let's put it like that in there

E4TU0GcBHa4.json;"- Hey, y'all I got the sweetest letter from a man named Ron Thompson. And he said, ""Dear Paula and team, ""I have so enjoyed watching. your videos over the past year. ""Like others, I drink my coffee with you, ""Theresa, and Eddie every morning. ""The casual format is perfect ""and I really feel like. I'm there with you guys."" Ron, thank you. 'Cause that means the world to me and Eddie and Theresa, that you feel like you're here with us. 'Cause that's our goal is to really drag you into our kitchen. So he sent me a recipe for. a chocolate chip poundcake that his mother has been. making for so many years, she can't remember. And it's funny, Ron, because I've got a chocolate chip recipe in my first cookbook. And I was thinking the other day, I thought I ought to make. that chocolate chip poundcake 'cause it's so easy and it's very good. So I pulled out my cookbook to see what the difference was. And there's several things. that you do differently that I really liked the sound of. So you may have me off of my. own recipe and onto this one. Even though it's old to. your family, it's new to me. So here it goes. And it's so easy. It's so easy. It's one box of yellow cake mix. And literally you just mix. all the ingredients together. I think this is one of those. cakes you could just stir up and it'd be fine. All right, one small package of vanilla or French instant pudding. That's gonna make it light and fluffy. One eight-ounce cup of sour cream. Now, my recipe didn't call for sour cream, but my grandmother's. poundcake that's ever so good calls for sour cream. So we know that that's gonna. be very, very good in there. Okay. Let's see what the next thing is now. Four eggs. (eggs rattling) (eggs tapping) Michael makes his own. breakfast every morning and he brought this little. trinket from the grocery store. And he wants eggs for. breakfast in the morning. And it's like a little egg poacher that you put in the microwave. Have you all seen those? He can cook the most. wonderful poached eggs in that little thing in like 45 seconds. Alright, so let's see what. the next ingredient is. 1/2 a cup of oil. And Ron said he uses canola. - [Theresa] And that is canola - [Paula] And that is canola. 1/2 a cup of water. And a six-ounces milk chocolate. chip bar, slightly chopped. Theresa did a good job chopping that. - [Theresa] I grated it. - You grated it (laughs). All right. And then one bar of. semi-sweet baker's chocolate. Well, Ron. I didn't have quite six. ounces of chocolate. So I finished it off with. white chocolate chips. And I love them. All right, so we gonna beat. this, maybe two minutes. I think that's what it. says on the cake mix box. Now where mine was a little different, mine called for a cup, I mean a package of vanilla pudding and a package of chocolate pudding. But like I said, yours has got sour cream. Mine doesn't. I really, really think that you gonna have me converted, son. You gonna have old mama converted. Now, because these are chunky, I'm gonna wait and I'm. gonna stir those in. So I won't beat them up too bad. Now we're just gonna, (beaters tapping) we're just gonna stir in the white and what chocolate chips I had. This is gonna be so good. You know what I'm gonna do? Ron, and I hope you don't mind, I'm just gonna add a. little vanilla flavoring. That's probably two teaspoons. Ooh, I can't wait to taste this. I think my version looked a. little bit more chocolatey, but I'm sure that's because of the little package. of chocolate pudding. Okay. So now I'm just gonna. spray my pan real good so we don't have any. trouble in them getting low. So I got a tiddly bit of one and a tidily bit of another. (pan spray whooshing) Oh, I can't believe this has. just made the whole cake. Whole cake pan. Okay, so here we go. This is a real thick batter, Ron. And Ron told me. I got tickled and I. thought it was so cute. In the directions, you. wanna bake this on 350 in a preheated oven, y'all, and for 55 to 60 minutes. And he said very rarely. does it take 60 minutes for it to cook. He said sometimes. Let's see. Sometimes it's done in 53 minutes. So, I mean, Ron's on that time with me. He's watching that clock. So you know what, Ron? I'm gonna set mine for 50 minutes and I'll start looking at it then and checking it out. 'Cause he said, be sure. not to over bake this. So I sure don't wanna over bake it. Down to the last drop. So... The kitchen crew here will see y'all back in 55 minutes to show y'all Ron's mama's chocolate chip cake. Guess what? Guess what? It was ready in 50 minutes. Perfectly beautiful. And I've got to let it. cool for a few minutes, but it looks so delicious. So here we go, Ron. Wish us luck. Hope it didn't stick. Come on. Come on man. Woo hoo! All right! One little stick. There you go. Never know it stuck. Mm, mm, mm. It is so hot, y'all. Ron, that is ever more, one beautiful cake. Mm! You know, it's probably too hot to eat, but I'm gonna taste it. I'm gonna taste it anyway. And I'm just gonna put. it on my best china. Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh. Like I said, I cooked it for. Wanna turn it towards the. camera so y'all can see. I mean, it is hot hot. Mm. Oh! Look at that. Would y'all look at that! Getting out three forks. And here she comes.. (Theresa laughs) She was sitting down over there, but that's gotten her up. Look at that beautiful cake.. - I thought we were gonna wait but.. - Well, we trying. - I'm glad you didn't.. - We're trying to wait. - [Theresa] We're not, it's not working. - But look at that.. - Especially with sweets. - [Paula] You did so good during Lent. - [Theresa] I know! How did I do that? - [Paula] I don't know. I don't know how you did it.. - I don't either. I'm glad that it's over. Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream. - [Paula] Uh-huh, you know what? I just realized there's no nuts in this. - [Theresa] There's not. Wow it's moist! - Mm! Eddie? You gonna fork you a piece? - [Eddie] I'll get a piece. - This is so good. - [Theresa] See, he's become good. He's no fun. - Here. Look, Theresa's reaching for the plate. - [Theresa] Well, how can you not? Yum! - Thank you so much for sharing. Jesus said to share. Thank you so much, darling.";['postres']

mamas for his birthday every year and don't blink cause this finger licking frosting and filling is seven minutes from start to finish and last but not least a backyard carnival complete with my famous cake-filled frosted ice cream cones so y'all put on your party shoes and leave you dying at the door cause today we're celebrating it's a very special day we're celebrating someone's birthday and i want everything to be perfect i heard about this girl named lisa that supposedly makes spectacular cakes and i'm gonna go see her and just see if she will share with us a few of her trade secrets and i really would like for you all to come along with me so let's go let's get going [Music] hey hi there how are you i'm looking for lisa i am i'm paula dean it's very nice to meet you jerry nice to meet you paul i'm glad you found us i'm i'm just popping in unexpectedly on you we love unexpected visitors i'm having a birthday party okay at my house and i just wanted to come by and see if you could give me a few tips on cake making i would love to we'll do a nice little cake for you for today what are you making here this is a italian meringue buttercream icing that i'm going to apply to the base of this cake and i'll show you how easy this is done this is a little cake turntable that i'm using and i'm spreading the icing as i'm turning the cake on the turntable and it's kind of a nifty little thing to use to make sure i get a nice smooth outer coating on the cake itself so it looks a little bit rough now you can see that but i'm going to show you a secret that's what i want to know this is very very hot water and i'm going to run my spatula under that hot water and being that we've got our icing that's made with butter if you take a look here it's going to melt the icing just enough ever so slightly as i run the spatula around to make it perfectly perfectly smooth i wondered how y'all got it now you know my secret now that looks much better than when we first started lisa then went on to show me a few of our other decorating secrets like these adorable little sugar doe dots and stripes that really spruce up any cake but you know hands down my favorite was lisa's beautiful edible roses one of the most popular types of flowers is an icing flower which is made with icing of course buttercream icing you can use royal icing as well and it's made with the pastry bag and this is called a rose tip and you can do different types of flowers with this rose tip most importantly of course is a rose and you make a little base with your icing and then you twirl it around and then you put on of course consecutive petals let's just make like a nice little rosebud and then we have this other nifty little tool that removes it from the cake and you can adhere it right to the edge of the cake lisa also showed me how to put on a fancy icing border that's not only beautiful but it also helps to hide the cracks and finally lisa gave me some of these real pretty little flower sprinkles to use at home but you know i really couldn't get over the beauty of lisa's cakes you're truly an artist thank you i'm so glad you came today it's just amazing we'll put it right in a box for you lisa i i can't thank you enough you've just made a special day even more special will you enjoy it thanks so much you're very welcome enjoy the rest of your day oh you too bye-bye now bye-bye [Music] wasn't that just amazing what we found at sweet lisa's i couldn't believe it i've got the cake here and i'm going to just tuck it away in the refrigerator and we'll open this up a little bit later i'm going to show you my son jamie's favorite birthday cake every time he has a birthday he says mama please make me my coconut cake and this is so easy it's a basic one two three four cake the reason it's called a one two three four cake is because it calls for one cup of butter two cups of sugar three cups of flour and four eggs so there's your one two three four so we're gonna start by creaming one cup of butter we're gonna add two cups of sugar [Music] and we're gonna add four eggs to this but we're gonna add them one at the time one more and the other and there goes the last one all right now we're going to start by adding our self-rising flour and our coconut milk so here we go and last i'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla and you're ready to load your batter into your cake pans now i like to use a little container with a handle on it like this and i'll start with one cup one cup for your next one and so on and so on until you've got them all filled and i'm going to take the spatula and just work the batter out to the edges i'm going to pick them up and drop them and it's going to bring the air from the cake to the surface and you can see the air bubbles coming up and it'll just give us a little bit more level cake these are ready to go in the 350 degree oven all right those are safely in the oven i'm going to cook them for about 25 minutes but in the other oven i have some that should be about ready and they are you can see that they've started pulling away from the pan which lets me know that they're ready they look just delicious when we come back i'm gonna show you how to turn those cake layers into a mouth-watering coconut cake [Music] we're back and i've just cut a few strips of wax paper right here and in a few minutes i'm going to show you what i'm going to do with them but in the meantime i'm going to show you how to make the most delectable filling for this cake we're going to start with sugar sour cream coconut and a little milk all right we're ready to start stacking now so we're just gonna flip that out like that thank goodness it came out nice and we're gonna take our wax paper now and just slip it a little under the edge of our cake and this will help keep our plate clean now we're going to take that cake layer and i like using a wooden spoon i like about this size i like for my holes to be really big so it can seep down in there you can use a a fork or a toothpick but i found the bigger the hole the better the cake then we're going to take our filling and just spoon it look at it you can see it running down into those holes moistening that layer from top to bottom there we go and on this layer we're going to start with our toothpicks so you'll have to alert your guests to be on the lookout for toothpicks because you don't want your cake to look like the leaning tower we're gonna do the same thing all over again and another layer of filling all right we're ready for the final layer now now the secret to this cake is letting that cake marinate in the refrigerator for three days and hope nobody's gonna touch it and you know i was prepared so i have one right here that's been in there just drinking up that filling you can see by this it's not a beauty but we're going to fix that because we're fixing to make a divinity icing that we're going to cover this cake in and you won't believe the transformation it's going to be like putting on our makeup and this is so simple to make we're going to start with egg whites sugar pinch of salt about a fourth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar plain old water so we're gonna beat this for one minute so that's been about a minute and at this point we're going to use the double boiler method and we're going to sit this bowl on top of rapidly boiling water and i'm gonna set my timer for seven minutes and we're gonna beat this okay our seven minutes is up i heard our timer go off and now i'm just gonna add a little bit of vanilla to it and i'm just gonna gently stir that in with a spatula and we're going to start by putting some up on the edge and then we're going to bring it slowly bring it down we're going to make sure that frosting goes all the way to the bottom and covers up every crumb of our cake kinda looks like marshmallow heaven all right now we're just going to bring that icing on up to the top there's only one thing left to do and that's to put the coconut on the top kind of just press it in against your cake so when you get through you're gonna have a little frosting probably to lick off looks like a big snowball doesn't it this cake is ready so now we're just ever so gently gonna slip our wax paper out from underneath that layer and we have a clean plate what a great trick that is you know it's just great having two of everything that means i can taste this one here we go i'm in heaven so gummy the adults really love this cake and i can't have a party without making the kids something extra special too so we're fixing to make ice cream cone cakes so i'm gonna need y'all's help see you in a minute [Music] okay we're ready to get those ice cream cone cakes ready for the kids and you know i'm really not going to a whole bunch of trouble because they're going to be eating them so fast and running and laughing and playing they're not gonna know that i didn't make them from scratch so all we're gonna do is start with our favorite cake mix three eggs [Music] now you can jazz these cake mixes up a little bit usually when i use a cake mix i'll add four eggs to just give it a little bit more fluff but for these ice cream cake cones it's gonna be just perfect this way but i am substituting the water for milk now there goes our oil and i do like to add about a teaspoon of vanilla okay i think it's been about four minutes now that should be ready so all we're gonna do at this point is fill up our little cones i'm going to fill those not quite full about two-thirds to three-quarters of the way full and these are ready to go in the oven and we'll start checking them about 10 minutes oh and i've got another batch right over here that should be about ready oh and those look good the batter kind of came out on some of them that's great and i've got some sitting right over here that's already cool they're cool enough for us to go ahead and frost and i'm gonna use a very quick icing today actually i've gone to a canned icing so i've got my pastry bag loaded with chocolate icing and i'm using a star tip so we're just going to pick these up and just start rolling our icing on and then when we get around here we're going to move on up top cone around just like this until we get a nice little curly top on it some kids like chocolate and some kids like vanilla so we're going to do some of each we're gonna try to please the whole gang okay i've got two of these frosted and i'm gonna put some of these wonderful little sugared flowers that lisa gave me and i'm going to want to put them on there before the frosting hardens it won't take me any time to decorate these and when i get through i'm gonna come back and share a few more baking tips with you and then we gonna have a party [Music] [Music] ice cream you scream we all scream for ice cream and i don't know of a soul that doesn't love those ice cream cone cakes and when you go to dip it up another great topping is toasted coconut it's so delicious and when you're ready to tote those cones out to the children at the party if you have an old ornament box from christmas it works great to tote your cones in i think i finally got everything ready for the birthday party this magnificent cake that lisa gave me is out of this world and jamie's favorite coconut cake and these adorable little ice cream cones for the kids in fact speaking of kids i hear them now so i'm gonna have to run [Music] hey kids kids y'all ready who's ready for ice cream chum cakes come on all right now

eduKL9IAC4c.json;- Hey, y'all it's Jamie. Dane here today with Paula. Not really, we're in mom's kitchen though, and it is fall, ♪ it is fall, it is fall, the. leaves are falling everywhere. ♪ Remember that? Talking about that? It's a yo Gabba Gabba. For those of you, you do not have kids or cable television. Yo Gabba Gabba says it. is fall and it is fall. So we're having fall. recipes for this month. Today, we're doing a. souffle pumpkin pancake. My kids love pancakes. It's. a real hassle to my pancakes. When Jack was born, somebody gave me a round. pancake pan with animals in it. You pour the batter, you flip them and there's. animals on the pancakes. That is the best, easiest. way for me to make pancakes, flipping them and doing them all in a skillet. is a real challenge. So today this is a souffle pancakes, which are going to see is. going to be their list. So we're going to start with. two tablespoons of butter in this pan that we have to melt. - If we turned on the stove cause, you know, we have such good. - [Jamie] We have our,. our, our production people, aren't always that's the wrong huh. (ignites stove) This won't take one second. So, if you don't like doing. pancakes at the house, If you don't like the. mess or any of that stuff, this is going to be a good recipe for you. You Melt this couple of. tablespoons of butter. This is two tablespoons. of butter into this. I'm going to add one. tablespoon of brown sugar. Then we also have a quarter cup of pecans. If you don't have, if you're not fortunate. enough to live in the south, where there are pecan trees everywhere. I use a lot of fresh. pecans and lots of times I'll just go out and pick them up myself. They sell them at the grocery store. And if you get some home. and you need only a quarter, a cup for a recipe, take your pecans and put. them into the freezer, and then you always have. free fresh pea cans, no matter what, the time of the year. And we're gonna, we're just going to do this mixture down in the skillet, and then we're going to save. it because this is actually the pan that we're going to be. cooking our pancakes in. So, this butter is down far enough for me. We're going to add our brown sugar. I'm going to work this into. the hot butter just until it starts to melt. So, you know, any recipe that starts with. butter and brown sugar is going to be popular recipe around here, is basically Cameron and we love us. You can see how the sugar. has started to melt, and I don't want to cook. it all the way down, before i have my pecans in here. We're going to turn these, maybe give this a couple. of minutes to cook. These are raw pecans, so we want them to soften. up just a little bit. Okay y'all, I've cooked these pecans. for about two minutes and our butter and brown sugar. I'm just going to put it. in a separate little bowl. - I can eat just that. - Me too, buddy, for. that over some ice cream. Ooh, Okay, I'm going. to stay the skillet up because we'll be working with that skillet a little bit later. Our next step is our dry ingredients. And I'm going to read off the. paper because Teresa wants me to tell you measurements all the time. So what we're going to do is mix together two thirds of a cup of flour. We have one teaspoon of pumpkin POSS bias, a third of a cup of sugar. What we like to call it? A pinch of salt, its a. quarter of a teaspoon of salt, convenient, the turnaround at mom's house, and just be able to grab. so many wooden items disturbed with that. We're going to mix all this up together, back to the stove. Okay Y'all, I didn't even. have to turn this panel. This melted three more. tablespoons of butter for me. So we've got this. I'm going. to go into a large bowl. We're going to whisk in three egg yolks, two thirds of a cup of buttermilk. - Jamie. I think it was. actually four egg yolks. One just happened to be, - [Jamie] that was um four, - Um, hmm. - [Jamie] Oh, it sure is. So that's four egg yolks. and we have two thirds, a cup of buttermilk. We have one and a half. teaspoons of vanilla extract, and this is one teaspoon. So we'll go one and than a whisk more, scientific measurements right here, and then into this, we're also going to whisk in. our flour mixture that we made from before that, the. last ingredient here, I'll go ahead and get all the. measurements out of the way. This is one cup of pumpkin pure, right? So the flour that we did earlier, I'm going to whisk it. into our wet ingredients. You don't ever want to dump. all your dry stuff and it just makes it too hard to. get it all incorporated. So we're repeating this process where? we gradually add dry to wet. (stirring mixture) This recipe is a little bit. more detailed than what y'all see from me, but I promise. you it's going to be worth. It's a simple fall. pancake that you can fix, and you know, the hardest thing is trying. to make sure that the last person eating a pancake, can eat somewhat close. to the first person. Even the pancake is hard to. make a bunch of pancakes and keep up, keep them all. hot and fresh and ready. (stirring mixture) Awesome, (clanks whisk) and now we're going to. add our pumpkin puree, Which it really smells. like a fresh pumpkin, - Look, that pretty color. - [Jamie] So beautiful. This is going to be delicious. And they're called the off. chance that my momma sees this and I'll make sure every. bit of that egg outta there. Momma taught us that the profits. are in the corner's boys. (stirring mixture) We should save each out behind you. And there's barely enough. for a rabbit to eat, by the time I get down with it. Okay? All this is mixed together. Get back to our big table. - Okay. I'll take it in the egg white, four egg whites, four yolks that I use (Hand mixture swooshing) Now they're in a little bowl. And I am gonna whisk these until soft peek form. so Its kinda like a marian. Already getting started. because this feels like watching paint job. Um, just a few more seconds,. and one it feels firmed up, We will be ready and. going for the next step - All right. Y'all that. song pinky enough for me. And you gotta be careful because. I learned this the hard way in the restaurant. One day, you can over whip something. and break it right back down. So you don't want to beat this too much. And then another thing which. is related to you don't want to work it too much. We're going to fold the. egg whites into here. We're going to incorporate these. egg whites into our pumpkin mixture, taking care to fold it in. Don't want to overwork this, but we have to get an incorporated gently just going to work all this. I wish I could smell this smell so good. Now these egg whites are going. to just make our pancakes so light and fluffy. And that's all I'm going to. be very careful with that instead of the little. skillet that we started with, we're going to use it. And we're going to spoon this. mixture down into our scale at which is properly graced. because we have melted five tablespoons of butter down in. here over the last little bit. (pouring from bowl) (clanks spatula) If you're making this for yourself, you can just have one pancake, but when it comes out of the oven, you're going to slice it like corn bread. Alright. (clanks spatula) In our last step to this, before we cook it is we're. going to get our pecans and make sure our Pecans and brown sugar. Look, it's starting to harden. up on me for making candy. I really don't want to splash and take I must have grate that up. Let me see what I got. I got stuff all over me. Okay, i had to break that up. and harden up a little bit. I'm going to sprinkle this around. Good gracious, Does this look good? - And that melts on top. is going to be fabulous. - [Jamie] Um, hmm. (clanks spatula) Super good. So, this is going into the oven. Now, let me check and make sure, because I'll just tell you, 350 for 25 minutes for everything. If it goes into the oven at 350 degrees, and it's going to cook for. 20 to 30 minutes until it's golden brown will take one second. Kind of arrange my pecans here. on top so we could see them. That's it. The Oven's at 350 and we're. going to cook this for, let's check on it in 20. minutes, and we'll see, and lucky here, y'all Sue. flayed, pumpkin pancake. - Oh my gosh. That looks so good. - [Jamie] And it smells, Oh my gosh, and so we're going to finish it. We're just going to put a little. confectioner sugar on here, make it look pretty sweet,. get up just to touch. And I mean, I just pulled. this out of the oven, but I cannot wait to taste it. So if I were at my house serving. this mama was going to be so proud when I started. shaking that harder than I did, but I wanted y'all to see it. I would probably let this, I'm not going to let it cool. down because everybody wants a warm pancake, but I probably would let it sit here for three or four minutes. Cause it just come out of the oven, and if you want to get a nice clean cut, but it's just me and y'all so, let's see what we got this way. So if you want to cut it, like a pie. You got four folks or if you got eight, I always. like to cut it in half. And that way you get. pretty true measurements. Everybody gets about the same. I know mom has a tool for this but she would tell you that. I am hard headed and I do not want to wait and go find that tool. So I'm always willing for the. first piece to come out ugly, - look at how good that looks. - [Jamie] So light and. fluffy and delicious. Um, my mouth is watering. Let me get a fork. Let me tell you, I just licked my finger and. the caramel stuff on the top is to die. Um, um, Um, That is good. Just the way it is. But if it's a pancake, I want. a little bit of sharp on here. Just a little bit. Y'all I'm telling you this. recipe is going to be a huge hit and your next brunch or your breakfast, for yourself, for your family. It's really easy to do. and so light and fluffy. Um, um, Woo, woooh Going to be hot too.. When it comes to oven. Delicious. Thanks for tuning in today Y'all um, see you around the kitchen.;['postres']
EJ7IggVG4Go.json;- What does everybody think. about at Valentine's Day? There are people out there. that you can go on the web. And you can order. chocolate-covered strawberries, all different kinds, real. fancy ones, beautiful ones. But you know what, they. may not be as beautiful as those that we can order. that are done by artists. But it's fun, it's fun to do them at home. You can get your kids. in there to help you. Or if you have cooked. dinner for your husband or your wife, whatever the case, and you clear the plates for dinner, this would be so much fun to make your chocolate covered. strawberries together. I'm gonna put these in the microwave. And I'm gonna heat them. at 30-second intervals. Because this is, we're. melting just pure chocolate. There's gonna be no. other liquid added to it, so this is where you have. to pay very close attention. Milk chocolate can not. tolerate more than 85 degrees. Milk chocolate can not tolerate anything more than 87 or 88 degrees. And dark chocolate can tolerate. heat up to just 90 degrees. So, once you start overheating them, there's a good chance. they're gonna mess up on you. And you don't want ever add. a little milk to thin it out. Because it seizes up on you. And you could use it for concrete mix. So, I'm gonna put these chocolate wafers in the microwave for 30 seconds, and I'm gonna see what we've got. Now, before you dip your strawberries this is very, very, very important, that if you can buy the strawberries with a beautiful long stems on it. They can be hard to find. But if you can find those,. those help out a lot. To make up for being stemless,. Eddie has stuck toothpicks in all of them, so I'd have. something to hold onto to dip. But you'll want to wash. your strawberries really, really well, leaving. the green cap on them. Because that just adds color and interest. You'll want to dry them. Dry them very, very well. And then put them in your refrigerator. I would say keep them in the fridge, I mean, you could overnight wouldn't hurt. But, certainly, several hours for them to completely dry out. Because like I said a while ago, you mix any kind of liquid. with your melting chocolate, and it's gonna seize up on ya. - [Theresa] Seize! - Seize up on you! (laughs) Thank you, Theresa. - [Theresa] I was hoping. Eddie was gonna help you. - No, Eddie's quiet as a mouse. He's just gonna let me make a fool out of myself, aren't you? (laughs) Oh, I know it, and hopefully he gets some good blooper materials. (laughs) All right, so I'm gonna do that. So, those are the. important, important tips that you must follow in order to have a successful chocolate covered strawberry. All right, now our strawberries have been washed and. dried, like, overnight. And I think we were going. through the kitchen. And I've got these beautiful. white, the big grains of sugar that looked. like chipped up diamonds. And I shook a little of. this pink diamond dust. So, it colored it a little bit. I'm gonna try it like this. And if it needs it more I'll. pop it back in the microwave. All right, so here we go. How deep do we want to go? I think I'd want a little chocolate, I mean, a little strawberry showing. I think the ones that they. make like tuxedo shirts, you've seen those, haven't you? - [Eddy] Yeah, yeah. - All right, but this is. pretty right here to me. Just looks like diamonds,. diamonds in the sky. And you just want to. make sure that you put it on wax paper or parchment paper. And it will let you know. which side it wants to sit on. What do you think, Eddy? - Looks good!. - I think so, too. Ooh, I just wish I had a stem. Because these toothpicks. feel a little unstable. You see how they're spinning? See how they fall off?. - Yeah. - That's all right. That's all right. That's all right. (laughs) Keep telling yourself. Paula, it's all right. Okay, all right. I think I'm gonna, (laughs) I can't take the cap off with one hand. I think I'm gonna shake some red on this one and see what that looks like. I don't think a toothpaste. is gonna do the job, Eddy. I think we're gonna have. to maybe use something with a sharper point, like a fondue. And you can see that chocolate. gets sticky pretty quick, I mean, hard pretty quick. So, there we go. All right, we're gonna roll this one in sweet little pink hearts. And you have to be very,. very quick with your dipping. Because this gets hard so quick, then your glitters won't stick to it. But if you're an artist,. my gracious, you could go to town on this and have so much fun. Look at that, that's so pretty! Isn't that pretty? I just love the sugar that. looks like chopped up diamonds. - [Eddy] Yeah, it's like that. sugared fruit at Christmas. - Yes, yes, yes! Ooh, I'm definitely. gonna take some of these to the babies because they will love it. And you know what? The mother, the mothers. will be pretty happy too. Because, remember, it's. good for 'em, it's fruits. I ran the chocolate for another. 15 seconds in the microwave. So now it's working perfectly,. perfectly beautiful. Perfect! Look at that one. That's got the red and the. white diamonds, diamond dust. Well, I think this is so much fun. And I think it could really. be a fun family project. I had fun with my family,. my extended family. (laughs) Now, I'm gonna get the little sucker back. And I'm gonna suck up all them little white circles. of sugar off the floor. Eddy I feel struck!

EQBAiC0oBwk.json;- Hey friends. I hope y'all are doing. really, really well today. Myself, I've been kind of. thinking about Mother's Day. You know, the time just rolls like you wouldn't believe doesn't it, Teresa?. - It does. - Where does it go? Did it go this fast when we were young? - [Teresa] No. - I don't think so. I don't remember.. - Especially when we were in school. - Oh, in school, the days were so long. (laughs) But anyway, having said that, I kind of am thinking. about Mother's Day now. So I thought, well, I. will share some recipes with the family members of the mother and maybe they can make. your mother's day meal. - [Teresa] Hint hint. - Yeah. So if you like this recipe,. share it with whomever you're going to designate. to be your dessert maker. And I think you'll like this one. We're going back with. our good old standby, our gooey butter cakes. But we are gonna dress this. one up just a little bit. If you like lavender, if you like that little hint of lavender, you will love this recipe. So we're gonna start with. the one box of cake mix. Whoa, get out of there. Any kind of cake mix, it. doesn't matter who it's by. But for this one we are. using a yellow cake mix because we want to keep the. flavor of our cake simple, so our lavender will be able to stand out. All right, so we're gonna put in one egg and we're putting in how. much lavender is this? - [Teresa] Two teaspoons. - Two teaspoons. And Teresa told me, and. it smells so good, y'all. And I asked Theresa, I said, now where did you find that. pulverized lavender? And she said, well, I wound. up having to order it off - Amazon.. - Amazon, yeah. So I wish you could smell it. Smell, Eddie, you like. lavender, don't you? - [Eddie] Yes, you know, - my favorite is. - From back in the day. - [Eddie] Back in the. day shortbread cookies, with the lavender. - [Teresa] I'm was. gonna try to make those. - Well, I think they would be delicious but I remember Eddie saying we have a friend here that. has Back in the Day Bakery. And I remember Eddie making the comment, oh, I love her lavender cookies. - [Teresa] You know, she. makes them also into like a sandwiched cookie with. buttercream in the middle. Oh my Lord.. - Oh, like. - [Teresa] Like a sandwich cookie with. - Well now I can't think. of the word, like a. - [Eddie] Like a Whoopie pie. - A Whoopie pie, thank you, Eddie. It's a good thing he knows me so well, he can finish my sentences for me. (laughs) - [Teresa] It is so good. - All right, you know what? I'm not gonna do that. lavender with the beater. Because I want to just. stir in our lavender. I don't wanna lose a bit of that lavender, you know in my beaters,. because it will get caught and you'll lose some, so. I'm just gonna stir that in. What's wrong? Oh, somebody cut it off. Somebody had cut it off at the main switch. That york is so pretty and orange. Oh, y'all I have missed my chickens. But Eddie and I are making plans we gonna get us a little. old lean tooth Chicken coup and we gonna get our chickens back, which we're so excited over. Okay. And you remember this. is a real stiff batter because this is a crust. to our gooey butter cake. Okay, come on, sling off,. but don't sling on me. Am I slinging on you, Eddie? - Nope.. (laughs) - I don't think it's gonna sling off. So I'll just have to encourage it. You know, I still love just. the plain gooey butter cakes. - [Teresa] This might be my new favorite, 'cause I love lavender, I'm like Eddie. - Well, y'all gonna have plenty of lavender gooey. butter cakes in just a minute. In goes our lavender. And I'm just gonna work it in. And then we gonna press this in to the bottom of the. 13 by nine by two pan. And you know, if you want thicker then you could use a nine by nine I don't know if they. make a 10 by 10 or not, but that's if you just want them thicker.. - Nowadays they make everything. - And I'll tell you what. else works good for 'em, is a spring form pan, y'all. Yeah. And it makes 'em so easy to get out and of course the presentation. is very, very pretty. All right, so this is lightly greased. It doesn't take a bunch, y'all because our crust has a stick. of butter in it already. So we just gonna press this. out where it's completely even. Looks like we got grass. in there, doesn't it? (laughs) Like we got grass shavings. Well maybe trying to scoot it up the sides just a little bit. Just a whee little bit. - I'm gonna go ahead and.. - Preheat that oven. - [Teresa] That's right. So you do put it up. the sides a little bit. - Yeah I said I'm yeah, yeah. I'm gonna put it up just a little bit, so it'll hold that cream. I don't always do that, Teresa, 'cause usually I'm in a hurry. - [Teresa] But I like what you mean in order to hold the filling.. - Yeah. Kind of holds the filling. - [Teresa] Well, back in the day you had to make so many at one time you wouldn't have.. - Oh gosh, I threw that stuff in there. (laughs) Oh I threw it in there. - [Teresa] I lived off of them when we were in the restaurant. What a great thing to live off of. - That and a fried chicken leg. A handle sandwich. Oh great time, (indistinct). that was so good. That's all we had time to eat. We didn't, even though at three. o'clock the restaurant, I had to hold the restaurant and sit down and have lunch together. after we had served. lunch to all our guests. And you could always tell a new person, 'cause honey they couldn't. get enough of that food. I mean they would sit down. and eat and eat and eat. And then you could tell if. they've been there a while. I think I'm gonna grab. me a sandwich somewhere. (laughs) I'll go to McDonald's. Okay, so I've got that patted. out really, really nice. So in our next bowl and you don't even have. to clean your beaters because it's all going in the same pot. - [Teresa] Got you a bigger bowl. I don't know if you need it.. - Oh no, this is fine. I could stand some new eyes. (laughs) There, okie dokey. So I'm gonna start with a eight. ounce bar of cream cheese. And I'm gonna just beat it a little bit, just get it a little softer. (beater whirs) It's good, Teresa. - [Teresa] Paula, one. of the questions said. - Yeah. - [Teresa] One of the. questions we get a lot is how do you know they're done because you still want 'em to be gooey? - You know, that is the, that is where people have a. great opportunity to overdo it. Because when you shake that pan, it should still be a. little loose in the center because after it cools, you know, it's gonna harden back up, but just don't overcook it. Start watching it close,. that last five minutes and you should be good. All right so now I'm gonna add two eggs. The crust just takes one egg. and the filling takes two. Because that helps set the gooey filling. (beater whirs) Okay. Putting that egg in first. will keep me from eating it, 'because I don't like the. thought of eating raw eggs. So that works out good. (laughs) - [Teresa] Look how. pretty those yolks are, I mean the color is just beautiful. - Beautiful, bright orange. Yeah, I can't hardly wait. to get our chickens back. I can't hardly wait. All right, we've got our two eggs with a eight ounce. package of cream cheese. Now I'm gonna add one. pound of powdered sugar. Okay? And then we're gonna add our butter and we're gonna add our lemon juice because remember this is a lemon lavender. So we've got to bring in. that lemon flavor to it. You know, the grocery stores. makes a lemon cake mix, but I have tried it and to me it tastes very, very artificial. So I don't know, maybe they've. changed their recipe for it but I just found that it was. too artificially tasting. So if you want lemon, I. would suggest doing it just like I'm gonna do. by adding the lemon juice and the zest. Look at that, how pretty that is. Beautiful. All right. Now I'm gonna add the juice of two lemons. Just beat that in. So these are gonna be nice and tart. That makes me wanna make. a lemon meringue pie. You remember that lemon. meringue pie, Eddie that I'll make once in a while with that Swiss meringue?. - Yes, yes. - Lord have mercy. That thing will make you. talk back to your mama. You'll want to make sure. that you go around your bowl, scraping everything back down in here. So it'll all get mixed up real good. And I'm gonna stir in our lemon zest because like I was talking about earlier, the zest will get caught. up in your beaters and you'll lose some of it and. I don't like losing my zest. All right, now I'm gonna add. our stick of melted butter. All right, now I'm gonna add my vanilla. You know what? I'm gonna have to shut this thing off. The sugar in the vanilla, you know, kind of makes those tops kind of sticky. Teaspoon full. We're almost there, kids. (beaters whir loudly) That looks just like lemon pie. All right. And last, this is the zest. from two large lemons. Watch it (indistinct) go in our mix. That's what happened. that day I dropped that little glass ramekin. in the cake at Oprah's. It's slick. (laughs) Okie dokey. And I do love the zest in there. Okay, so that is it. Now we're just gonna pour. this on top of our crust. And I'll make it come down a little bit with that crust. Go, Teresa, you can have everything I got. - [Teresa] I hate that. but I like to keep it (indistinct).. - No. - [Teresa] So people can. to see what you're doing. - That's exactly right. No, you are perfect. Theresa was just telling me. we've been together 19 years and I still love her. (laughs) - Ooh, that's a job too. (laughs) - I ain't heard her say well, I loved you back.. - Of course, I love you. Oh my gosh.. (laughs) - I didn't hear her say that, did y'all? (laughs). - Of course I do, oh my Lord. It's like family.. - I know, it truly is. All right. This is a thinner batter. because of the lemon juice. You know we don't usually. put any liquid in it besides the butter. - [Teresa] Is that gonna affect anything? - No. Might affect me eating more of it. (laughs) Thinking it's too thin. Look at that, that's just beautiful. - The oven's ready.. - And we're gonna get every bite of it out. All right so Teresa,. - Yes, ma'am. - this may be ready in. 40 minutes, maybe 45. - [Teresa] Okay, well. we're gonna put it at 35 and start looking. - Yeah. And maybe we can shoot inside the oven when I think it's ready. and I can jostle it and kind of show people, you. know what it should look like. - Absolutely.. - Because that is the biggest mistake. - [Teresa] And we get that question all the time.. - Is over cook it. And with it being called. gooey butter cake, you know people tend to think, well a. cake is not supposed to jiggle, but this really should be called. - Gooey.. - Gooey butter cake squares. Rather than cake.. - Well it's heavy, so I'm gonna get it for you. (laughs) Okay. So we'll come looking at. you in like 40 minutes, 35 or 40 minutes. We're getting closer, y'all but because of the extra liquid in it it's a little thinner, you can see that, that's still, I'm gonna run. that for about 10 more minutes and then we'll take another peak at it. But we're sure gonna. try not to overcook it. You twisting your butt, not the pan. - [Teresa] I know, but. you're supposed to talk. (laughs) There it is.. - You're shaking your little hiney. Yeah, that's what you doing. See that?. - Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. - [Paula] Hold your arms straight, and I'll do the jiggling. for you, how about that? - [Teresa] There we go. - So that's what it. should look like, y'all And when it cools it'll. stay together, I promise. Now how long did we wind up cooking that? - This was actually for 45 minutes. - It was. Because, here I'll get. the oven door for you. - Thank you. - Because we put it back on, what'd you start it at, Teresa? - I started it at 35.. - 35, - And then we checked it.. - then we added 10 more minutes, so 45 minutes. - Which is what the recipe says. - Yes. Our lavender lemon gooey. butter cakes are ready and 45 minutes was the. magic number for this one. Now that's without knowing. how your oven runs, that would be up to you. But 45 minutes was perfect in mine. And you saw the little jiggle the little wiggle jiggle it did? And the more this cools,. the easier it's gonna slice. Oh my gosh, Eddie. And it's so rich that. you don't need, you know, a huge piece. - [Eddie] I know that piece that we've got down in Panama City, I think I ate off that for like two days. - You did.. - Just a little at a time. - I pinched a little bit off, but by time I got to. it, it's a little old. All right so do y'all. see what that looks like? See how it's gooey looking? It's a perfect goo. And I just happen to have a little bit of fresh whipped cream. So look at that. Look at that, Teresa. Poor baby, now, when you gonna. be able to eat sweets again? - [Teresa] 12:01 Sunday morning. - Are you stay up Saturday night 'til 12:01?. - Probably not, but I may. - Well, I wish you could. take a bite of this with me. - [Teresa] I might have to make my own. - Well, you know what? This will still be good. 'til Sunday night, so. - Sunday morning.. - Sunday morning. I'm going need that, Teresa. I'm gonna need that,. that's why I left it out. 'Cause I'm doing a cooking. show, do you know it? - I didn't know that.. (laughs) Can you taste the lavender? - I was gonna say the. lavender is very faint. I really am more ready for. Eddie to taste it rather than me because he is such a big fan of lavender. - [Teresa] Why don't. you hand me that thing. - Okay.. - And you go right on over and taste it. - Yeah, let me.. - Too bad. - [Paula] Let me get him a fork. - [Teresa] Come on Eddie. - 'Cuz you can taste the lemon. - I think. - What?. - The. - You can't eat some of these? - Oh yeah, I can eat some of that. - [Teresa] The whipped cream. might also be taking a little. - I got you a clean fork. - I think I could eat just the base. It looked like it was. gonna be a cookie and some. - Here. Let me cut it for you. - Yeah. The lemon really takes over.. - Micheal and I love this. Yeah, it kind of does, doesn't it? - [Teresa] So would you add. more lavender or cut out? - No I would say.. - Lemon? - Omit.. - Yeah, yeah. Or maybe do just.. - One lemon. - Or just the maybe grate some lemon rind. - [Teresa] So just the zest,. we did put zest in there. So it has zest and juice.. - Yeah, it's got the gest. - Gest.. - Look, I sound like Aunt Peggy.. - The gest. - She said you've got the. gest of it right, Paula? Or no, no. I was cooking one day and she said do you want me to gest that? God love her. She's a hoot and a half. - [Teresa] So I'm gonna adjust. the recipe just as an FYI. And put just the zest in there. and not the lemon, agreement? - Yeah. Or if you really want. lavender, just do the lavender. - Just do lavender, eat up, Eddie. - Actually, you know what?. - What? - I could taste it now. It's an after taste, yeah.. - Oh, okay. (laughs) - Took a second. - His tongue. Yeah, I'm tasting it,. I'm really tasting it. - Yeah.. - So. - Yeah, so it's a two for one. You get the lemon first and then the rind. - I would probably recommend that y'all go right by the recipe the first time. And then you decide and then do it the way your. tongue wants you to do it the second time. Eat up, Eddie, 'cause I don't. want to have to do this. I've sacrificed enough, man.. - I'm gonna take it. (laughs) - It's a wonder my eyes are not brown. (laughs) Y'all know I'm talking about?;['postres']
ErXdfocIM8c.json;- Y'all, I wouldn't drink buttermilk if you gave me a hundred dollar bill, but I will drink it in ranch dressing (giggling) and buttermilk pie. That's the recipe I'm. gonna share with you today. And the first thing we wanna do is, we're gonna use a refrigerated pie crust because they're so good, and I don't know if y'all have ever seen the Paula Deen cutting. board like this one, but this this is like my favorite. My favorite. Excuse me, I can't think and. chew gum at the same time. This is my favorite,. favorite board that I have. Now what'd I do with my- - [Eddie] It's over there. - Rolling pin. - [Eddie] Over on the counter. - [Teresa] It's right here. - Thank you. - [Teresa] You're welcome. - All right. So on my board you can see that this is, makes an eight. inch pie just like this. And then the line for a nine. inch pie is right there. And our recipe tells us to. roll it to a 10 inch pie. So we'll have enough to. turn under and crimp it. So here we go. We're gonna get that out to. that, that biggest circle. All right y'all, I've got. my crust to a 10 inch, 10 inch round circle. Now I'm gonna put this in my pie plate. And see, this is why I asked for you to roll it out because that's gonna leave us enough dough to turn this over and make a nice big crust. So when you cut into that pie, we'll have something to cut into. So just go round and round. and tuck your crust in. Then you can make it. pretty any way you want to. And you know what? Some of the best pies. and cakes ain't pretty but they take- uh oh! Got a little over ambitious with that one. The hardest thing is getting. your dough in there completely. Completely perfect. So you'll have that dough. about the same amount all the way around. So there you go. Once you get it in there, then you decide, you know, how you want to do it. The fork, the fork is definitely the easiest. But sometimes I'll do it just. like I'm doing right now. Just take my fingers and pinch it. Just like that. All right, so now I am going to fork it. Teresa, would you get me out a piece of parchment paper please, dear? And my beads You know where the beads are? They're over there in the baking center. Thanks- Oops! I didn't realize I was so strong today. Wow. Wow I just snatched. that puppy right on out. And I don't too much care. 'cause as long as it tastes good that's all that matters to me. So I'm gonna prick the sides because there's no way that we can put weights on the side. So we're just gonna have to rely on, I just got that crust in. that pan uneven, Eddie. You see what I did? - [Eddie] That side's a little higher. - Uh huh. But it will be so good. - [Eddie] Buttermilk pie's. kind of rustic, that's okay. - Yeah. Buttermilk pie is not one of those fancy fancy desserts. All right, I'm gonna. press those beads down. These are like ceramic, a ceramic bead. Now when I don't have, there was a time where I. didn't have any of this stuff. So I just used dried black. eye peas to weight it down. And that should be plenty. - [Teresa] Is that going in the oven? - It's going in the oven, sister! - [Teresa] So I think we. cook it what, for 15 minutes? - Let's see what my notes say. Pre heat oven to 425. That's a pretty hot oven. Bake on lower rack of. the oven for 10 minutes. And then we're going to. carefully remove the weights, I'll have to bring the pie back in here, and we gonna let it cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. - [Teresa] Before we start the filling. - Y'all, Eddie just walked in the kitchen bringing a package that was. just delivered to our house from my buddy and Eddie's. buddy, Allison Waggoner hey darling, how are you? Thank you so much. We talked to Allison the other day, and she said, be on the. lookout for a package because I'm sending you and Eddie a little goody, little goody box. If you're not familiar. with Waggoner's chocolates, her family has been in. the chocolate business for a hundred years and their chocolate is so good. So I'm gonna munch on. the rest of my turtle while I show y'all the. ingredients that go inside that pitiful looking pie. I just put in the oven. Okay, got a cup and a half of sugar, melted butter, I'll go ahead. and put that in right now. Now let's see, is this,. this is pumpkin pie spice Right, Teresa? - [Teresa] Yes ma'am. - Yes. - [Teresa] These are all for Thanksgiving. - It sounds like Thanksgiving, doesn't it. I think we all just. associate pumpkins and- - [Teresa] But you said you normally do it with cinnamon, right? So if you didn't want the pumpkin flavor you could do a cinnamon. Oh yeah, yeah. You can substitute, you. know, whatever you like. But, here's the deal. This spiced buttermilk pie is in my Southern baking cookbook. In fact, you can get it right here, if you are in the market. for a baking book. To me it is the best baking book. If you're a baker, it'd. make a wonderful gift to yourself or to somebody else. But anyway, this one. also has a topping on it where most buttermilk pies, you know, they're just like an egg. custard pie, you know? No toppings, but- - [Teresa] We're making this fancy. - Yeah. Yeah. I can't wait to show y'all the topping. All right, so now I'm gonna add my flour. Another bite of turtle. (laughing) - [Teresa] Most important thing. (whisking) - The recipe calls for half a. teaspoon of vanilla flavoring, but I don't think I've. ever in my whole life used a half a teaspoon of vanilla. I just love it. (whisking) (phone ringing) Now, whose phone is that? Is that yours, Teresa? - [Teresa] That would be mine. - Well, tell them we don't want any - [Teresa] It's the town. - Oh, ha ha! We do want some! Now I'm adding my buttermilk. (whisking) And last but not least,. I'm gonna add one more bite Got two out of that one. Allison Waggoner thank you so much. Allison was my first. hostess when it was Evine? - [Eddie] Right. - And then they changed. the name to Shop HQ? - [Eddie] Shop HQ, right. And now she is with- - the Beakman Brothers, right? - [Eddie] Beakman Boys. - Beakman Boys. They're not. brothers, they're partners. I'm adding my salt. So she does a great job at Beakman Boys. So I hope you're doing well. I'm fine as frogs fair now,. having eaten my turtle. I'm just gonna beat these up a little bit. (whisking) All right, now I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to let my pie crust cool for about 15 minutes. - [Teresa] I just took it out the oven. - Okay, good. - [Teresa] And removed the beads - Good. - [Teresa] So now it seems- - Doesn't have any humps in it does it? The pie crust. - [Teresa] What now? - Did it have any humps or. bubbles in the pie crust - [Teresa] It does not. - And when you remove the beads, y'all, just remember they're hot as a $3 pistol. So you don't wanna burn yourself when you're taking out. that parchment paper. So 15 minutes, I'll be putting this in and then I'll share. the topping with y'all. Look at my kind of pitiful pie crust. But that's all right.. That's where I tore it. I'm covered it with filling. All right, so this is. our buttermilk filling, and I'm just gonna pour. that into our crust. See, it'll almost cover. the little ugly spots. You know, that's the thing about food. Kinda like people, you know,. if I choose to love you, I just love your warts and all. And that's a wart! I mean, I'm scraping you. Drop out and make it. come up as high as I can. Yum yum. Okay, Miss Teresa, ma'am. - We're gonna put it in an oven for 20 to 25 minutes until set. - Uh huh, okay. Now, while our buttermilk. pie is baking, y'all, I'm gonna go ahead and make the topping because this will go into the refrigerator until I'm ready to serve the first slice. And then I'll put a nice fat. dollop of this topping on it. Now to make our topping,. I've got 3/4 a cup of heavy whipping cream. I've got a fourth of a cup of buttermilk. I've got, oh gosh, what was that, a fourth of a cup of confectioners sugar, a dash of salt, half a teaspoon of vanilla, and I've got my ground nutmeg. I cannot, I hadn't seen my. fresh nutmeg since we moved so I don't know where in. the heck it got off too. 'Cause I love fresh grated nutmeg. It's just wonderful. But I'm gonna be using ground on this. All right. Now I'm just gonna beat these until they're nice and kind of stiff. So you just need to beat. your topping ingredients until it forms soft peaks. And then, like I said,. we're gonna put it on as we serve the pie. I don't wanna put this on the. whole pie like a meringue. And this will last up to three. days in the refrigerator. So if it takes you three days. to eat your buttermilk pie, your topping is good to go. So as I was putting our. topping in the refrigerator, I said, I remember using. a little more sugar, than what the chopping calls for. So I decided I'm coming back with it and gonna add a little bit more sugar. 'Cause that buttermilk. gives it a real tart flavor. And I wanna make sure the sweet comes. So I've probably added. maybe three tablespoons of white granulated sugar to it. And to me that's perfect for my pallet, or the other way, it. was still a little tart and I remember increasing. that sugar on that pie. But there you go. And it's not gonna get as. stiff as whipped cream, if you were just beating. cream and sugar together. You know, it get so stiff, it'll. almost turn back to butter. I have beat it where it. turned back to butter and I just added some salt. to it and used it as butter. But to me it's perfect this way. I've stood it as long as I can y'all to taste this spiced buttermilk pie. So I can't stand it. It's not completely cooled, but, you know, if it if it spreads out, it's just gonna have to spread out. Cause there's three of us waiting to taste this pie. - [Teresa] And the only one. that has patience is Eddie. - Yep, he is. He's the only one with any patience. All right, here we go. Can't do this- oo! Uh huh. And I love the way it. comes to like a crusty top. Now this is our topping for it. - [Eddie] That looks like. it has a custard base. - I know. That's that. little nutmeg to go on it. It could stand to get a little bit cooler. Now I certainly wouldn't top. this pie with this topping. I would dollop up each. piece as you cut a piece. And also the directions. tell you for your topping to just put everything. in the bowl and beat it. I would recommend, highly recommend, that you beat your heavy. cream first until it's firm. And then add your other ingredients. Because otherwise it's gonna. be hard to get it stiff. So. I think I do need a fork. It looks so good. I just adore buttermilk pie. Oh, and that topping, it's. just kind of different. Mm. I just love buttermilk pie. It's delicious, y'all. Y'all got to come cut your piece. It's so good, and it feels. like I need to turn around and see my turkey sitting back there. Cause it just tastes like Thanksgiving. I need a moment, y'all. Love and best wishes!;['postres']
esujFbZYbAs.json;- So hello, everybody. I'm gonna share with y'all on this video a recipe if you're doing. like a bridal luncheon or a baby shower or a bridge. party, whatever you're doing, and I'm gonna show you how. it would be done the fan, no, I'm gonna tell you how you. would do it in a fancy way. And I don't know if you. can see from that picture. That's the fancy way, but I'm gonna show y'all. the lazy man's family way. So I'm gonna start,. I'm starting the recipe kind of back, back-ass-wards. This is for the topping, but. it's got to be refrigerated, so I'm gonna use one. envelope of plain gelatin and then I'm gonna just pour. the cold water over that, and let it sit for, oh. gosh, about a minute. And then I'm gonna add, after it sits, I'm gonna add 1/3 of a cup. of boiling water to it. And over here, I have. two cups of heavy cream. That looks like a cup of sugar. - [Teresa] It's actually 2/3. - [Paula] 2/3, and I've got about-- - [Teresa] 1/2 a cup. - 1/2 a cup of chopped, diced. Maraschino cherries, y'all. And because I have to see it,. I'm doing this part first, but this is a pretty,. pretty, pretty little-- - [Teresa] Oh, there's also. some cherry juice sitting on this little table,. that's gonna go in as well, and I just forgot to. put it up there for you. - I thought this was just. put aside for me to drink, for me to sip on. - [Teresa] It's not. - Okay, I love Maraschino cherries. Okay, our water was boiling, and I'm gonna add 1/3 of a cup of the boiling water over our. cold water and our gelatin. And I'm gonna stir this, make sure it's completely dissolved. Look at that little whisk, isn't it cute? (Paula laughs) - [Teresa] You have all kinds of cute, little whisks just for this. - I do, I do. And you know, if I don't have it, folks are so great out there, they'll send me things. that they really like, which is wonderful. I appreciate it so much. 'Cause I really don't, you know, I don't get out much anymore. - [Teresa] Well, it's too hot right now. - Yeah, it is too hot. Plus, I, you know, with. me not driving anymore, you know, I can't just get out and go. All right, this needs to. sit for about five minutes. I'm gonna do my top, my talking, while the mixer is not running, so I'm gonna beat my whipping cream until it's, you know, kind of bubbly. Kind of bubbly. And then I'm gonna add my. 2/3 a cup of sugar slowly. And then I'm gonna fold. in my diced cherries, my cherry juice, and the gelatin. Okay, so all the sugar's added. Now I'm gonna slowly add my gelatin. (blender whirs) And this is gonna make it real stiff, so it'll do what we want it to do. (blender whirs) That looks good. Make sure I got all the, all. the goody out of the gelatin. All right, so now I'm gonna. fold in our cherry juice and our chopped Maraschino cherries. Cherries make any, any dessert. kind of special, doesn't it? You see a cherry and it's got to be good. So see how pretty that is? You could always add a little. red food coloring to it if you want it a little. pinker, but I think that's nice and it's a soft pink. So in the refrigerator. this goes for two hours, and I'm gonna just stick it. in the refrigerator drawer. Listen, I ain't gonna make y'all suffer watching me mix up a box of brownie mix. So this is what we. started with, box brownie, but we didn't do it by the. instructions on the back, y'all. We added, I think, a 1/3 of a cup of oil, two eggs, 1/4 of a cup of water. - [Teresa] Yes, ma'am. - [Paula] Some chocolate. chips and vanilla. - [Teresa] And vanilla. - Just mix that together. and you wanna bake it on a jelly roll pan, which is a 15x10, and so it's gonna be thin and ... This direction, this ... - [Teresa] I think that it might screw. - You think it might screw? I don't think it do screw. (Paula laughs) Think it's like me. (Paula laughs) Oh, wait, it dos. All right, you would. want to do it this size. - [Teresa] Is this the for being fancy? - [Paula] This is the fancy way. (Paula grunts) (Paula laughs) You know, Teresa, I just. don't have the strength that I used to have. - [Teresa] Which is why we. do it the lazy man's way. - That's right, but this is really pretty. And then our topping, we. would put in a pastry bag, give it a little squirt, and. it would be a nice little bite for a bunch of little ladies. that have gotten together for a shower, or a luncheon,. or a bridge, whatever. Just right, just right for that. - [Teresa] We're not doing it that way. - I don't think we ought to do it either. It's Friday, Teresa. I think, this is so good. I think we just need to frost it. - [Teresa] I'm with you, and guess what? Frosting's already ready. It's been two hours.. - Yes. So what do y'all think? I've shown you how to do the fancy way, if you want to impress somebody, and then I'm gonna show you the way that most families would. likely find it easier to do this way, so-- - [Teresa] This way, it. doesn't look like a recipe that you only make during--. - Right. - [Teresa] The fancy season.. - Right. So I'm just stirring up. my, my whipped cream. Now, if I was gonna do that ... Let me just show y'all. Another thing that you could. do, Teresa, if you didn't want to use the heavy whipping. cream and cherries, you could drizzle melted, you could ice it with a chocolate icing. - [Teresa] What you do. with brownies all the time and they are fabulous.. - I do, I don't like a brownie that I don't frost it. So if you wanted it frosted. or you wanted it this way, either way would work. And we are showing, we're showing y'all from the web that we have piped this in. I'm not gonna put much in there because I'm just gonna do the one. Come on, stick to that brownie. There you go. Look, you see how pretty. that would be on a plate? Really prim and proper. and ladylike, isn't it? - [Teresa] Now just. dump it all over the top and we'll be good to go. - Yes.. (Paula laughs) - [Teresa] This is how we really do it. - Yes, you know, there's several. ways you can handle this. You could, you could cut this into squares and have your topping in the refrigerator and top it as you go, as you eat it. Because once you put this. topping on it, y'all, it's gonna have to be. refrigerated, I'm afraid. So I'm just gonna do part of it. And then, oh, after I cut. this off and cut it up, I'm gonna frost the rest. with the chocolate icing. Or you could put this on. a tray and pour ganache. - [Teresa] Or white chocolate. I mean, you could just. drizzle with white chocolate. - Yeah, and--. - [Teresa] Caramel. There's so many things you could do. - And you could top it with. a almond or, or a pecan. So there we go. Hard to frost those holes. So that's it. Morning glory, it's delicious and easy. (loud thumps) Y'all, everything's all right. They're putting an awning up out back because it's so hot here that. the sun goes down that way and it is so blooming hot back there, you can't go on the porch, so they're putting in an awning for us. The house is not collapsing. (Paula laughs);['postres']

preserve so y'all sit back it's a tea party y'all let's go ahead and get started i've got everything gathered here that we're gonna need to make the cake part of our strawberry shortcake and i'm gonna use two cups of all-purpose flour there we go just right into the bowl i'm gonna pour it to my flour i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of salt one tablespoon of baking powder three tablespoons of sugar now i'm gonna cut in one stick of very cold butter that i've cut up into pieces now you'll want to make sure that this is not at room temperature cause we don't want our butter to like melt into our flour we want it to be cut in so there's little chunks of butter all right so we're just gonna pulse this until we see that that butter is cut into that flour one more little faults all right there we go yeah that looks good almost looks like a little bit like cornmeal very quickly the food processors work great for that now i'm just going to transfer that to my bowl i'm gonna make a well and i'm gonna add two thirds a cup of half and half and just work that into my my buttery dough i remember when i was a young girl my mama would go to the grocery store and she would buy those little cakes

biscuit for strawberry shortcakes so i'm excited about making these today all right i've got all of our half and half mixed in now i'm just gonna take our spatula and i've got some flour up here on my counter and i'm just gonna put our dough into that flour and you can see that our dough is very very sticky so that little bit of flour is gonna give me just enough to kind of knead into that dough so i can touch it without it sticking to me and this is just perfect now i'm not even gonna have to roll this dough out i'm just gonna pat it out three quarters to an inch thick and you can see how easy and quick that was to get our shortcakes together a beautiful fat biscuit i'm just going to add this to the tray over here that i got going now you'll want to make sure when you're making your dough for your strawberry shortcake that you don't overwork your dough you want to just handle it as little as possible okey doke so i've got these on a cookie sheet now i want to just brush the tops with a little half and half and i'm doing that for two reasons the half and half will give a little sheen to our shortcakes plus i've got a little extra sugar for these bad boys and that half and half will give the sugar something to stick to you know this is a dessert so i want my biscuits to be sweet okay so we're gonna pop this in to a preheated oven at 400 degrees in they go and while those are baking i'm gonna come over here and i'm gonna finish up my strawberries i had gotten them started now i'm using like one quart of strawberries the larger ones i'm quartering the smaller strawberries i'm just cutting in half had a junior strawberry and a granddaddy strawberry there all right so into the bowl they go [Music] i'm gonna toss them with a fourth of a cup of sugar and that'll sugar will

while we were on break i took the biscuits out of the oven and look how beautiful these little biscuit cakes look i'm gonna use a serrated knife so that they won't crumble on me look in here see that oh my goodness the girls are gonna love it um now i'm gonna come in here with my strawberries just kind of pile them up on there and now i'm gonna go in for that juice and now i'm gonna come back in here and put my lid on it put a few more strawberries on top of that and you can't have strawberry shortcake without some nice sweetened whipped cream can you and some of my beautiful mint from the garden look at that look at that beautiful shortcake just glistening y'all don't mind if i go ahead and taste do you i don't know what to say it's so delicious i know my girlfriends are gonna love it we'll move on down here because i want to start on the next dish and i said pecan squares now i've got four eggs here waiting to go into my bowl and i'm cracking those one at the time i'm gonna crack them first and drop them in this little small bowl so i can just give them the old eagle line make sure those birds were flying straight that day and so far so good they look great got a little bit of a shell there you know i don't know about your town but savannah has gotten some nice tea rooms and some tea shops here in the last few years and people are really into them especially women all right i've gotten my four eggs beaten now i'm gonna add a one pound box of light brown sugar the whole box goes in there and sometimes your brown sugar will clump up on you you know if you need to just take your whisk and go down in there and break up that brown sugar think that last chunk got them all so in our double boiler it goes so there we go we're gonna cook this for about 20 minutes or until it gets to 240 degrees now while that's cooking come on over here and we can be mixing up our dry ingredients for our pecan squares i'm going to measure out one and a half cups of all-purpose flour so that's a half and this is a full cup i'm gonna add a half a teaspoon of baking powder there we go and i've got one and a half cups of chopped pecans that i'm gonna just toss that into our flour mixture there we go all right let's come back over here and give our pot a stir we'll stick our thermometer in and just kind of see where we're at okay so it's ready so i'm just gonna pour our eggs and brown sugar that's been cooking over our flour and our pecans and before you know it we're going to be snacking on fabulous pecan squares and i'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and then we're just gonna stir that up just like that just mix that until our flour is incorporated okey-doke that easy i'm just gonna pour that into our pan that i've buttered and floured okay i'm just gonna spread those out you can see because this is partially cooked kind of wants to be a little stubborn now we cooked our shortcakes at 400 degrees i've lowered my oven temperature to 350 so in they go 22 to 25 minutes and when we come back i'm going to be making some wonderful sour cream scones i hope y'all are enjoying the show and i want to hear from you tell me what recipes or videos you'd

y'all hear lady bird she's wanting me to come out there and talk to her all right three tablespoons of sugar this kind of sounds like our shortcakes that we did for the strawberry shortcake doesn't it it's a little different though two tablespoons of bacon powder one teaspoon of baking soda and that goes and a half a teaspoon of salt now i've got five tablespoons of real real cold butter and we're gonna cut that in until again it looks like about the consistency of cornmeal that looks good all right now i'm gonna add one cup or one eight ounce container of sour cream and to shake up our little prissy tea party i'm gonna pull out my egg separator that says more paula than prissy and i'm just gonna look at that y'all i just love it i know you kids out there love it too mom and daddy may think it's sickening but i just love it it's very very important that we take time to laugh and have fun and that's definitely one of those things that just makes me laugh all right so let's mix this together you can see our dough is starting to form a ball in there all right there we go now i'm gonna bring this out onto my cutting board and i'm gonna put a little flour up here because once the ingredients got mixed together it became very soft again okay so i'm gonna just take my spatula and get the rest of that out okay oh and this looks very good now i'm just going to pat this out about one inch thick kind of pat it into a square i'm going to come in here and i'm going to cut this into four squares and i'm gonna cut them diagonally one time giving us eight triangles okay that's great i'm gonna come over here and i'm gonna get my grandmother's spatula and just transfer those to my baking sheet just like that the dough is beautiful isn't it [Music] okie doke last one on and i'm gonna brush them with half and half because it's gonna give it that little bit of shine and instead of using regular sugar i'm gonna use a raw sugar it's so pretty to work with i'm just gonna sprinkle those tops of those scones with lots of that raw sugar [Music] all right so in the oven our scones go 350 degrees for about 12 to 14 minutes okay so the scones are in the oven about 12 to 14 minutes

eXd5SSrXM_Y.json;- You know, I love a state fair. Doesn't everybody love a state fair? And you can get some foods. that are so bad for you, can't ya? So it's a good thing that we can't just get to. a state fair every weekend, but you know those little. things that they fry up that has that Oreo. cookie in the center? We know we're not. supposed to be eating 'em, but isn't it so good? And uh, I don't even think Georgia has. a state fair, do we, Theresa? We don't have a state fair, do we? - [Eddie] We used to. have the Savannah Fair, but I don't even think. we have that anymore. - Yeah, but that's not a state fair. A state fair is huge. And I have been to state. fairs that are just. - [Eddie] We've been to the Minnesota one a couple times, but that's. - We did, you and I did? - [Eddie] You, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I know I spoke at one of 'em. - [Eddie] Yeah, actually I think you've done the air fryer or some. air fryer demos there. - Did a demo? Oh, yeah. (Paula laughing) Probably did. Well, I'm gonna make us. some little fried Oreos, and you can use, to do these, you can use, I'm using puff pastry, but. you can also use those, that dough that you buy in the can. What is it, what is it? Crescent roll dough, yeah. So you can also use that. I've just always been a. big fan of puff pastry. So I'm cutting these, I'm using my largest biscuit cutter, and I'm stretching my dough. out even a little bit bigger. And I'm taking my double. stuffed Oreo cookie, and I'm just bringing the. dough up around that cookie. Just kind of mashin' it down. And I'm gonna leave this side up, and almost make it like. a little beggars' purse, so there we go. And I'm sealin' it with. just a little bit of water to make it tacky. So that's what y'all caught me doing. And the fair that we have here in the Southeast Georgia Fair, Eddie. I don't think I've seen fried. - [Eddie] Yeah, it's. - Oreos there. Have you? - [Eddie] No, but I definitely remember the Minnesota one, there. was fried everything. - Fried everything. I remember years ago when I, it didn't start out to be that, but by the time I ended up with the show, I was making a cheeseburger,. and I did not like making, my bread wasn't fresh. And of course I had a guest on the show, and I didn't want to. give her a cheeseburger with hard bread. So I had a plate of donuts,. Krispy Kreme donuts, sitting up there on the counter. So I touched it, and oh, it felt so fresh. So I said we are gonna have. our cheeseburger on this donut. Well, I took two of those donuts, and just dressed 'em the same way I would have dressed a cheeseburger on a bun. that was the best hamburger. I've ever tasted, y'all. In fact, I went back into the bedroom. I asked 'em if we could cut for a minute, I went back into the bedroom. where Michael was sleeping, he had worked all night, bringing in and parkin' ships. And I said, Michael,. you just got to wake up long enough to taste this, because I won't be. making any more of these. These are like a once in a lifetime thing. And it was so good, y'all. And before I could turn around, I heard that state fairs were. doing donut cheeseburgers. So it was good enough. for people at the fair to duplicate it. They were just out of this world. So I'm gonna take our Oreo cookies that we have got. encased in this puff pastry, and I'm gonna spray 'em real good. And then I'm gonna put. 'em in the air fryer. I don't know what I did. before an air fryer, y'all, I swear to Peter I don't know. I don't like to think about it. Now let's see, I can't remember, this recipe was in my air fryer cookbook. Let's see, says air fry. for five minutes on 350. So that's what we're gonna do. Five minutes. And we gon' have deep fried Oreos. Now what could we do to make these, give 'em a little twist. What do y'all think we could do? - [Eddie] Frosting, dunk in frosting. - Dunk it in frostin'? Great idea, Eddie. (Paula laughing) Or we could just drizzle it with. - [Theresa] Chocolate? - Chocolate? Yes. What kind of chocolate,. you think like Nutella, or? - [Theresa] Any of 'em. - Any of 'em? (Paula laughing) I would like some nuts in mine. I just love nuts. So gosh, what else could we do? - [Theresa] We could just put. confectioners' sugar in them. Sprinkle 'em. - Yeah. You can mix up confectioners' sugar, and a little chocolate, their powder chocolate that. you use to make frostings with. Mix that together, and dust 'em with that. The chocolate and the,. and the powdered sugar. Yes. So we got five minutes to see what we got. So if you're craving a fried. Oreo from your state fair, and there's no state fair in sight, remember this one, put this. one in your little recipe log. When I first started. filmin' a show, I did it in, at Millbrook up in upstate New York. And there was a state. fair going on up there. around Poughkeepsie or somewhere. Anyway, we went to it. I don't know who I was with. 'Cause I didn't know anybody, but it was, the state. fairs are so much fun. - [Theresa] The big ones. Remember when we went to. the Minnesota State Fair? - Yes, the Minnesota State Fair is huge. - [Theresa] Huge. - Huge. Alright. Let's see. How long has it been now, y'all? Eddie just said it smells. like the state fair in here. And you know what would have made 'em prettier and glossier, Eddie,. that I could have done? I could done it in egg yolks,. brushed 'em in egg yolks. And that would have. given it a polished look. Some of 'em, I didn't. close up all the way. 'Cause I wanted to see how it'd look with a little of the. chocolate peakin' out of it. And that's what it looks. like totally covered. But I like the way they look. like little beggar purses. And I looked for some cocoa, y'all, to mix with some powdered sugar. But, I didn't have any, must be in storage. (Paula laughing) That very well could be in storage. Sure enough, along with my bakin' stuff. I think I like it better. like that, totally closed. So maybe I should eat one. that's not closed all the way. Right? You reckon these are real hot? Yes. (Paula laughing) Yes, they are. - [Eddie] Get a glass of milk. - Mm. (bell dinging) Mm. I do love me a puff pastry. I tell you what. Tell you children what. Then I can't find anything. I can't wait to. I can't find anything. You see this big thing sittin' in my face? I couldn't find it. (plastic crinkling) Gonna put just a little. powdered sugar on it. 'Cause that puff pastry is not sweet. The Oreo cookie is, but, so there we go. Look, here comes Theresa. (Paula laughing) - [Eddie] You could do. like your sand cookies. - Can't her ass out of that chair. - [Eddie] Roll it in powdered sugar like your sand cookies that you had. - [Theresa] Oh yeah. - Oh my gosh, this is so good. Would you like one of. my fried Oreo cookies? - [Theresa] Yes, please. - Well what are you doin'? Eat the whole thing. You know you can eat the whole thing. - [Theresa] I know. I just know it's gonna be hot. Are they not that bad? - Yes, it's hot. - [Theresa] Oh and you know. I got the double stuff. - Mhm. - [Theresa] That's important, a note. - Theresa did go get the. double stuffed Oreos. - [Theresa] And they have. all kind of Oreo flavors now. - I mean! - [Theresa] Peanut butter, mint. - Somebody told me that. they had an almond one. - [Theresa] I mean, it's crazy. - But I can't find it anywhere. And every store I go. in, I look for 'em, and. - [Theresa] You could make. these for St. Patrick's Day with the mint ones. - Mhm. That'd be great. Mm. - [Theresa] Just when you think. a Oreo can't get any better. - We beg to differ, don't we? (Paula laughing) So good, y'all. You know what, you could mix up food colorin', and brush your pastry, whatever you were usin',. either the puff pastry, sheets of puff pastry, or. either the crescent rolls that come in the can. You could brush 'em with food colorin', and make 'em any color you wanted. - [Theresa] That's a good children's, I mean that's so easy. - Uh huh, so easy for a child. - [Theresa] To do. - And then put the sprinkles on it. - [Theresa] Mhm, I mean. you could do a lot with it. - Mm! - [Theresa] And not heat up the kitchen. - No, uh-uh. It's just as cool in here. And, this is one way to beat a state. fair if you ain't got one. (Paula laughing) Isn't it? Love y'all, have a great day.;['postres']
fE3jU28n9SA.json;"- Hey everybody, I'm Bobby Deen. Welcome to the show, thanks for tuning in. I'm filling in for my mom, Paula, while she is recovering from, most of you know that my. mom had a little eye surgery up at Duke University last week. I'm happy to report that. the surgery was a success, and Mom is feeling real good. But she's not quite camera ready, so I'm gonna fill in a little bit for her while she's on the mend. We were talking about this before, and I think that a lot of. people have been asking for, well I know that a lot of people have been asking for lighter recipes, because the way that my mom cooks is fantastic and it's wonderful, but it's full of flavor, and we all know that. That's one of the endearing things about my mom and home cooking, is that it's just so good, right? Foods can be good, and they can. be a little bit lighter too. So today what I'm gonna do is show you a lighter. version of Peach Cobbler, which is something that my mom. and my beautiful Aunt Peggy, and my Grandpa Paul, my brother, we all, everybody, makes Peach Cobblers. We're in Georgia so it's. sort of a no-brainer. Peach Cobbler, Blackberry Cobbler, all those things are so good. And they're easy to make, and they can be lightened. up in really simple ways. Anyhow let's get started, and I'll show you how to. lighten up a Peach Cobbler. This recipe comes from a fine cookbook, one of my favorites actually. It's called ""From Mama's Table to Mine"", and it's by one of my. favorite authors, myself. Right above my name there you'll see that this book did fairly well. It went to number one on the ""New York Times"" bestseller list. So that's pretty good, I'm proud of that. Anyhow this Peach Cobbler. from ""Mama's Table to Mine"", I hosted a show called. ""Not My Mama's Meals"", and the whole premise of the show was to take all my mom's recipes and then lighten them up. in really simple ways. So that kept me busy for a long time. And this is one of the results. of that show and the book. So we're going to start by. mixing together some peaches, look here, I don't have a problem with canned peaches, or with frozen fruits, or anything like that at all. If you're cooking at. home it's perfectly fine. You could use fresh peaches, and in Georgia here we get them. It's laborious to get a. bunch of fresh peaches, and cut them all up, it's simple to go canned or frozen, so whatever you like. But we're gonna start off by. mixing together our peaches, a little brown sugar, that's gonna be three. tablespoons of brown sugar. We're gonna mix in some flour, a little lemon juice, and some cinnamon. I'm just gonna use a wooden spoon here and mix these things together just gently. I'll fold them together, because I don't wanna tear my peaches up. That's beautiful fruit, and it should stay together. When we opened our restaurant, we started our business in 1989, and our business was. born out of necessity, like a lot of other businesses. We were people trying to make our way, and what we knew was food, what my mom really knew was food. So that was the direction that we went in. And when we opened our first restaurant, of course I started. off as the pot scrubber and the dishwasher and everything else. But soon enough I moved into the slot of making all the desserts. So for years if you came. to The Lady restaurant, this is before we were The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah, if you came to The Lady restaurant at 45 Eisenhower Drive in Savannah, Georgia, and ate any time between 1989 and 1996, 1995 actually, and had dessert it would. have been made by my hands. I made all the cobblers,. I made all the cookies, I made all the banana puddings, I made all that stuff. So I really got a good. feel for making pastries then really early on. It's funny how our roles have evolved in the restaurant over the years. You go from one thing to the next. When you're a business owner, when you're a small business owner, and I think especially in. the restaurant business, you've gotta be able to wear all the hats. You've gotta able to do. anything, and everything. So if somebody don't show up that day, you'd better be able to. know how to wait the tables, and you'd better know. how to make the cobbler, and you'd better know. how to make the coffee, and the grits and the. eggs, and all that stuff. Oh boy, do I have some funny stories and memories from those days. If there's time we'll share them. So I've got the peaches mixed together with a little flour, a little cinnamon, a little baking powder,. a little lemon juice. And we're gonna go ahead and put them into a small. casserole dish here. This is a nine-inch casserole dish. I've greased it a little bit, because I don't want this stuff to stick. So I just sprayed it. with a little non-stick. And I'm gonna go ahead. and pour that mixture in, and just spread it out. evenly in the casserole dish. It looks really pretty already. This is a really, really great recipe, and I think you're gonna like it. So what I've gotta do. is put this in the oven, I've got my oven preheated at 425, and I'm gonna put this in for about 10 minutes and let it bake. So I'll go ahead and do that, and then we'll come back and then we'll see what it. looks like in 10 minutes. And we're back. So my peaches are in the. oven in the casserole dish, they've been in for about five minutes, so we've got about five minutes more. So now we're gonna make the. dough for the Peach Cobbler. We talked about it being really easy to lighten recipes up in. really elementary ways. But I don't think I talked about how I'm lightening this. particular recipe up. I'm using unsalted butter,. that's one great way. And I'm also using light brown sugar, so those are two really easy ways to start to dial back. If you make really small. cuts all along the way throughout the recipe, then it's gonna equal a big total. In fact this Peach Cobbler recipe, if you compare it, and I know that my mom's cobbler is one of everybody's favorites out there, so I really do want you. to make her Peach Cobbler, enjoy it, and then I want you to make mine as well and hopefully enjoy it too, and compare the two of them,. and let us know what you think. Because my whole point. with lighten up this food is that you can have the. things that you like more often if you can lighten them up a little bit. I'm not saying don't ever. have the full Peach Cobbler, I'm just saying every once in a while, and then if you want to. have it more regularly then you can have a lighter version of it. So let's make the dough. I'm going to add into a medium bowl the rest of my brown sugar, a cup of flour, a little salt and a little baking soda. (buzzing) And there is my timer,. salt and baking soda. There's my timer for my peaches. So let's take a look at. them and see how they look. It's been 10 minutes. Oh, they look great, yeah, that's perfect. Look how beautiful they look. After we finish the recipe, this is gonna cook for another 25 minutes, so I don't wanna overcook the peaches in the oven right now, because they've still got. some more cooking to do. So we're going to whisk together the brown sugar, the all purpose flour, light brown sugar, all purpose flour, baking soda and a little bit of salt. This is classic stuff right here, these are all expected ingredients. What I like about this recipe is that it's really quick too. This is a total of 30 minute cooking time, and minimal ingredients. I think that people like easy. Cooking should be fun, and it shouldn't be terribly difficult. Good food doesn't have to be complicated, I've said that many times, many times. So I've got that whisked together nicely, and now we're gonna cut in our butter. It's five tablespoons of butter. Now that's another way to lighten it up, I don't remember exactly how many sticks of butter my. mama's recipe calls for, but it's way more than this. I'm gonna go ahead and cut this in using a pastry cutter. And my butter is a little bit soft, it's kind of room temperature. It makes it easier to work with to me. So let's go ahead and cut that butter in until it resembles, well you'll see. It'll look like it's supposed to look. So we'll cut that in until it looks like sort of a course meal, and that's looking real, real good. Who doesn't like Peach Cobbler? I think there's nobody that. doesn't like a Peach Cobbler, I love it. To make things even a. little bit easier on me when mixing this up, because you can see it's chunky, I said course, and this definitely is. It's chunky looking. Just keep on going, and keep on going. I could take another break here, but I'm not going to, I'm gonna let you watch me do this. Just cut that butter in,. cut it in, cut it in. - [Paula] Do you have trouble me talking to you, Bobby? - [Bobby] Who is that there? (laughing) - [Paula] It's your mama. - It's my mama, should we see her? - [Paula] No. - You look great. - [Paula] Oh son. - All right, so we've cut in the butter, and the last thing that we're gonna add is a quarter cup of really. hot water, boiling water. (cellphone ringing) - [Paula] As soon as I walk off. - [Bobby] As soon as I walk. off my phone starts ringing. Right, so this is quarter. cup of really hot water. And we're just gonna continue to mix it with our pastry cutter here. Yeah, this is looking exactly perfect. Look how good. Now Peach Cobbler is made. to be eaten with ice cream, gosh it's so good. I remember growing up, my mama would sit on the front porch of whatever apartment we were. living in at the time, because what we did best was move. Oh boy, we moved a lot, we moved a lot. But my mama, everywhere we moved, would have an ice cream maker and I remember that thing just as well. It was silver and black, and it was electric, it. plugged into the wall, and it had a big bucket. You'd have the metal urn down. in the center of all this ice. And you pour rock salt all over it to keep the ice from melting. and becoming a watery mess. And Mama used to make just. the best homemade ice creams. She would make strawberry ice. cream, and vanilla ice cream. Those are the two that I remember. It seems like mama would make. a butter pecan ice cream. Gosh. The good thing about food too especially desserts,. and cobblers, and pies and things like that, is they just bring back. such wonderful memories. All I've gotta do is get started cooking, and then I just start. thinking about my mom, or my grand-mama, or. whoever the case may be, my Aunt Peggy. We come from a family that loves to cook, and you know what, I'm gonna teach my children to cook. My wife likes to cook, it's just a great, I'm. gonna use the word skill, because it is, cooking's a good skill to have. But it's also fun to. cook with your family. Everybody can take on a role. It's just good. I think that people should cook together with their families. and with their friends. There's just always good. conversation to be had, and things to be learned. It's just good. We should all go out to eat and enjoy good food too. But cooking together at. home is a great thing. I have got my dough pretty. well mixed together. So I'm gonna use an ice cream scoop. Why did I start talking about ice cream? Yeah, I started talking about ice cream because ice cream goes. very well with cobbler. With my lightened up. version of Peach Cobbler, I might suggest, they. make some really good ice creams out there now that you can find in the freezer section of your grocery stores that are really lighter and. they've come a long way. Or you can get a nice gelato. to go on the side with this. Whatever you like. I'm gonna use an ice cream scoop here, and I'm just going to plop in a few pieces of our dough right on top. Looks good, looks real good. Try to get it everywhere. This is gonna be a recipe that you enjoy. I think you'll like it. But like I said earlier, I really wanna hear from you, so try it, see what you think, see how it compares to my mama's, or yours, you might have a great cobbler recipe that you like to do. Compare it to yours, see what you think. My hands are clean, I've. washed them 100 times today. I'm just gonna use my fingers to move that around a little bit and make sure there's a little. bit of dough everywhere. Look at that, I predict good things happening in about the next 25 minutes. Look at this, that came out of the oven, I can still handle it. Into a 425 degree oven. for about 25 more minutes. So hang in there, and we'll come back, and we'll see what my cobbler looks like. So my cobbler smells delicious, and it's time to take it out. Let's see what it looks like. I wish you could smell that cobbler, look at that thing. - [Paula] Oh my goodness, Bobby Deen. - [Bobby] Yeah, it's beautiful. Now my mom was just asking me how I lightened this cobbler up. So let's talk about a traditional Peach. Cobbler for just a second. When you make a traditional Peach Cobbler, you always make a simple. syrup on the stove top. A simple syrup would involve quite a bit of white sugar and water, and you just boil it and stir it up and make exactly what it sounds like, a very simple syrup. - [Paula] Yeah, because. those fresh peaches aren't in that syrup. - That's right, so we skipped that, we did not make a simple syrup, and rather than probably. two sticks of butter is what a traditional Peach. Cobbler would call for, I only used five tablespoons. So those are two really simple ways to lighten up this cobbler recipe. We went from, let's see, a. traditional Peach Cobbler before would be 14 grams of fat. and 437 calories per serve. My Peach Cobbler, this exact recipe, is eight grams of fat and. 216 calories per serving. So that's quite a significant difference and really some easy, easy ways. And the proof is in the. pudding so to speak. You see how beautiful this. cobbler is right in front of me. - [Paula] You might have. your mama using less butter. (laughs) - [Bobby] Well, we'll see. Yeah, so it looks great. Let's see how it tastes. Boy, look at that, that is a beautiful cobbler. And I've got a partner in crime sitting over there at the table that's gonna be ready to be my co-pilot and taste tester. This looks so, so good. - [Paula] There's ice cream. sitting out over here. (laughs) - [Bobby] There is some ice cream. You know what I want to reiterate you all, I used frozen peaches, and that is perfectly okay. Frozen fruits are just fine. You don't have to feel guilty. about using a frozen fruit. - [Paula] I like using the frozen better than I do the canned myself. Because they look just so fresh. - [Bobby] A little bit of homemade, not homemade, I wish it was, a little bit of vanilla ice cream on top. And look how great that looks. Okay, Aunt Peggy. - [Aunt Peggy] Yes, I'm waiting. (laughing) - All right, it's gonna. be super, super hot, so be careful. - I will. - I would mix in a little. bit of that ice cream, and get it cold a little bit. - Bobby, it just looks delicious. And your presentation. is out of this world. - Thank you so much. (moaning) It is good, Aunt Peggy? - It's excellent. - I agree. - [Paula] You can probably. taste those peaches so good because it's. not overly sweet I bet. Is that correct? - It's just perfect. - Can't do any better than perfect. So please make my mama's. traditional Peach Cobbler recipe, enjoy it, and then make mine and compare. them and see what you think. And let us know what you think. My Aunt Peggy says it's perfect. Bye you all.";['postres']
FQw8Re95Y8U.json;"- It's summertime, y'all, and if it wasn't for my air fryer, I might not cook all summer long. It's so hot out there. - [Teresa] Yes. - I got in my car yesterday, and my temperature said 97 degrees. It burned my butt. - [Teresa] We went from zero to nothing. It was beautiful and then all of a sudden it was hot and humid. - Over. I don't have a speaker on. I don't have a-- - [Eddie] Oh, I didn't mic you up today. - I just realized I didn't have a mic and I'm just a-talkin'. - [Teresa] Oh well. - Okay, I'll talk loud. and we won't need one. So, anyway, you know, this time of year, most I don't even wanna cut on our stove. So, I'm gonna do, of. course I got my stove on. But, I'm gonna share with y'all a dessert, that tastes so good in the hot weather. And, it's a vanilla bean. caramel icebox dessert. And, Michael and I adore. ice cream (dog barks). What Lulu? Michael and I adore ice cream. In fact, we'll eat every night. We'll eat a little bowl of ice cream, or I buy those little miniature cones, you know the waffle cones. And, we sat here last night, and each ate two of those a piece. 'Cause they miniature,. you know (laughing)? So, this is very, very easy. It takes more time than talent. So, I'm gonna put in two cans. of sweetened condensed milk. (dog barks) What's her problem? - [Teresa] She's not getting attention. - Oh, does she want a treat? - [Teresa] Probably. - Do you want a treat, baby girl? - [Teresa] Is that what. you're looking for? - See if she wants a treat Eddie. See if she wants a treat. - [Teresa] Well come here. - Is that what you want? Is this what you want, oh. - [Teresa] Oh, I'm gonna. be your best friend today. There you go, oh, off she goes. - You didn't make her pay for it. - [Teresa] Oh, I'm sorry. - (laughing) She got a free treat. - [Teresa] And, that was. the last one of this bag, just so you know. - Okay. Well, that's their favorite treat. All right, so this is to. be done in a double boiler. Well, somehow along the way, my double boiler has gotten lost. So, two cans of sweetened condensed milk. And, I'm gonna add a. tablespoon of vanilla paste. That may take a while. for this to come out. See how thick it is. - [Teresa] I have never. used vanilla paste before. - It's a lot richer than-- - -I mean, look at that,. it's like those beans have been cooked down to insane taste. Oh yeah, yeah. Now, we're gonna just stir this on top of this double boiler. that we have rigged up here. It's just a regular pot, whoa, a regular pot with a glass. bowl over boiling water. And, we just gonna let this cook 'til it's a nice caramel color, and that very well could. take two hours, y'all. But, it's worth it, we're. gonna have a big amount. And, I guess you could. always buy caramel sauce at the grocery store. It's certainly less. expensive to do it this way. I'd have to go one more step. further and say it's better. So, two hours, just keeps stirring. The little chocolate paste. is, I meant the vanilla paste is already giving it a little. head start on the color. Thank you, Teresa. You know, there is something. that I wanted to say, just hold on Eddie. You can look at that. sweetened condensed milk, while I'm gone. But, this is important to me, that I talked to Angie Renew. Angie Renew sent me the. sweetest letter, y'all. And, I just loved what she said. She said, ""Dear Miss Paula, ""after watching one of your videos, ""struggling with getting. the dough mixed up ""with your butter, ""I decided to order. this blending for you."" Oh gosh, ""It's stainless. steel, so I hope it will last."" I love this. This would be perfect for Michael to eat, (laughing) or Jamie, he's. got the biggest mouth. ""You can use it for multiple purposes. ""I saw this being used on. another YouTube channel, ""and immediately thought of you. ""I hope it works for you."" How sweet is that? - I'm gonna have to look up. a recipe that we can use it. - I know, well, anytime. you're mixing up biscuit, or any kind of dough. She said, ""Keep your. awesome videos coming. ""After all these years,. you're still my favorite."" That's so sweet, Angie. And, I've got a picture here. I think you may have--I don't know. - [Eddie] I, in fact,. put that together here. - So, we gonna send that. picture to you, Angie, with a little message. But, thank you so much. about thinking about me. And, I will say this, you know, as you get older, you lose the strength in your hands, in your. arms, something fierce. So, I do find that I'm struggling more than I used to have to struggle. So, this is gonna come in so handy. I mean, isn't that a great thing - And, people are so sweet. - I wish I'd have thought. about it, I know it. The folks that watch my channel and have followed me over the years, are the sweetest people in the world. They don't have a mean bone in their body. - Nope, they don't. - Which is so refreshing. So, thank you, Angie. - We'll be back. (laughing) - It's almost there y'all, maybe 30 more minutes. All right, so y'all, it really. did take about two hours. But, it's no trouble, just. as long as you're gonna be in your kitchen. Just give it a stir once in a while. Now, we're gonna add, now that it is gotten the color we want, I just poured in a half a. cup of heavy whipping cream, and then we're gonna put. this in the refrigerator and let it cool completely. And then, we're gonna put our. ice cream dessert together. This is some serious, good stuff, y'all. All right, y'all (rustling). - [Teresa] 63, 63.9, so. we're right there at 63. - All right, so you saying it's. gonna take this whole thing. (rustling) - Whoa, okay (laughing), I like that. All right, so I'm lining our. dish with parchment paper, so when we get ready to take. it out and cut us a slice of ice cream, we can just lift. it out with those handles. And, I may have to swap. jobs with somebody, but I'm gonna see if I can't do it. (clattering) - How about I you get started. - I'm gonna get a hard spoon. (rustling) Yeah, I think if we use the-- - Oh, yeah. - --a firmer (beeping). There we go. That's too soft. So, I'm gonna have to use. something that'll let us dig. Now, you can use any. brand that you would like. I think a coffee ice cream would be good, but I tell you what, here. at the Deen-Brewer house, we love vanilla. All right, now I'm just. gonna take my hands, and pack that down. - I don't think so. - And, that should be like half. Woo, that's cold. The recipe for the ice cream,. y'all, calls for two 14, isn't it two 14 ounce. containers of ice cream? So boy, Heidi, when you start. putting your hands on it, it melts pretty quick. Oh, it's so cold. If you're in a real big hurry, and I have done this,. not in a double boiler, but you have to watch it. very, very closely, you know, just in a regular boiler. Okay, I'm just gonna level this out, and now, I'm gonna add one cup of the caramel sauce over our ice cream. - [Teresa] And we did let that cool down. - Oh yes, you have to let this cool or you will be having a milkshake, instead of a slice of ice cream. If you do this just on top of the stove in a regular sauce pan, that. probably would get much darker. You know, I have in the past, Teresa, caramelized the sweetened condensed milk in boiling water and a sauce. pan on top of the stove. And, that works real good too. Okay, look this at this. You know, now at this point, I'm thinking, who knows, you might like some nuts (laughing), or another spoon full of sugar (laughing). I'm kidding (rustling). All right, now we're gonna put this back in the freezer and let it get hard again. - [Teresa] No, you put. more ice cream on top. - Oh, I'm gonna go ahead and do that now. - [Teresa] Yes, ma'am. - I thought I needed to. let that firm up some. - [Teresa] Nope, we. let everything firm up. Cut it in slices. - That, suits me. - Let me help you. (laughing) Not that I'm much help, but-- - Frozen ice cream is hard to-- - Work with. - Yeah, It's hard to work with. - And, you really are not gonna. need this whole container, 'cause this is a lot. larger than what you need, but at least you can buy one container, instead of having to worry about the two. And, they make it pretty. easy by telling you half. Let me know if you're gonna need more. I don't know that you are, but, knowing you, you will. - Yes. But, that's all right, you know I don't mind using. more than it called for. - Versus less. - Yeah, because you keep. this in the freezer, and all you have to do is. take it out and slice it. - Yeah, this will last. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm shirking on my duties. Okay, go ahead and finish it. - Let me get this down first, please. Yes, ma'am. - That's all we have left. - (laughing) Well, stick it in there. - So, you can't have anymore. Or, either we can eat it. - All right, so we used a whole. gallon of vanilla ice cream, homemade vanilla ice cream. And, we just covered it. with a parchment paper. It's going in the freezer now. And, when we get ready to serve it, I'll be able to pull it out by the handles of the parchment paper. And then, I will drizzle. it with more caramel sauce. This caramel sauce is unbelievable, y'all. Worth every minute. It's not hard, you just. can't leave your kitchen for a couple hours. - [Teresa] Yum. - Uh huh, uh huh (laughing). Look at this wonderful summer dessert. So good. Can I cut you a piece? - [Teresa] Yes, please. - Yay (laughing), yay, yay. Eddie, Eddie (laughing). - [Teresa] Eddie says, ""I said yes."" - Eddie's grinnin'. Oh, my heavens. - [Teresa] Ooey and gooey. - I think we could have left it in the freezer a little bit longer. - [Teresa] You know, we. don't wait very long. We're not too good at waiting. - I know, we're not patient. - [Teresa] People. - I'm so glad that we. used the parchment paper. All right, now, we just. need another little spoon. - [Teresa] I'll grab it for you. - Thank you. This is, yeah, and get. you a spoon to eat with. Okay, there you go, enjoy yourself. - You have to grab your spoon too. - Oh, I am. Eddie can I cut you a piece now? - [Eddie] I'll cut a piece in a minute. - Okay. - [Teresa] He waits, you know, he does this whole dinner thing. - He's got patience. - [Teresa] We don't. - All right, lets see. (scraping) - Michael, girl would. wanna shoot me (laughing), if he knew I was up. here eating this stuff. - [Teresa] Without him? - Think liver lips likes it. - Very much. (laughing) - Okay, Terese. - Put that back in the freezer. - See how easy by putting. that parchment paper in there. Whoa, now y'all this caramel sauce, will keep in the refrigerator. for a couple of weeks. But, I'm thinking, let's freeze it. (laughing) That 'bout. knocked me off my feet. Just when I thought ice cream. couldn't get any better. Oh my goodness, lets go sit. on the back porch and rock. - [Teresa] Love it. - And, eat our ice cream. It's out of this world, y'all. Simple and wonderful. One of the best dishes. (laughing) in the heat.";['postres']
fzc05noFxx8.json;- Y'all have heard me say so many times, how much I enjoy hearing from y'all and you sharing recipes. that mean a lot to you from your childhood. And I got the sweetest. letter from Sean Conant, C-O-N-A-N-T, Conant? Is that how you would pronounce it? - [Eddie] Sounds, sounds right. - But he says, thank you. This is to Ms.Feuger to Theresa. He says, thank you for helping Paula Dean film her YouTube cooking show. My fiancé Logan and I enjoy. watching you, Paula and Eddie every night. And we're from New. Hampshire, just like Eddie. He said, I'm submitting a recipe for you to consider for Paula's show. It's a very honest recipe that. my Grammy Peg used to make. It's very easy to make. and absolutely delicious, and Grammy Peg passed away in 2016. But we think of her very often and we keep her memory alive. with her recipes like this one. And that's what it's all about y'all, keeping those memories alive. And I've got a stray cat that's wanting to get. up here in the picture. Thank you, Theresa. So like I said, that's,. that's what it's all about. Keepin those memories. up front in our head. So I'm going to share with. y'all this cake recipe and it's Grammy Peg's. Cherry Pineapple Dump Cake. And I know we've all. probably made a dump cake at one point in our lives and they are good. And you know, you can change them around. Well, this one calls. for cherry pie filling and crushed pineapple, but Sean tells me to make sure I drain the pineapple real good. And this is, you're going to notice, the only thing I'm going. to have to mess up y'all is that colander right there. No dishes for us'uns. All right. - [Eddie] Have you made. something similar to this? - Oh yes, yes, yes. If you want a quick and easy dessert go-to, these are always great Eddie. Now I have, I used a spray, on my dish so it won't stick. I love cherry pie filling. I love to make fried cherry pies. Oh, they are so delicious. Alright, we're just gonna. spread that out evenly. Then we're gonna add our pineapple. Gonna just give this pineapple a mash to make sure it's drained well, because that's what. Grammy Peg told us to do. I love a good, easy, quick. recipe like this one, cause you never know, you never know, especially when you have kids, who they gonna be bringing home with em. Okay, so now we're just. going to take our cake mix and we are using just a. yellow moist cake, cake mix, and we're going to sprinkle. this over our fruit. Simple, simple, simple. And we just want to make sure that we level it out after. we get it in our pan. - [Eddie] No eggs, no oil? - [Paula] No eggs, no. oil, no nothing Eddie. - [Eddie] Mmm, can't wait to see. - [Paula] It's good, or at least the ones. I've had that are similar were really good. - [Eddie] So this is similar to how you would do your. cobblers a little bit right? - [Paula] Well, no, not kinda really. You make for our cobblers,. we make a batter. - [Eddie] The batter, and you add the dry ingredients. - [Paula] Uh-huh. And then,. we melt a stick of butter in our dish. Okie-doke. Now here comes the part that makes berry berry good. (chuckles) The butter. Calls for 12 tablespoons of melted butter and Sean says if you'll stick. your butter in the freezer, then it'll slice much, much easier. So we're just gonna. distribute this evenly. My cuttin board's dancin on me. Okay. Uh oh. That was two layers. Is that two layers or one? I can't tell. Okay, so this is gonna. have plenty of butter. Cause that was just, that was just a half a stick right there. - [Eddie] It's like a. piece of butter per slice. - [Paula] Yes, that's right Eddie. Just the way we like it. It does make it much easier, I probably didn't have. this butter in the freezer but maybe about 15 minutes. I've got a frog in my throat this morning. I wish he'll hop on out. Oooh-ooh-ohh. I'm liking this a lot. I think the dump cakes. I've made in the past, seems like I've poured. melted butter on it. I don't think I used it like this in pats. So I really, I really like using the pats because you, you know you're gettin it just on every piece. I like it, I like it a lot. - [Theresa] So see you. even learn something new- - [Paula] Mmmhmm. - [Theresa] -with the cake. that you've made a lot. - [Paula] That's right. - [Theresa] That's kind of cool. - [Paula] It is way cool. Like I said, I just love to. know what other folks are doing out there because. we fall into these habits of doing things just one way. And you know, we say, well,. that's the way you do it. But when you get with other people and talk with other people, you realize there, there is other ways. So I enjoy that. So in the oven this goes, let's see what Sean said, 350 for 50 minutes or until golden brown. Doesn't that look good? A butter cake. - [Eddie] Mmmhmm. (Paula laughing) - I like me a butter cake. So Sean. Our dump cake is ready. Oooh we! When you cook in a glass. dish, they're so heavy. I always feel like I'm gonna drop it, like it's going to slip out of my hand. Ooh, it's a bubblin an' a sizzlin. And it's so hot. (chuckles) But do I wanna bite? - [Eddie] I think we. need to scoop some out to see what it looks like. - Yes. - [Theresa] What about. that over ice cream, or ice cream over that? - [Paula] Yeah I was gonna. say, ice cream over that. I think the idea is to let this cool. - [Theresa] When have we ever done that? - [Paula] Yes. Woo! Look, you can see every place that that butter melted did y'all. - [Eddie] Yeah. (Paula and Eddie chuckling) - [Theresa] Was it enough for ya? - [Paula] Yeah. I mean, it could have stood. a little bit more in places but it's good. Cherries and pineapple. It's so hot. I almost can't taste it, but I think it's real good Theresa. - [Theresa] I was gonna say- - You got a tougher mouth than me? - [Theresa] Probably, but I. don't know that I wanna burn it. - [Eddie] Well it smells fabulous. - Doesn't it smell so good? - [Theresa] Maybe if you took a little bit smaller piece Paula. - I know it, princess bites. Paula, princess bites. - I'm going to do it right here. Cause you know, I love the cherry. - Okay. - Like that's a princess bite. - And I love the cake part and all that butter on it. Where you goin? - [Theresa] Oh it's good. - Isn't that good? - [Theresa] I'm a huge cherry fan. - I like cherries too. - [Theresa] Yeah, but when. this cools off just a little scoop of ice cream. - Yes, to put a scoop of ice. cream on this while it's hot. The ice cream would melt, and then you'd have like. a milkshake dump cake. - [Theresa] That is good. I haven't found a. dessert I don't like yet. - Sean thank you so much for sending us Grammy Peg's recipe and just keep her memories alive hon, pass them on to your children.;['postres']
G4iMvI48n3Y.json;[Music] I'm going to show you my son Jamie's favorite birthday cake every time he has a birthday he says mama please make me my coconut cake and this is so easy it's a basic 1 2 3 4 cake the reason it's called a 1 2 3 4 K is because it calls for one cup of butter 2 cups of sugar 3 cups of flour and 4 eggs so there's your 1 2 3 4 so we're going to start by creaming 1 cup of butter we're going to add two cups of sugar and we're going to add four eggs to this but we had one of the time No in the other there goes away all right now we're going to start by adding our self-rising flour and our coconut milk so here we go you and last I'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla and you're ready to load your batter into your cake pans now I like to use a little container with a handle on it like this and I'll start with one cup one cup for your next one and so on and so on until you've got them all filled I'm going to take the spatula and just work the batter out to the edges I'm going to pick them up and drop them and it's going to bring the air from the cake to the surface and you can see the air bubbles coming up and it will just give us a little bit more level catch these are ready to go into 350 degree oven all right those are safely in the oven I'm going to cook them for about 25 minutes but in the other oven I have some it should be about ready and they are you can see that they've started pulling away from the pan which lets me know that they're ready they look just delicious I'm going to show you how to make the most delectable filling for this cake we're going to start with sugar sour cream coconut and a little milk like we're ready to start sacking now so we're just going to flip that out like that thank goodness it came out night and we're going to take our wax paper now and just slip it a little under the edge of our cake and this will help keep our plate clean now we're going to take that cake layer and I like using a wooden spoon I like about this size height for my holes to be really big so it can seep down in there you can use a fork or a toothpick but I found the bigger the hole the better the cake then we're going to take our filling and just spoon it look at it you can see it running down into those holes moistening that layer from top to bottom there we go and on this layer we're going to start with our toothpicks so you'll have to alert your guests to be on the lookout for toothpicks because you don't want your take to look like the Leaning Tower we're going to do the same thing all over again and another layer of filling all right we're ready for a final layer now not a secret to this cake is letting that cake marinate in the refrigerator for three days and hope nobody's going to touch it and you know I was prepared so I have one right here that's been in there just drinking up that filling you can see by this it's not a beauty but we're going to fix that because we're fixing to make a divinity icing that we're going to cover this cake in and you won't believe the transformation it's going to be like putting on our makeup and this is so simple to make we're going to start with egg whites sugar pinch of salt about 1/4 of a teaspoon of cream of tartar plain old water so we're going to beat this for one minute [Music] so that's been about a minute and at this point we're going to use the double boiler method and we're going to fit this bowl on top of rapidly boiling water and I'm going to set my timer for seven minutes and we're going to beat [Music] okay seven minutes is up I heard our timer go off and now I'm just going to add a little bit of vanilla to it and I'm just going to gently stir that in with a spatula and we're going to start by putting some up on the edge and then we're going to bring it slowly bring it down we're going to make sure that frosting goes all the way to the bottom and covers up every crumb of our cake kind of looks like marshmallow heaven alright now we're just going to bring that icing on up to the top there's only one thing left to do and that's to put the coconut on the top kind of just press it in against your cake so when you get through it's a little frosting probably go lick off looks like a big snowball doesn't it this cake is ready so now we're just ever so gently going to slip our wax paper out from underneath that layer and we have a clean plate what a great trick that is you know it's just great having two of everything that means I can taste this one here we go I'm in heaven so Ellie [Music];['postres']
GAt4nEtopno.json;"- I am standing up here. readin' y'all another recipe that's being shared by a friend out there, her name is Debbie Thornton. She has a cookie recipe. that her mother-in-law made for many years and she. passed away last year. I'm sorry to hear about. your all's loss, Debbie. But David goes on to. say it was her husband's favorite cookie and I would. love to share it if you could on your YouTube channel. So thank you Debbie for wantin' to do that and I am so happy to be sharin' it. I was at the drug store last night and was lookin' on the candy aisle and I came up to these orange slices, those little orange candies. And I thought, ""Oh, I love. those, I wanna get some!"" But I said, ""No, you got enough. sweet stuff at the house,"" so I left them. And today (giggles) I'm. making an orange slice cookie. So Debbie, thank you so much for sharing your. mother-in-law's recipe with us. There, how about that. for a book holder, Eddie? I'm gonna start by siftin'... Let's see, it's two cups of. flour, all purpose flour, with a pinch of salt. And I had the salt in this one measurer, a teaspoon of baking soda and. a teaspoon of baking powder. If you don't have a. sifter, things like this work very, very well. And I've got a sifter, but. I think I was just too lazy to look for it, Debbie (giggles). - [Eddie] I think I saw. it in the dishwasher. - What?. - I think I saw it in the dishwasher.. - Think you saw it in the dishwasher (giggles)? Okay so there we go, that was real simple. (utensils clang) So we have one cup of sugar. One cup, let me make sure. I'm telling y'all right, yes, one cup of white sugar,. one cup of brown sugar, and a cup of shortening. Now I love... I don't like digging out solid. shortening out of those cans. I just love it now that. they do it in stick form and this is a butter flavor shortening. So we're just gonna cream. these ingredients together. See, it looks like butter y'all. (mixer revs). Debbie says that the hardest part about this recipe, and I know she ain't lying about that, the hardest part of this. recipe was slicing up these orange candies into small pieces. And she says she sprays,. she learned over the years, to spray her knife with a non-stick spray and she'd have to do. it two or three times. But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna add a little bit of flour. You know when you're making. like oatmeal cookies, I love raisins in 'em. or blueberry muffins, to keep things on kilter,. keep your blueberries or your raisins from. settling to the bottom, you just need to dust. them with a little flour. And see how they've already. separated now because of that because I did that? So I like that. So those are gonna be ready. And now that I have creamed this some, I'm gonna add the two eggs that have been slightly beaten and that's gonna finish. creamin' that butter and sugar really, really well.. (mixer revs) Okay so Debbie says add the orange candies so I think that we do the. rest of this, y'all, by hand. I can't believe I was. craving these orange candies last night and here I am today making 'em. (spoon taps) All right, so we sifted the. flour, the soda, the powder, and the salt together. Now I'm gonna add the sifted ingredients to our wet ingredients. Mm mm. I can't wait to taste this, Debbie. I have never had an orange. slice candy cookie before, I've had an orange slice cake. So now I'm gonna add, let me. see how much we had in coconut, cup of coconut and two cups of oatmeal. It kind of sounds like an oatmeal cookie with a little bit of orange raisin in it. I'm surprised it doesn't. call for nuts, Debbie. But I'm making this just. like you said to make it. And Debbie goes on to say, to. drop this by just spoonfuls, so just depending on how. big you want your cookies. (glass clangs) Takes a little muscle, but almost got it. (glass clangs) Come in with both hands. (glass clangs) There 'ya go (giggles)! As Olivia says, ""There you go!"" (giggles) Hadn't you heard her say that, Eddie? - Yes.. - ""There you go!"" - [Eddie] She's starting to repeat everything you say right now. - Uh uh. She's like a little mockingbird. All right, so I am gonna drop those on a pre-greased cookie sheet and Debbie said to bake 'em. for 10 to 12 minutes or longer. So there again, it depends. on how you like your cookies. If you like them on the. softer side, cook 'em less. If you like them crispy, cook 'em more. 375, pre-heated oven, y'all. Okay, Debbie said to leave. these sittin' on the tray for five minutes before. you transfer them over to a cooling rack so. that's what we're gonna do. Five minutes will fly by. (pans clang) (door slams). There we go! Oh, they look delicious. I don't see the orange candies in them. That looks like maybe. that was one right there, I don't know. Oh, I see a little piece of orange! There's a little piece of orange. I can't wait. I can't wait to taste 'em. It's been almost five minutes hadn't it? I've been thinking about. it for five minutes, but you definitely want to spray your pan. Thank you, Teresa (giggles). - [Teresa] Oh, you wanna... Oh, I'm sorry!. - It fell off my hand. Because they could stick for a little bit, so you wanna spray that pan. Okay, that is the first. pan and I've still got at least this many more to bake off. Who likes warm cookies? Oh! I see that candy!. - I see it! I see it! - I see that candy, Debbie (giggles)! Mm, they are delicious. Would you like the other. half of my cookie, Eddie? - [Teresa] How is it, Eddie? - Good, yeah.. - Delicious. - [Eddie] Taste the orange. - It's delicious. - Do they melt?. - Uh uh. Uh uh. See it stayed in little cubes? - That's one of our questions... Yeah it did, didn't it? One of our questions was. - You're going to think I'm nuts, y'all, I'm not real crazy about. cookies while they're warm, but honey, I'll mow 'em. down once they cool off. How about you Eddie? - [Eddie] Either way. - Either way (giggles)? Michael. I can't stand to see a grown man cry. Come on. Come on. How about a bite? - No, I'm havin'... Look what I'm havin'... (laughs). - He's havin' lettuce. - [Eddie] A lettuce cookie. - And tuna salad (laughs)! If you're not gonna take. it, quit the cryin'. - [Teresa] Exactly, I'm. with you on that one. He's got to go. - I'm thinking the same thing, Teresa. - [Teresa] He's got to go. - He got to go (giggles)! And I got to go (giggles)!";['postres']
GCINpXCZSFw.json;- Hey friends. Do y'all sometimes wish, you know, when company drops in and you offer 'em a cup of coffee maybe or something to drink and you think gosh I wish I had something quick I could run in the kitchen. and stir together for 'em. Well this is one of those recipes y'all. You only have to be a. little bit prepared for it. You wanna start by buying some tart shells, you know whatever tart shell you like we're just using a small one because these are called. strawberry tiramisu bites. And so that's considered a bite and they're good,. they're not overly sweet, and I keep them in the freezer. So at a moment's notice I. can stir something together. So I've got my strawberry preserves, and I'm goin' put just a dollop, a little tiny dollop of the preserves in the bottom of our tart shells. Just like that. You wanna come finish. this Theresa so I can- - [Theresa] Yeah.. - [Chef] Go on to the other- Would you mind doing that for me? - [Theresa] Certainly. - I'm gonna come around this. side and I'll do it on top. - [Chef] Okay, there you go. - [Theresa] You can have this.. - [Chef] Thank you. - [Theresa] And I'll take that. - [Chef] It's easy, it. just takes a minute. - [Theresa] No problem. - And plus I get a lick of. strawberry jelly. (laughs) Actually it's strawberry preserves. All right so over here. I've got some lemonade, lemon juice. So these are gonna be nice and lemony. And then I've got mascarpone. cheese which I do love. You like mascarpone? - [Theresa] Mm hm. - [Chef] Okay so we just. gonna mix those together. Tiramisu is one of Michael. Groover's favorite desserts. And do I make it? No, (laughs) I don't. know why I don't make it. Maybe it's 'cause I like my grandmother. Hires' carrot cake better. Or grandma Paul's sour cream pound cake. - [Theresa] Grandgirl's fresh apple. - [Chef] Oh Grandgirl's fresh apple cake. Oh, holy moly. - [Theresa] Apple secrets. - [Chef] Uh huh. I had more fun when I was. filming Paula's best dishes up north we went to an apple orchard and oh my goodness we were,. it was somewhere near... it was somewhere near Gordon's house. - [Theresa] Mm hm I can't remember where. - You just ride into this orchard and red apples as far as you can see it is one of the most beautiful sites. All right. I'm gonna quit talking and. I'm gonna beat this together. Well, is this been turned off? - [Theresa] Probably yeah, I'm sure- - [Chef] The grandkids were over yesterday and they'll come in and hit every button that they can reach. So we just gonna beat this. together till it's creamy. You wanna start out low because that lemon juice and that. lemonade will fly everywhere if we start out too high. What was that Paula? (laughs) Okay that appears to be nice and creamy and incorporated. - [Theresa] Now this is. gonna make a lot more than... - [Chef] Oh my gosh yes. - [Theresa] But since. it's only the three of us. (both laugh) - [Theresa] And we would sit. here and eat all of them. - [Chef] Every one of 'em. All right, so we're gonna come over here. I'm gonna wash these. off and dry 'em though because we're fixing a. whip, heavy cream with them. And I don't want anything to possibly mess up our whipping cream, getting stiff. And I'm sure you know that. all these little hand mixers there's a right hole and a wrong hole for each beater. And it won't work if you trying' to put. it in the wrong hole. Let's see I'm gonna have to open this so, I've got three quarters. of a cup of heavy cream. (cup clatters) And I'm gonna just beat this. (whisk whirring) Until it forms soft peaks. Lemon extract. Powder and sugar. I'm gon' slowly add the powdered sugar because it's starting to get stiff. And I'm gonna add one. teaspoon of vanilla extract. I didn't quite reach the-. oops that's too much. There, that that should. be a full teaspoon. Thank you Teresa. That helps.. - [Theresa] Clean as we go. - [Chef] I'm telling. you that helps so much. That's nice and stiff. - [Theresa] That's so good. - And I'm gonna beat this. doesn't it smell good? (whisk whirring) I'm gonna beat this one more. time to just make sure it's nice and smooth. Hey Mikey! What you doing? - [Mikey] Cleaning up some garages. - [Chef] Oh oh. Is er Michael out there? - [Mikey] He went to. lunch with Miss Michelle. - [Chef] Oh, that's right he told me he was probably gonna go to the Creek house the. Paula Deen creek house. We have really good salads there and Michael's trying to cut back. So he and Michelle, his daughter, are going to lunch there. I had forgotten about that. Now so we're just gonna. fold in our whipping cream into our mascarpone. And when you fold, you go down and back up until everything's incorporated nicely. - [Theresa] Eddie I wanna be. that dog snoring on the floor. - I know it she snores. y'all, Lulu snorers. And sometimes she snores so. loud she wakes me up at night. Can you hear her snoring? - [Theresa] Yes. I'm thinking I would love to. be taking a nap that hard- oh, I just woke her up. - [Chef] Oh only for a second. (chef laughs) You wanna, will your cord reach Eddie? (chef laughs) She's a sleepy head. - [Theresa] Now she is. - [Chef] Uh huh. She can fall asleep so quick. All right I'm gonna need a spoon, another spoon. I love my (chuckles) someone. gave me this teaspoon. No coffee, no talkie. (chuckles) And I know that feeling. All right. So we're gonna bring these over here and we're gon' put a little dollop on each one of 'em. Like so. (bowl scrapes surface) All right. We're gonna finish 'em off. That one's a little thick. They're all a little thick. I'm gonna... These are almost bigger than the tarts. There we go. If you're doing this for. maybe the fourth of July you could add a blueberry have the strawberries and blueberries. (knife clatters) So there you go. Strawberry tiramisu bites. - [Theresa] Pretty. - Aren't they pretty? Happy whatever we're are. celebrating. (laughs) Hm. Come have one! They're good! And they're quick. Bye y'all.;['postres']

It's the last day that. Catholics can eat something really, really, really fattening because tomorrow is gonna be Lent and they're gonna be giving up things. Now I am married to a Catholic, but I'm a Baptist. So, I may (laughs), but no. matter what religion I am, I should be more well-versed. than what I am, y'all. But that's all right. I'm not well-versed in a lot of things. But so, anyway, I am. gonna share with y'all this recipe for a king cake. So to start off, I've. got an 8-ounce package of cream cheese, and I've got. one cup of dark brown sugar. So, I'm just gonna blend that together. Really good. So, did y'all know that this cake, the king cake, started. back in the medieval days - [Theresa] Middle ages. - In the middle ages.. - Yeah. - Ah, wow, that was a long,. long, long, long time ago. - [Theresa] Do you know why they had to have this kind of cake? - [Paula] No, why? - [Theresa] 'Cause one person. needed to be king for the day. - Oh, (laughs). - [Theresa] So they put a pea in it. - And who decided this? - [Theresa] I'm not sure about that. But they put a pea in it. - [Paula] Yes, back then, and I'll show you what they put in it. Okay, I think that's good enough. - [Theresa] Yeah, I'm already sold. - I know, I'm so hungry. Want it to get all off. I'm still working, woop. (Paula laughing) - [Theresa] I went. somewhere the other day, and it's kind of funny. - I'm still working with them. - [Theresa] It was a bakery and she had her bowl. left from the cookies. And there were still like. a little bit of dough, and I so wanted to say, ""If. you were with Paula Deen, you would not be having that dough."" - She left dough in the bowl. Why?. - Well, not a little dough. But you know what I mean, like how you go all the way. around the edges and get every. - [Theresa] She did not do that. - Alight so, back in medieval days, they made this king cake. But they would put like. a dried pea in there. And Theresa tells me that they did that so that whoever got that. pea would be king for a day. I don't know how, I don't know,. did this include children, or just adults? I don't know. Do you know Theresa? - [Theresa] No, but it sounds like fun. - It does sound like fun. I wanna be king for a day. In fact, I used to love. that show ""Queen for a Day."" In fact, I tried for years,. y'all, to get somebody to produce a show, the. ""Queen for a Day"" show. Oh, I wanted to do it so badly. I said, I would used to. come home from school every afternoon and. watch ""Queen for a Day,"" and I'd squall like a baby. when those women baked. And this is what it was. like back then, y'all, in the '50s. Their gift would be a washing machine or an iron and an ironing board. Something that they. could do more work with. They certainly were not. giving gifts for a queen. I said, ""Work harder, work longer, women."" - [Theresa] But to be honest, back then, those were like, those made life simpler. - Yes, and it was who. had the saddest story. And then I think the audience voted on who was gonna be queen. And they didn't give away. cars and things like that. It was, like I said, a. washing machine, or a dryer, or something like that. But so anyway, I never could get anybody to go along with me. But that's all right. I've enjoyed it in my head. So this is so good. Now to this filling, I'm gonna. add a half a cup of pecans, and a half a cup of raisins. Now if you want your raisins plump, I could have set them in. real, real, real hot water and let 'em plump up. But, I'm eliminating that step. because I kind of like 'em a little on the hard side, you. know, for things like this. So there we go, that's all mixed up and it's delicious, y'all. Okay, so now the cake part. We're making this simple y'all. We, I say ""we."" Theresa went to the grocery store, y'all, and picked up some frozen bread dough. And you just let that thaw. And I'm gonna sprinkle. This is my favorite cutting. board 'cause it's got my pie circles, I love this. This came out years. - [Theresa] I've given this as gifts. - Yes, years ago.. - To people and they love them. - Love it, love it, love it, okay. So. - [Theresa] The bread dough. came in a big pack of like five. - Oh, it did?. - So that's why, I have it, that's why I. have it in a Ziploc bag. 'Cause I didn't need all five. - No. All right, okay. So we got our dough out pretty. close to a 10x18, y'all. And now that wonderful. filling that we made a little while ago, we're gonna put it in here,. and we're gonna spread it within a inch of its sides. Later on, down the way,. in a more Western world, the pea got changed to a baby. And that baby was in there, he represented. our love for our baby Jesus that we had. So, that was why we changed it to a baby at some point in history. - [Theresa] Well, you. know, Paula, I'm Catholic. So.. - Yes, you are Catholic. And you're very staunch. Catholic, aren't you? - [Theresa] I try to be, sometimes. But the thing that we were. taught with the king cake was it was a baby Jesus.. - Yes. - [Theresa] But that it. was done around the time of what we call the Epiphany, which is the 12th day after Christmas, which is January 6th, when the Wise Men found the baby Jesus. - Jesus, yes, because. he was two weeks old, wasn't he, by the time the Wise Men followed the star.. - Right. - To his stable where he was living. - And so that's why they, and then, so they changed it to a baby. To represent Jesus. - All kind of information isn't it? Today. I'm gonna cut that dough off a little bit. I'm gonna cut this one off. All right, and we're. gonna roll this long ways. Just like this. This is gonna be so good, y'all. All right, now what we wanna do now, is now that we can, do you. wanna come around here? - Certainly.. - And take a picture of it this way?. - Eddie does a much better job at cameras, and I realize that, so. - No, you are doing fine. So we just wetting that. edge with a little water. So it will stay sealed. And now we're gonna do. the same thing over here. And we're gonna pinch that together. - Look at that.. - Yes, we don't want that piece 'cause it doesn't. have any filling in it. - We won't tell anybody.. - No. - Just gonna seal it with a little water. Now I'm gonna push some filling in there. - [Theresa] And, Paula, a. lot of what bakers do now. - Now how am I gonna get this. on the cookie sheet (laughs)? I should have put it on. my baking sheet first. Okay, y'all, before I. rolled it into a circle, I should have put it on my. cookie sheet, but I didn't. But I was actually able to just pick it up and transfer it my cookie sheet,. which I've sprayed lightly. And now we're gonna spray our king cake with this spray. And hopefully that'll turn. it a real pretty shiny. - [Theresa] Could you. do an egg-wash on that? - Huh?. - Could you do an egg-wash? - Yeah, you could do an egg wash on this. So this is gonna have to sit for about 45 minutes to an hour in the oven. And what I did, 'cause it's really chilly. It's a little chilly here in. Savannah, so I cut my oven on. And then I cut it off. and hopefully that will, that will be just about. the right temperature. So we're gonna cover. this with plastic wrap. And rise, baby. Like Jesus did on a Easter Sunday, rise. Okay. I have no idea what the, it's nice and warm in. there, nice and warm. I can't remember the. temperature of what they say for a warm spot when you're rising, trying to rise dough. It's something I'll have to. look up, y'all, I'm sorry. I don't have that information. on the top of my head. - [Theresa] We can put. that in the, we can add. - I don't know if it's 85. Yeah, I can't, I just can't remember. But anyway, that's got to do its magic. - [Theresa] And we'll be back. - For the next 45 minutes. Yes, and then the fun part comes in. 'Cause we gonna color. and do all kind of stuff. And you'll notice that I did. not put a baby in the center because I really don't like. the idea of baking plastic. So when we take it out of the oven, I'll cut a little slit and. stick that baby somewhere in that cake, and whoever gets. that piece is gonna be a king or a queen for a day, right? - [Theresa] Eddie and I. will be fighting over it. - You can be a queen too. Not just the king, right? - [Theresa] Yeah. - Our king cake looks great, y'all. And remember, I had it in an. oven that had been warmed, and then I cut it off. So it rose really, really. nice, didn't it, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes, it smells so good. - Yes, smells like yeast rolls, so good. There's nothing better. So now we're gonna put. this in the oven, y'all. We're gonna bake it for. 35 to 45 minutes at 350, I believe it is. Is that right, Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Okay, so I'm putting it in the top rack, which is like the middle,. the middle of the oven. So I think I'm gonna set. the timer for you, Theresa. - Okay.. - Because I am fixing to leave to go to Jack's final. play-off basketball game. Because tonight the winner is the champ. It's the city champ. So again, he's real excited about that. So I'm gonna run to his basketball. game while that's baking. And then we'll finish it. up right after I get back. Okay, look at our king cake,. y'all, it turned out so good. Uh-oh, I left a baby over. here, I got a baby here, I got a baby there. Now I'm gonna just, I. made me a little slit, and I'm gonna stick that. baby in right there. Let me see if I can, there we go. And hopefully the frosting. will cover that up. But I know that that baby is. where I, where my seam is. Okie-dokie, all right. Now we're gonna make the icing. And let me give you all. the correct measurements, a cup and a half a confectioners' sugar, and three tablespoons of milk, and one teaspoon of butter. or vanilla flavoring. So I'm gonna go ahead and get, uh-oh. I'm gonna go on and get our teaspoon of vanilla flavoring in. All right, so I'm gonna measure out three tablespoons of milk. Okay, now we're gonna. need to whip up our icing. And the recipe says if you. need more milk, just add it. Now we've let our king cake. completely cool, y'all. So if we'd put it on. there while it was hot, it would have slipped, it. would have melted all off. So we don't want that to happen. (electronic beeping) And y'all's papa's home, y'all's papa's home. Okay, so I just wanna. make sure I pull the lumps out of there. So I think that looks pretty, pretty good. My milk spoon. And I'm gonna come over here. And I'm gonna start icing. And let it run down the sides. Okay, so we wanna quickly do this because remember the colors of Mardi Gras. Let's see, it's. Golly bum. One is for reverence, one. color is for, gosh, Eddie, do you remember? - [Eddie] No, I was doing the. giveaway when you and Theresa were going over all that. - Were talking about all that. Gosh, now I can't remember. But you can look it up. - [Eddie] The three colors represent. - [Paula] Yeah, what the. three colors represent. I'm thinking one of them was reverence. I'll get every bit of this. stuff out of here, y'all. All right, so here we go. - [Michael] Green, gold, and. purple, representing faith, power, and justice.. - That's it. That's it, y'all. Faith, power, and justice. So here's a little power. - Think that was faith.. - Okay, what's the purple? - Purple is justice.. - Justice. Okay, we're gonna get. some justice in here. Well, hey, Lulu, you. left her outside, Papa. Alright, now here's some purple, oh, I love that purple color. Don't y'all like the purple? I think the green, we. just need some more green. Okay, and what's the yellow for? - Power.. - Power, okie doke. And if you find the baby, Papa, you get to be the king for the day. - [Michael] I had it last year. and I didn't get anything. - Yeah, yeah.. - You got to be king. - [Eddie] You don't remember being king? - [Michael] No. - [Paula] Well, that's too bad. All right.. - That's perfect for my diet. - I know it is perfect your diet. I love the purple color. All right, now I'm gonna try to scoop some of this icing up. I think I would like to. make a little bit more icing next time (laughs). - Imagine that.. - 'Cause y'all know I'm a condiment girl. Okay, can y'all see where. it needs anything else? I think it's beautiful. What do y'all think? Do you think that's beautiful? - [Michael] Yes. - And there's a baby in there. And if you find it, people. - [Micheal] I'm not gonna eat. any of it, so if I find it, I gotta just get a knife and fork. - All right, well, I'm gonna taste it. - [Micheal] Watch you get the baby first. - I know where I put the baby. - [Micheal] That's not fair. - I tell y'all, using. that frozen bread dough that you get from the grocery. store, that is the ticket. Because it made it so simple. Look at our king cake. It's so good, people. You wanna taste it? - No.. - No? - You won't taste it?. - No. - When he, when he diets, he does not cheat. He does not cheat, not one time. You sure you don't want a bite? - I'm not eating.. - He ain't eating it. - That's all right, then. there's more for me and Eddie. Hey look, that's a great way. to get that icing outta there. Mm-mm-mm. You better eat it before Lent. - [Micheal] Y'all should. be bouncing me around. - 'Cause you know, Michael,. you eat this on ""Fat Tuesday,"" 'cause the next day is Lent. So you can't have any when Lent gets here. - [Micheal] I know. - But on ""Fat Tuesday,"" let's eat up. I love them best dishes, y'all. And when this airs, it's gonna be your last. day to be able to, well, it depends on what you're. giving up for Lent. You may be giving up just milkshakes. Right? Love them best dishes, y'all.";['postres']
GURLspJCSbA.json;"- Hey buddies, come on in the kitchen and I want to thank y'all. for being my sunshine today. It's actually kind of cloudy out. Well now the sun shining out, ain't it? But y'all are my sunshine. and I thank you so much. Ain't that a pretty yellow. that just makes you smile just looking at it. Well, I've got another recipe from a friend that I've never met. Hopefully one day I'll get to meet her. Her name is Sherry Kilgore and she said, ""Dear Paula, there aren't. many positive things that were a result of the. pandemic, but you sure were."" Thank you so much, Sherry. She said, ""I look forward to watching. your show every day. I love watching you cook with your pets and you run around barefoot and talking to Eddie and Teresa."" Yeah. What you see is what you get Sherry. So anyway, Sherry has this recipe and she received it. from her aunt Charlene. And she said, ""It's one of the easiest. recipes I've ever made."" And this sounds so simple, y'all. But at the same time, it sounds decadent. And it's called Chocolate Treasures. And this is the Story Moaning Glory. We got a half a stick of butter. So I'm just going to. cut that right in half and put it in our pot. And then we're going to add. one canyon of Eagle Brand milk. Now, you know Eagle Brand milk and butter. This thing has got to be good. Cause this stuff you could eat. straight out of the canyon. It's so delicious, ain't it? (giggles) I'm making sure we get every. drop out, y'all. Every drop. The triplets y'all, are on vacation. They are with the other. set of grandparents. They're celebrating their. grandmother, Maria Otika. Her 60th birthday. And the children are getting. to meet their cousins for the first time. And the cousins on Claudia's. brother's side, Juan. He has such a beautiful family. They have two sets of twins. and the oldest set eight and then they got a set. of five-year-old twins and then Claud and Bobby. with their triplets. And I know their grand. mama and grand daddy is in hog heaven. It's the first time that. both of their children and all their grandchildren. have been together. So it's a good thing near down there because I think I would be so tempted to split these kids one. of your cookie, Sherry. They sounds so good. All right. So we've got. a half a stick of butter, a can of sweetened condensed meal and now they used to make 12 ounce bags, but now they're 11.5 and. that's milk chocolate. And we're going to put it. over here on this stove. Let's see what Sherry's says. ""In a 3-quart sauce pan, melt the butter, Eagle Brand and chocolate chips."" And she tells us, ""Do not. boil."" You know, just melt it. So that's what we're gonna do. And she said, ""When melted, remove from. heat and add the vanilla and then the flour, and finally the Pecans and just stir well till blended. And then you drop it on parchment paper and bake it for about 10. minutes on 350 degrees."" I cannot wait to taste. this chocolate cookie. Sounds like it is truly a treasure. So we've got the stove on. back there and we getting. Oh, look how nice at room. temperature this butter is. So got it going back there. So we're going to need. to go back here and stir. And make sure it does not boil. So I'm going to take. all my stuff back here. You know that some good stuff.. Yes sorry, baby. (giggles) So here's the ingredients. It's a half a stick of butter,. one can of Eagle Brand, 12 ounce package of milk chocolate chips, one cup of flour, one teaspoon of vanilla and two cups of coarsely chopped pecans. Okey-dockey, it's totally. melted and not boiling. Now we're going to add. like a teaspoon of vanilla. We're going to stir in the flour. And that was one cup of All Purpose. I can't imagine a cookie. being this easy to make. Just sounds kind of crazy, doesn't it. I don't know how to act not having to pull out a big old mixer. Okay. This looks like a chocolate. icing, doesn't it, Eddie? - [Eddie] Mh hmm. Yeah.. I was thinking brownies. - Oh. (laughs) All right. Now we've got to add two. cups of chopped nuts. Now Sherry, you did not tell me how big of spoonfuls to make these. You just said, ""Drop on parchment paper."" So, I want to get those nuts. stirred in there really good. Wow. (giggles) Ooh. I just love the way those look. All right. I'm gonna, just in case. She doesn't say whether. to spray it or not. But I'm gonna spray it. just cause I got the spray. So, I'm gonna drop it like that big. I'm taking off this paper just kills me. Come on, now. Stick. Okay so, doesn't that look about the size that was talked about, Eddie? All right. In the oven. 10 minutes. And we'll see what Sherry's. been cooking all these years. Love the fact that all. the nuts is in it, y'all. I have to just say this, y'all. You must, must try this recipe.. You must make it. Cause-- - [Woman] You need to break down and tell him that he couldn't. even wait for the film to go before you had. already eaten a cookie. - Yes, yes. One cookie missing, now there's two cookies missing. This is incredible. Gottlieb's bakery, an old, old family here in Savannah. Gottlieb's bakery.

A. wonderful, wonderful cookie. Well, they have since closed, but they wouldn't be as. good so many years here. This is a chocolate chewy. How? How? How, how, how. can I ever thank you for sharing this recipe with us? I have made these before. That was supposed to be. like the Chocolate Chewy, but it was more detailed than this. I've never made a cookie. that tastes that delicious that was that easy to make. - [Teresa] 15 Minutes. That's. from making it in the-- - Yes. And it makes. And I. said, I didn't know how much to dip it, but I did like a tablespoon. And you know, just kind of. did it like that. (laughs) Just like that, y'all. (laughs) Hold on one second. Yeah.

gwSOwAe_IVY.json;(upbeat music) - Hey, everybody. It's Natasha of NatashasKitchen.com, and today, I have such a treat for you. I'm gonna teach you how to. make our family favorite, chicken Parmesan. It sounds fancy, but it. is ridiculously easy. It has simple ingredients, and it is just the juiciest chicken, restaurant-quality, and. perfect for a busy weeknight. And, if you want to save even more time, you can use a store-bought marinara sauce, but homemade is ridiculously simple, and you can't match the flavor. So let's do this. We're gonna do a quick. prep of our ingredients. Start out by chopping. half of a medium onion. You should have about half a cup chopped. Set that aside. Also mince three large garlic cloves. And seriously, if you don't. have one of these already, a food scraper makes. prep work so much easier. I'll link to my favorite one in the notes. Now place a saucepan over medium heat and add two tablespoons of olive oil. Then add the finely chopped onion and stir that for about five minutes or until it's softened and lightly golden. Add your minced garlic and. stir for another minute or until fragrant. Now add a 28-ounce can. of crushed tomatoes, and get the best-quality. one that you can find. I will link to the one. we used in the notes. Add half a teaspoon of dried oregano, half a teaspoon of sea salt, and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper. Bring that mixture to a light boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook partially covered for 15 minutes. While that sauce is simmering, you can get started on. your chicken Parmesan. You'll need two large chicken breasts, totaling about one and a half pounds. Cut those in half lengthwise. to get four even cutlets. If your cutlets are uneven or very large, you can pound them between. two sheets of plastic wrap for an even thickness. This way, they'll cook much more evenly. Lightly season both sides of your cutlets with salt and pepper. Now we're gonna set up a. simple breading station. In the first shallow bowl, combine one half cup of all-purpose flour, one teaspoon of sea salt, and half a teaspoon of black pepper. Stir that mixture. together just to combine, and in the second shallow bowl, beat together two large eggs until frothy. In a third shallow bowl, combine one half cup of breadcrumbs, I'm using Italian. breadcrumbs for more flavor, and one half cup of Parmesan. cheese that's been shredded. And if your Parmesan. cheese is larger pieces, break them up with your fingertips as you mix that mixture together. Now it's time to bread. the chicken cutlets. Dip the first one into the flour mixture and tap off the excess. Then transfer it to the beaten eggs. Turn that to get an even coating, and let the excess drip back into the pan. Lastly, dip the cutlets. into the cheesy breadcrumbs, pressing the cutlets into the breading to ensure a thick even coating of crumbs and making sure you bread both sides. Transfer that to a platter, and finish breading the remaining cutlets. Once all of the chicken is prepared, we're gonna head back to the stove. Our homemade marinara. sauce has been simmering for about 15 minutes. Stir in one tablespoon. of fresh chopped basil. Then turn off the heat. The marinara sauce is ready. To cook the chicken,. place a large nonstick pan over medium heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom of the. pan or about two tablespoons. We use a light olive oil because it has a high smoke point and it is great sauteing and baking, but you can use any. high-heat cooking oil here. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and saute three to four minutes per side, depending on the. thickness of your cutlets, or until the chicken is. golden-brown on the outside and the internal temperature. reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit on an instant-read thermometer. As soon as it's cooked through, take the chicken off the heat. If you haven't already, preheat your oven to. 425 degrees Fahrenheit. We're gonna finish off this. chicken Parmesan in the oven. So in a nine-by-13 casserole dish, spread half of your marinara. sauce over the bottom. Place your sauteed chicken in. a single layer over the sauce. My cutlets were quite large, so they were overlapping. slightly, but that's okay. Spoon the remaining sauce generously over the center of each chicken cutlet. The marinara will help seal in. the juiciness of the chicken and adds incredible flavor. And, last but not least, top with a generous one cup. of shredded mozzarella cheese. Bake that uncovered on the center rack of a preheated oven at 425. degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted. and the sauce is bubbling. Ho ho ho! Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Oh, I am so excited for this. And I love to serve chicken. Parmesan with some pasta, so I've got that cooked. already, some buttered noodles. And when it comes out of the oven, I love to garnish it with a. little bit of fresh parsley and some fresh basil. You can use one or other,. but I happen to have both, so I'm just using both. It just makes it so pretty, and then it draws out that basil flavor from the marinara sauce. Mm. Okay, here we go. The taste test. All right, serving this with. some hot buttered spaghetti. Yum. Still steamy. I'm so excited. I'm so hungry too. Okay, here we go. And because this has marinara,. it's so delicious over pasta, so I'm gonna spoon on some sauce first. And there's plenty in there,. so you can be generous. Okay. All right, here we go. I love how the cheese gets. crisp and so good on the edges. Yum, yum, yum. Oh, wow. Look at that cheese pull. I'm a sucker for cheese. Yum. Okay. Just a smidge more parsley. And we're gonna cut right. in, because I want you to see exactly how juicy this chicken is. Oh, that Parmesan crust just seals in all the natural chicken. juices and flavors. Here we go. Oh. Look inside. Look at that chicken. It looks amazing. Okay, here we go for the taste test. Actually, that's a. really big bite, too big. What was I thinking? I'm gonna cut that down just a bit, so I can fit it in my mouth,. because that's ridiculous. Okay, here we go. Mm. Mm. Mm. Wow. And that homemade marinara is. just as good as the chicken. Over some spaghetti. Let's get some spaghetti up in here. Mm. And how do you like your spaghetti? Do you use a spoon and twirl. it on or just use the bowl? As long as it gets in my mouth. Mm. This is the perfect simple dinner. It's classy and elegant, but it really has simple ingredients. This is totally a restaurant-quality dish that you recreate at home,. and my kids love this. They get really excited when I make it because first of all, chicken. Everybody loves chicken and cheese. And it's just like bubbly and cheesy when it comes out of the oven. They cannot resist this dish. It is on the regular rotation. I hope it becomes a favorite for you. Speaking of taste testers, here they come. Oh. All right. Everybody's hungry. Here we go. - Both mine. - Mm. - Hey, leave some for me. - Okay. - No, duh, duh, duh. What do you think? You love it? Woo-hoo! - Yummy, yummy. Very, very, very, very, very, very great. - Very great. That's so cute. Thanks, honey. That's a wrap.;['segundos']

memorable first I'm gonna be making a sinful raspberry sherry trifle with layers of fruit custard and cream next I'm gonna have a twist on a traditional Eclair and this ain't your grandma's recipe this isn't a Claire cake and just in case that's not rich enough I'm gonna be making a peanut butter and cheese fudge this guaranteed to hit the spot so get ready everybody to indulge because there's about to be a sugary buffet coming y'all's way you you know some days it's hard for me to believe that I'm working well today is one of those days because guess what today's show is it's sweet endings that's right everything I'm making today is sweet but in order to get to those sweet endings we got to have a beginning so why don't we start today with probably one of my favorite trifles it's a raspberry sherry trifle now for our trifle I've started by baking off a yellow butter cake mix just an ordinary box cake mix that you get at your grocery store and it should be ready I've baked it in a 13 by 9 by 2 pan and I'm gonna pull it out and let it cool while we're making our custard this smells really really good the cake has moved away from the side of the pan and that lets me know that the cake is done so we're just gonna leave that sitting right here let it cool and I'm gonna step over to the stove and I'm gonna start the custard fire raspberry trifle I've got me a glass bowl and I've placed it over hot water now it's important that you don't let the water touch the bottom of your bowl now I'm just gonna bring that up to a bowl I've got seven egg yolks in my bowl into that I'm gonna add 3/4 of a cup of sugar okay I'm just gonna beat that up and to this I'm gonna add one cup of sherry now it's very important that you don't use a cooking sherry if it's not good enough for you to pour into a glass and drink then don't put it in your food now I'm just gonna mix these up and we're gonna cook it for about eight minutes over the boiling water until it kind of looks like mayonnaise so what are we gonna do five minutes show how about if we chat I want to show you on something that came in the mail today this very day it came in the mail today take a look over here to my right would you believe it's a Paula Deen doll a girl said that to me today and let's see certificate of authenticity this doll is from woodland face angel doll collection and Paula Deen has received a full facial repaint which I needed so bad I appreciate that one this doll is an original design by the artist Gail Jaber otherwise known as Gabby Gabby thanks so much I couldn't believe it all right now that's been whisked up real real well and in the meantime I've already got a batch of the cream made that's been putting the refrigerating cooled so it's ready for us to put together and you can see the consistency of it all right now I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna take two cups of heavy cream and I'm gonna add two tablespoons of powdered sugar now I'm gonna beat this until it forms stiff peaks now if you want to ensure yourself that your whipping cream turns out perfectly you'll want to use a chilled fold and you want to chill your beaters all right so I'm gonna sit that to the side for a second and bring in our cold custard now I'm gonna take about half of our heavy cream and I'm gonna fold it in to our custard and when I say fold that means you'll want to take your spatula go down and over and that whipping cream is gonna make your custard light all right now I'm gonna come over here and get our cake bring it over here and you can just cut this or tear it into small kind of 1-inch pieces and you can see that the bowl I'm selected for my trifle is a glass bowl cuz it's just real neat looking kind of shows it off really really good all right so we're gonna do 1/3 of the cake and then I'm gonna come up here because the next step is gonna be on raspberries and I'm using 310 ounce boxes of frozen raspberries set up and thawed if you don't like raspberries you can always use blueberries or strawberries right now I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna put a layer of custard why don't y'all go get you something to drink while I finish putting our trifle together and when we come back I'm gonna be making Eclair cake that's really really delicious and then even later on I'm gonna take three three ingredients that are probably some of my favorites and I'm gonna combine them all into one kick-butt dessert so I'll see y'all back in a few minutes [Music] hey while y'all were gone I finished getting a trifle together look how beautiful it looks look at that y'all I got a little bit of raspberry mmm that's so delicious if you're a raspberry fan this is gonna be right up there among your favorites it's truly delicious and guess what I'm making next y'all I'm gonna be making Eclair cake now I've gotten my casserole dish buttered and I'm gonna line it with graham crackers and you just do this any way you can if they overlap you know it's alright just however you need to get the job done all right now we've got our crust ready and that was very very simple wanting it kind of crust I like now we're gonna come over to this bowl and I'm gonna take instant french vanilla pudding and I'm gonna mix that with three and a half cups of milk all right I'm gonna beat this for about two two-and-a-half minutes now for some reason you don't like instant puddings you can get the cooked type pudding and just need to let that cool low before you put it together all right that looks great now I'm gonna take a small container of frozen whipped topping that's been thawed and I'm gonna take this and fold it in and you don't have to be extremely careful with this because that whipped toppings not gonna break really about the only way it would break is if you hadn't thought it well and you tried to stir it it would just it would just deflate on you just down to nothing now that's the custard part of our Eclair we've got our crust we've got our custard and if you'll move on down here with me we're going to make the chocolate part of our Claire so I've got my confectioner sugar and that's one and a half cups and then I've got a half a cup of unsweetened cocoa and I'm just going to stir those two ingredients together and then I'm gonna run them through my little strainer just to make sure that I get all the lumps out of them today is such a beautiful day it's been so windy here the last couple of days so I'm really glad to see that the winds died down and the Sun is out all right now I've got our cocoa and our powdered sugar mixed together now I'm going to take three tablespoons of room-temperature butter and I'm gonna cut into our dry ingredients now I'm going to add a couple of teaspoons of a white corn syrup all right that felt about like two teaspoons and now I'm gonna add two teaspoons of vanilla flavoring I'm just gonna mix that up I think I'm gonna use like a third of a cup of milk and if it still too thick for you then just add a little bit more milk oh it's looking good don't you just love it when you can find a 10-minute dessert like this that you can whip together at the last minute all right now we're gonna come back over here and we're gonna put a layer of our custard over our first layer of graham crackers and I'm gonna kind of gently just spread it over those crackers all right now we're gonna make another layer using our graham crackers all right now we're gonna come back with the rest of our cream filling over that second layer of graham crackers this kind of reminds me a little bit these steps right here kind of remind me a little bit of nacho Mama's banana pudding we're gonna spread that out again all right now one more layer of crust all right now we're gonna grab our chocolate filling that we just mixed up and you can see the consistency of our chocolate and then we're just gonna drizzle it which is come true easily over those graham crackers now this is gonna tighten up some y'all because we're gonna put this in the refrigerator and let it chill so you can see now why this is called an eclair cake you know this is truly like a five or ten minute dessert I think the family will love it especially chocolate lovers and it'll be a lot easier than getting in there and making your traditional eclairs so I'm gonna cover this and put it in the refrigerator and when we come back one of my desserts that contain like three of my favorite foods so I want you to come back with me and let me share this recipe with you and then after that why do things go wrong well I'm gonna see if I can help you fix it I'll see y'all back a couple of minutes I told y'all about my three favorite ingredients well here they are it's butter cheese and peanut butter now I know y'all are thinking Paulo what are you fixing to do next well I'm fixing to make us a quick delicious peanut butter cheesy fudge and you're not gonna believe how quick this is gonna come together and I'm gonna melt a half a pound of processed cheese and give that a little head start because that takes longer to melt than our butter does so I'm just gonna give that a little head start all right now I'm gonna go ahead and add the butter and I'm just gonna stir this and this is probably the longest step to making this peanut butter fudge is melting that cheese now I have to tell you that I want to talk about the recipe a minute and tell you where it came from a friend of mine sent this to me quite a few years ago this recipe for cheese fudge and I just couldn't believe it when I made it that it was so wonderful so I made it with the cocoa and the nuts and I said you know this would really be good use this basic same recipe except leave out the cocoa and add peanut butter and make peanut butter fudge while I tried it and it was perfectly delicious and the cheese and the butter has finally melted now I'm gonna take it off the heat and I'm gonna pour this over to one pound boxes of confectioner's sugar but before I do that I'm gonna throw in this peanut butter so that won't take that but a second to melt down now I'm gonna pour our butter and our cheese and our peanut butter into a powdered sugar and I'm gonna add a cup of nuts now I'm gonna be adding chopped pecans but if you wanted to because you're using peanut butter you could add chopped peanuts and that would be real good also and I'm gonna toss in 1 teaspoon of vanilla and this is kind of a messy job but really there's a reward at the end cuz you get to lick your fingers because about the only way to really get this mixed together real real good is to get in there with your hands and I think I'm just about to that point and in we go and you can see how stiff this is but the heat from my hands just breaks down that confectionery sugar very very quickly cuz you see if I would kept trying to stir that in it would have taken so much longer all right I'm gonna take an 8x8 pan and I'm gonna give it a spray because I want this I got a lot of butter in there but I still want to make sure that when I go to cut my fudge that it comes out nice and easy so I'm just gonna transfer that to my dish and press it and if you find when you get through patting it out that you feel like there's too much butter although I've never heard of such a thing you may think it is so you can just take a paper towel and blot the top of your candy just like that all right I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator and it's not gonna have to sit hardly any time before I can cut it and when I come back I'm gonna be tasting all these things because y'all don't know and I don't know if I've made them right do we its I gotta taste them and also I'm gonna help you out with some solutions the problems that you may have in the kitchen you you know I don't think there's anything more aggravating than being in the middle of a recipe only to find that you're missing an ingredient so I hope a few of these substitutes that I have for you today will help you out when you're in a crunch say for instance a recipe calls for two tablespoons of flour you don't have flour well not to worry you can substitute that with one tablespoon of cornstarch all right you've pulled out that cake mixture all ready to go only to find you don't have all in eggs don't worry about that either because one cup of yogurt is the perfect substitute for your oil in your eggs I'm forever running out of milk so to get that one cup of milk all I have to do is take 1/2 a cup of evaporated milk add a half a cup of water to it and I've got 1 cup of whole milk like I said I hope these will help you out when you've got an emergency what a perfect setting for some sweet endings I swear to Pete I have had the best time today and you know what out of all the desserts I've made today I don't know which I like the best the raspberry and sherry trifle or the Eclair cake or this peanut butter fudge I I really don't know you know I've got a a great diversified tastes for all palates for the chocolate lover [Music] that tastes so much like an eclair in the trifle if you like raspberries you're gonna love this dish but you know Cody I think that maybe the peanut butter fudge maybe my favorite tell me what you think [Music] what's good thanks buddy good mood I hope y'all will use these recipes and love them as much as my family does so until next time y'all the dogs and I would love to send you love and best dishes from our sweet endings to yours;['postres']
HJYR89URWFA.json;- It's the 12 days of. Christmas cookies, y'all. We're almost there. Eddie is not filming with us today. He's gonna start decorating for Christmas and I can't wait to see it. So he's decorating, I'm making cookies, and Teresa's filming. Aunt Peggy is on her way. My sister-in-law, Sandy Neville, has gone to Albany to pick her up. So we are so excited. Right, Lulu? Are we excited? Yes. She said yes. We're so excited, y'all. So I wanna share this recipe with y'all. Now, I shared a gooey butter cake cookie with y'all a while back, but. the other day for Christmas I just wanted to do. something a little different. So I said, candy canes,. what can we do with that? So- (hands clapping) Peppermint cookies. So I'm using the gooey. butter cake cookie recipe to make our peppermint cookies. And so last week or week before last, Teresa, we were playing around and the recipe that I. had concocted last week didn't work so good. I wanted to make 'em into candy canes, you know, rolling out. (host whining) I'll use those store. peppermint candy canes. So, anyway, the family just. flipped over these cookies so I wanna share it with y'all. We are gonna start what, LuLu? She wants something Eddie, doesn't she? I'm gonna start with an eight. ounce package of cream cheese. You know, this is the ingredients we use to make our goey butter cakes. Yeah, I thought, gosh, I don't remember what I did last week. You know, I'll just do things on the fly and then forget or get. confused (laughing). I know y'all find that. hard to believe, don't you? All right, I'm gonna. add one stick of butter. So the gooey butter cake cookies, a little butter right there (laughing). The gooey butter cake cookies don't have but one stick of butter in 'em. Where our goey butter. cakes have two sticks. So we're gonna cream this up real good. (mixer whipping) Now we're gonna add our egg. One egg. Our goey butter cakes actually. have three eggs in those. So little less egg, a little less butter. All right. Now, I'm gonna put in. our peppermint extract. It smells so good and I can't remember what. I did the other day, y'all. Do you remember, Teresa? - [Teresa] A teaspoon. - No, I'm gonna do a. tablespoon (laughing). - [Teresa] Why do you ask? - Because I don't know. But we want these nice. and pepperminty, you know, and I may just put a dollop. of vanilla flavoring in. You know, just gotta have. vanilla in something. Mm-mm-mm. All right, so now we're gonna add, y'all, this is the easiest cookie ever. Now, we're gonna add a cake mix and I'm using just a white. cake mix rather than a yellow because being peppermint. cookies, you know, I want 'em kind of white. And use any kind you want. Any brand will work. All right. So we're just gonna mix that up good. I was over there beating the. hell out of it (laughing). Thing is they didn't want beat. So I thought, you know,. let me bring them over here and just do 'em in the, got a few stragglers that. didn't wanna beat up. But these, when you bake these cookies, these somehow get around. the edge of that cookie and get so crisp. It's like chewy candy. You know, when you, it's good. - All right, so here we go. I don't have any idea how much. peppermint that we crushed. - [Teresa] We did one bag. of the starlight mint. - Okay, well let me,. let's measure it so we can kind of give people an idea. Whoa, nice little heaping cup (laughing). There we go. I'm gonna stir that in there. Okay, now I'm gonna stick this. in the refrigerator, y'all. And love that crunch. of the candy in there. Look at those. I mean, those are just. pure egg right there. Those will make it turn a little pink. Okay. I'm gonna stick this in the. refrigerator and chill it because we're gonna wanna roll it in balls and then roll it in powdered sugar and bake 'em for just a few minutes. So these are the peppermint cookies that I'm getting ready to finish, y'all. And I'm just rolling them in a ball and rolling them in powdered sugar. And now I think I'm gonna. press 'em down like that because I found that I do. like this on the thin side. Okay, y'all, there's a. couple of cookies missing. Jamie Dean said, Mama,. I'm getting two cookies and you can put 'em back in the oven. So that's what I did because. I kinda like mine crispy. And I also like to add some. confectioner sugar, you know, after I take 'em out. Please be careful because. that peppermint when it melts, it's like a hot syrup, and Jamie burned his. hands trying to hurry. So I think I cooked these. about 14 minutes, y'all, and I got another pan ready to come out. Okay, y'all. So I can't remember if I mashed these down before I put 'em in the oven. or I just left them in a ball. These were all left in a ball. Half of these I mashed down. So it really doesn't too much matter unless you like a thinner cookie. Once you get 'em ball. rolled in the powdered sugar put on your cookie sheet. and you can just mash 'em. Just mash 'em down, and that will give you maybe. a little bit thinner cookie. Michael likes his thin and crispy. Now, see that's my favorite. part when that candy's on the edge and it gets real crisp. All right, so I wanna put. these on a cookie sheet. I meant on a wire rack to cool. Oh, gosh, it's so good. So, so good. And they're actually very. easy, aren't they, Teresa? - [Teresa] Very. - Now I just, after they. come out of the oven, I sprinkle 'em with a little. bit more powdered sugar because I just like it. (Teresa laughing) I just like it. It's not necessary if you don't want to but to me it makes a. more holiday that look. See, see right there. where that piece of candy was on the edge and it melted and look it's in a shape of a heart. (paper crackling) And don't even think. about making these, y'all, without parchment paper. If you don't have any parchment paper, don't think about it. Yum. Okay, Teres. You wanna taste one for 'em? I wanna take a- Oh, yes. You want me to taste it for 'em? - [Teresa] Yeah, they wanna see you. - Honey, I am just happy to. Let me find a little one. Look, that piece of. little candy on the edge. That's so good. And here's the funny thing, I'm not crazy about peppermint, y'all, but Jamie got a little of the peppermint on his fingers a while ago. He said, darn. I think I like melted peppermint. You won't be sorry you made these. Merry Christmas, Number 11 (laughing).;['postres']
hPIKgCjjDe8.json;- What goes good with a Thanksgiving meal to finish up the feast? Well, down here we showed. you love pecan pies and we sure do love chocolate. So that's what I'm gonna. share with y'all today. My chocolate pecan pie, and I had to go to my website to get it, 'cause I can't remember. which book it's in, so I've got it right here. And there was 66 reviews. on this pie, right Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - Every one of 'em was five star, everyone of 'em was five star. So if you like me, if you're a chocolate. girl or a pecan girl, try this pie 'cause it's wonderful. All right, now let's. talk about chopped pecans versus whole halves pecans. I have to be totally honest. in the fact that choppy pecans are, it's easier to cut your pie, but I think the halves look. so pretty, don't you Tori? - [Tori] That's a hard one. - Yeah, so I'm gonna. go with the whole half because I sure do want this to look pretty and let's see, it calls for one. nine inch unbaked pie crust, and you can make your. own crust, but you know, let's make it easy on ourselves 'cause we got so much other things to do. And two cups of pecan halves. Now is that two cups, Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - Or more? - [Theresa] No, it's right,. it should be two cups. - 'Cause it's full. It is slack-a-dap full. I love a nut. Especially pecans. They're so good. All right. So I'm gonna add my melted butter. Excuse me. I'm gonna add my melted butter. and my three beaten eggs. And beat that up a little bit more. And don't worry this is safe. for the children to eat, but I'm pouring in two tablespoons of a high quality, good Bourbon. And of course y'all know that. the alcohol cooks out of it. So it's safe. And one cup of sugar. It's gone be a fat pie. I do love a fat pie. Baked by the fat little cook. (chuckles) - [Eddie] You know, I. always find pecan pies intimidating to cook because-- - Do you? - [Eddie] Well, you keep looking at it when it's cooking and it's like, it's not ready, it's not ready. It's like, it's never. looking ready when it-- - This is the easiest. pie, Eddie, of all pies. - [Eddie] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - This is the easiest one. All right, I'm gone go ahead and add, let's see, a half a cup of dark corn syrup and you know, these are in your. grocery store and they are, they come in a white,. a clear, a clear syrup, which is what I use. making my Mama's Divinity and then the dark syrup for. making pies and other things. All right, the last thing I'm. going to put in here y'all is my chocolate chips, whoa. And that's about a third of a cup it calls for three ounces. So, like I said, I'm using third of a cup. It calls for a third of a cup. Three ounces, it calls for three ounces of chopped chocolate chips, but we're using the miniature. so we don't have to chop. All right, so here we go. So, so easy. Mh-hm. (chuckles) told y'all it's gone be a fat pie, fatty, fatty, to by four. (chuckles) Can't get through the. oven door. (chuckles) All right, I'm just. kinda moving that around. So, all the liquid gets down in there and I'm gone try, easy, you see, I almost always buy a. nine inch deep pie crust. (indistinct) Yeah, usually that's what I do. - [Theresa] Just safer? - Just to be safe, but oh. (water running) Like I said, this is just a fat pie. I don't know what else to say about it. Fat girl's gone put her fat. pie in her fat little oven. Now I'm gone bake this y'all at 375. We've got the oven preheated at that. We're gonna cook it at 375 for 10 minutes. Then we're gone turn the oven down to 350 and we're gonna continue to cook it for maybe 20, 25 minutes. So, you know, you just wanna make sure. you give your pie time to set, that's S-E-T, not S-I-T. So you want it to set and. you'll be able to tell, you can jiggle your pan and you will know. So 375, 10 minutes, then lower the oven. You know, when I was. filling up that pie crust, I said, oh my goodness,. it's gone be a fat pie. And remember it came all. the way up to the top. Well look, it covered up our crust, except for this small piece right here. I have found out that Bobby's oven in his guest house where. I'm living right now is not level. (chuckles) It kind of poured to that side. So it went into the. crust, but this is so hot. I'm not gonna even try to. cut it, but look at that. See that Eddie? Like it's perfectly set. - [Eddie] And it smells wonderful. - The smell is wonderful. So after it cools and I can cut it, we've got a hard decision to make. - [Eddie] I'm definitely gonna eat it. (both laugh) - Are we gone eat it. with fresh whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream. Decisions, decisions, Eddie. What are we gonna do? Oh, right now, I'm eating it with my nose. - [Eddie] Let's not tell. Michael about this one. - We gone hide this from Michael. We gone let him think all. we got around here is-- - Brussels sprouts.. - Brussels sprouts. (laughs) Fat boy ain't gone know about this pie. This'll make your Thanksgiving, y'all Think I'll make chocolate. and at the bottom. Yum. Oh, and don't forget when you cut this, if you have used a frozen pack rust, remember Emma had to slice. the first piece over here. So don't forget. Let me see. Don't forget when you cut your first piece to cut through that tin foil. So you can just lay it down and pull that first piece out perfectly. If this is the size piece we. want, which looks perfect. So see, I'm gone cut it. down a little bit more. So see we just gone take our tin foil and pull it all the way down. so we can just stick our spatula up in there or a pie server and just pull that first piece out. Just perfect. Love and best dishes, y'all. (chuckles);['postres']
HtOmeMStjl4.json;- Oh! (laughter) I didn't know Eddie was rolling, y'all. Um, you caught me with my. britches bout halfway up. (laughter) So, I told you earlier that uh, I had another recipe from up North, another recipe from New Hampshire, y'all and this too is from. Eddie's mother, Carol, and um, it's raisin pie. Now, I have never made a. raisin pie in my whole life and I'm so excited and Eddie, I want you to. share your memories with us about this pie. - [Eddie] This is actually. a cranberry raisin pie. - Oh, cranberry raisin,. yes I see that now. - [Eddie] Um, and I remember my uh, my. mother's mother I believe made it and um, I remember as a child, it. was one of those desserts that was on like the adult table with like the Rum balls, so you know, I think I. was a little bit older before I tried it, but it's, it's one of those desserts. that has the kind of like sweet, you know a sweet. and then tang to it. - Well, I thought this sounded very adult. - [Eddie] Yeah. - Like, so you have me. cooking two cups of sugar with two tablespoons of corn starch and a half a cup of water and Carol tells us to cook. that for about five minutes. So I think it's been five. minutes, don't you Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - [Paula] So now, I am gonna add um, one cup of raisins, four cups of fresh cranberries, oops, maybe I need to be using. - [Eddie] The big whisk? - [Paula] The big whisk. (laughter) All right. Four cups of cranberries and one tablespoon of. a grated orange rind. So, this, right now it kinda. sounds like cranberry sauce, doesn't it? A good old homemade cranberry sauce 'cause I, this is what I like to put in my cranberry sauce when I make it. So it said bring this to a rapid boil. Oh, and looks it's thick, Eddie. I hope I didn't cook it too long. - [Eddie] Um, I think you cook until you start hearing the. - [Paula] Well, I'm talking. about the first round, the two cups of sugar and the cornstarch and a half a cup of water, I hope I didn't cook it. over the five minutes that your mother has told us to cook it. Yeah, now these should start. popping open like any second and I'm gone, I'm gonna wash my whisk. If you'll watch that pot. for me please, Eddie. I bet you know how do that. for your mama, did you? - [Eddie] Uh, no. - [Paula] I bet you did. I bet you did. Okay, I just love this small whisk, but when you're using a big pot, it does have a tendency to, and y'all you know I'm living. in Bobby's guest house. It's located next to his. house that his family lives in and it's got that induction top and I'm really trying to adjust um, my cooking to this stove and when I think I've got. it, then I don't got it. (laughter) So uh, I'm doing, I'm doing pretty good, but I just love cooking with gas because when you want it on, it's on, and when you want it off, it's off. Hear em popping, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - So it said bring to a rapid boil, so I'm gonna turn this up, I'm gonna turn this stove top up to high. All right, now it's. starting to boil, Eddie. So was this passed down from. your grandmother to, or um? - [Eddie] I would say I. guess, it was probably. - [Paula] Did it come from a restaurant? - [Eddie] I think it would. have been my mother's mother. - Oh, and you know what? Those are the best recipes because uh, they come with so many memories and most of those memories are wonderful. - [Eddie] Yes. - How long has your grandmother been gone? - [Eddie] Oh gosh, I think I was in junior high. school when she passed away. - So it's been a long time. - [Eddie] So we had a mix,. this, this recipe and um, some of the others, um, could have been like from. the Canadian French side from my grandmother. - Well I would love to hear, 'cause your grandmother was. Canadian, French, Polish? - [Eddie] No, no, no. - Okay, the Polish side. is from your father? Okay. All right Eddie, look at that, that's a rapid boil, isn't it? - [Eddie] Yes, I would say. - [Paula] All right. I'm gonna cut this off and um, did your grandma speak French? - [Eddie] No. - She didn't? - [Eddie] No, I don't, I don't think so. (laughter) - But she had some kinda accent, surely. - [Eddie] I think, I. think she just had a uh, a New England accent. - And what's a New England accent? Is it like ca? And pock? - [Eddie] Yeah, like Boston. - I love that accent, I just love it. Love it, love it. All right so, Carol tells us. to let this cool completely and we're gonna, we're just using frozen. ready to go pie crust. You know, I don't have a. problem with these at all, although I don't like the. tin pan that it comes in, that's a dead giveaway, but you know, it's. actually a good product. I also like uh, the refrigerated pie dough. because you unroll it and you can put it in your own pie pan, so nobody would know. that you hadn't made it, mixed it up yourself and. if you like a thick crust, you know, it comes with two,. two crusts, two pie crusts, and I have put them. one on top of the other if I wanted a thicker. crust and do it that way and it, it's good, it. gives you a lot of crust. All right, so I've got. the second crust here and uh, after it has set out here and got more at room temperature, I'm gonna take this out of the pan and I'm gonna roll it a little bit and uh, because this is, this is a two. crust pie that we're making, so we'll roll this out. and we'll put it on top of our cranberries and raisins and we will um, brush it with a egg wash. Okay, it's about ready to come out. Okay, so it's gonna take. a while for this to cool, so I won't be gone long. Y'all go get ya something to drink, go to the bathroom, call a friend, do whatever you need to do and I'll be here waiting. on y'all to come back. Who's ready to finish. the cranberry raisin pie? I am. I am, so this has gotten. cool for us, y'all, and I'm just gonna, look, look, look, look at that beautiful pie. Eddie just said, oh, with. some vanilla ice cream. He said it's so good. But now, I'm like your mother, Eddie, I don't know if the children will be very crazy about this one because I just tasted. it and it's very tart, it'll make your lips pucker. (laughter) Hm, look at that, that filled up that pie and we're using a deep dish, right? - [Eddie] Yes. - [Paula] A deep dish pie. Okay. So, I got our second crust rolled out and then I'm gonna try to just fold this, the extra under to make a little thicker crust and then we'll see if we can't kinda pretty it up a little bit by using a fork on it, or our thumbs. I'm glad to see that Eddie's mother made this a two crust pie because that's gonna help. cut some of the tartness, right Eddie? - [Eddie] Oh yeah. - [Paula] Oh honey, I'm fixing. to put sugar on top of it. (laughter) I've got some Turbinado sugar that I think I'm gonna sprinkle on it. Let's see, I think, I think that I will just rather fork this, it looks like that kinda pie to me. So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get a little flour and a fork and I'm gonna get my tongues in the flour. This really reminds me. of an old timey pie, when your grandmother just used to, didn't do anything fancy, just used her fork and made that really. homemade looking crust. This is gonna look like a. cherry pie cooking, Eddie, you know it? - [Eddie] Yeah it will, yeah you know, it kinda has that tart, you know. - [Paula] Uh huh, cherry pie is tart. - [Eddie] I think adding. the raisins adds you know, the extra sweetness. - [Paula] Listen, I love. raisins on my salad, or anything like that because um, the sweetness that the. raisin brings to the table, is so good. So that's very pretty, isn't it? Very homemade-y looking. That flour will bake off but now, look, I was looking for my egg y'all. (laughter) And look. - [Eddie] The bad elf. - [Paula] Look who stole my egg. That elf on the shelf. (laughter) I think he might be the. naughty elf, you think? He looks a little devilish. (laughter) All right, go find you something else to mess with, Elvie. My grandchildren all love, I was out at Jamie's, Eddie and I went out to Jamie. and Brooke's the other night and Maddie had to show me. where the elf at his house had flown and that elf had flown up to like the top of a tall mirror. I mean, he must, he must. have good wings or something. All right, now where is that brush? Here we go. Now this, this uh, egg wash is gonna give this pie a beautiful sheen. It's gonna just shine. Because you know we eat. this first with our eyes. I have to make sure we get that flour work covered up good. All right, and Theresa said, gosh, that would be good. with some sugar on it. And I thought, I am with you, sister. I've got some Turbinado sugar in here and I love to put that on some. of my cookies that I bake. It's so good, now all I. have to do is find it. Let's see, that's a coconut sugar and this is the Turbinado. and this is the Turbinado and this one's open,. so let's use this one. Now this pie only has to bake like 25 minutes, y'all. So that's pretty short for a pie. So what y'all think, kiddies? (laughter) I know! All right, now I'm gonna. take, oh, it's a heavy pie. And every bit of its. gonna go to my middle. Okay, now I've topped it. with our Turbinado sugar and this is it, you just get. it from the grocery store, it's in the same department. as your regular sugar and now, I'm gonna cut some slits in this so it will vent. And I'm gonna give it. just like three slits. Or maybe I'll do four. Or who knows? I think five would be better and another right there. just for good measure. Okay, so we'll be able to see that beautiful red cranberry. bubbling out of there. So 25 minutes on what, 375? Eddie, is that right? Yes. And Carol, Eddie's mother, said, I brush the crust with a. little milk or an egg wash. 375 to 400 for 25 minutes,. or until crust is brown, but for this oven, you know, I don't know it as well as I knew my own ovens, so I'm, I'm gonna cook this one at 375 and that little beep just told me that our oven had reached. the temperature of 375, so I'm gonna set my timer for 25 minutes and this is going in the oven. Whoa! Did y'all about see that? (laughter) That's why you should. always use two hands. I'm gonna put him back in the center, that's one, that's one. beautiful pie, Eddie. So in 25 minutes, how long do we have to let it cool before we can taste it? - [Eddie] Dig right in. - Huh? - [Eddie] Dig right in. - Dig right in. (laughter) Okie doke. We'll see you for the tasting. I want y'all to look at this. beautiful raisin cranberry pie. Look how beautiful. The Turbinado sugar that I. put on top of the egg wash, it's just made it so. shiny and so beautiful. I don't know though if this has cooled down. enough for us to slice it, but would y'all like for me to try? Who would like for me to? Okay, so Theresa and Eddie say yes. I'm saying there's a good chance that it can run everywhere. Because. - [Theresa] When has that ever stopped us? - [Paula] I know. (laughter) Look at that, it looks. like a cherry pie, y'all. Look at that. Uh oh. I got some cleaning up to do. (laughter) It's gonna run, y'all. It's gonna run. - [Theresa] It's running? - [Paula] It's running,. but not real, real bad. Hm, hm. If I didn't know. - [Theresa] I was gonna. say, that's a good run. - [Paula] If I didn't know better, I would say it was a cherry pie. Okay, I only see one fork here. - [Theresa] Well who else needs to, I mean, this is mine. (laughter) - [Paula] So you saying. Eddie and I don't need one? - [Theresa] Y'all can share that. - There you go. Come on, let's bite into it. That crust is just amazing. - [Theresa] Yum! That was not as tart as, I. thought it would be tarter. - That is delicious, Eddie. But to me, it is an adult pie. - [Eddie] Totally. - [Theresa] Yes, this is definitely not. - [Paula] And that top. crust on it, just makes it. - [Theresa] If this had. some cherries in it, in addition, I would love it. - [Paula] It still tastes like cherry pie. Eddie, well, I'm talking straight. to Carol Zorawowicz, thank you Carol for giving these recipes to your son so he could share them with everybody, you're so sweet and I've, I miss not being able to see you and I know your son definitely has. How long has it been. Eddie, like three years? - [Eddie] Oh no, it's only. been a year since I saw her. - No, since I saw her. - [Eddie] Oh, since you saw her, yeah, yeah it's been three years. - That's what I thought. I don't remember. Just a year ago, but thank you Carol and if you got any more treasures, just give your son a call and we'll share them with. the rest of the world. So love and best dishes.;['postres']
i9scJUnK3P4.json;"- Hey, y'all come on in, because it's Valentine's in my mind, especially for the next few days. I'm gonna be wearing my Valentine shirt, with my hearts on it. I've already got messed up. Only wear this once a year,. so this is that time of year. Now, I'm going to share with y'all, which is something that. I think's so much fun, especially for Valentines. If you're sitting across. from your significant other, your husband, your wife, your girlfriend, your grandchildren, whomever, you're sharing this with,. it's just so much fun. And it became a big thing,. I remember, in 1966 and '67. It was all about fondues, and there's different kinds. of fondues that you can do. You can do the sweet, or. you can do the savory. I know my oldest grandson. Jack loves, loves fondue, and there's a place here in town, right? That- - [Teresa] Yes, ma'am. - You fondue at your table. - [Teresa] The Melting Pot. - The Melting Pot. That's a good name for it, isn't it? - [Eddie] That is one of Jack's- - It is one of Jack's favorite places. And so today I'm gonna. share with y'all an easy, easy way to do the chocolate fondue. So I've got one cup of heavy. cream, and I'm gonna pour it into my pan, and y'all, I've just got to say for a second, this is my newest set of pots and pans, and I just love them. They, I insisted that they all had a pour spout, because it's so aggravating to have a solid, perfectly round pot, and you're trying to pour. it into a small space. So this is one of the things- uh-oh. This is one of the things. that I insisted on, if we could do it, was. making those pour spouts. Now, I've just poured one cup. of heavy cream into my pot. Oh, and I didn't tell you. where you could get these if you're interested, if. you need a new set of pots and pans at a reasonable price. These are good ones, and you can see, I asked for a dimpled. pattern, which to me, that doesn't show as many. scratches and wear and tear as a solid does, but you. can go to the Amazon store, Paula Deen, and find these, and they're in all of our gift stores. If y'all are visiting one of Paula Deen's Family. Kitchen Restaurants, you can find 'em there, and they come in all different colors. For my kitchen preference, I use, I like the silver and the blue, and the blue cookware is the color of my air fryer over there, so. Anyway, back to this, I'm heating up one cup. of heavy whipping cream. Now, we don't want this to boil. We're not gonna bring it to a boil, so it'll take a few minutes, because I've got it on low heat. And then we're gonna add milk chocolate, because I love and adore milk chocolate. So to that, we're gonna add. two teaspoons of Grand Marnier, and this is gonna give it. the nicest orange flavor. And I have here fresh strawberries that have been washed and dried. I have pound cake, little. bites of pound cake, or you could do a cookie,. whatever you happen to have. And I love the pineapple. I'm gonna watch this closely, because I don't want it to boil. So fonduing is just that easy, and it's a very interactive. way to have dessert, or even have a meal. Michael and I both like. the ones where you make a broth, and put your meat. in 'em, cook your meat in it. Those are good too. And sauces, you know? You gotta have some good, good sauces. And I hope to be sharing. some recipes with y'all soon for tips on fonduing, because one of the ladies that works, and actually does the editing and works, she leads up our social. media part of the company, and they are big fonduers. She said her father-in-law has got an A-plus on fonduing skills. So I said, ""Okay, you. tell your father-in-law,"" bless you, ""to send some good tips."" All right, y'all well, this. is kind of starting to smoke a little bit, so I'm. gonna go ahead and add our milk chocolate, and. I suggest that you chop your chocolate, because. it'll melt quicker, and more uniform. So I'm gonna stir this constantly to keep it from coming to a boil. And then I'll lower the. temperature even more, because after we get. this all mixed together, we're gonna put it in our fondue pot, and we're gonna break some. bread together, aren't we? - I'm gonna turn this to warm. - Please do. - Just so it will be ready. - Please do, please. - And the nice thing is on. the fondue pot, it tells you. Your chocolate, you warm to 200. - Oh, that's good. - Cheese goes higher. - Okay, it's starting to come together, and that chocolate is. melting and blended in to that heavy cream. Love milk chocolate. Love it, love it, love it. All right, so how long does. it take for that to get warm? - [Teresa] Oh, I think it'll. be fine once you're ready. - Well, I'm gonna go ahead and add the liqueur, and it calls for two teaspoons. Three teaspoons equals a tablespoon, so I'm gonna use a tablespoon,. and just go, not quite to the top, so that's. equal out to two teaspoons. - [Teresa] It's al ready for you. - It is ready? Well, this is really for you. So, now, normally we would plug this in where we were gonna sit and eat, so everybody could reach it. Whoa! Did you hear that sizzling, Teresa? Is this your fondue at your house, or is it one you brought for- - [Teresa] I got that for this one. I did used to have fondue pots. - I used to have one too. - [Teresa] I'm like Jack. I used to go to a fondue restaurant for my birthday every year. - Really? - [Eddie] I've never been. (overlapping chatter) - We'll have to go get,. pick up Jack one night, and get him to teach us the ropes, Eddie. - [Eddie] Yeah. - [Teresa] I'm coming. - All right, so here is the. things that we've selected to dip into our fondue. And your fondue pots. come with your skewers. That's hard to say. And each of them are a. different color on the end, and we need to use this, especially today, with different viruses running around. So you know your color, and. you don't use anybody else's but the one you're supposed to be using, which is your color. All right, because I'm wearing red, I'm gonna pick the red one. What color do you want? - [Teresa] I'm going with pink. - Okay. - [Teresa] Ooh, look, it's bubbling. You might want to turn it down. Great day! That pot works-. - I'm gonna turn it off. Eddie, you're white. - [Eddie] Or red. - [Teresa] He just took your red. - [Eddie] Oh, you're red. - Oh. (laughing) - [Eddie] Or is it, I dunno what I want. - [Paula] Oh, you don't want white. Okay.. - [Eddie] I want green. (Eddie laughing) - [Teresa] I tried to pick. Valentine's Day colors in here. He goes off on his own. (Eddie and Paula laughing) - All right, y'all, there's a good chance that you're gonna be having. to turn this off and on, 'cause you don't want it to boil, unless you're doing the savory, and then you want that broth good and hot so it won't literally fly, (chuckles) fry your food. That's tough to say all those F's. So I'm gonna start with pineapple. What would y'all like? - [Teresa] I'm gonna do poundcake. - [Paula] Mm oh, ooh. So I'd love to hear from. y'all about fonduing. Do y'all still fondue? Is it big in your family? And what is your favorite thing to fondue? I'm so curious. - [Teresa] They do all kinds of flavors. - [Paula] Mm. - [Teresa] Mm. - [Paula] Mm. All right, so now I'm. gonna try the pound cake, and the beauty of this. is you don't have to make your own cake. They make these little frozen. loaf pans of pound cake, and those are great to keep in the freezer to use on the fly, although something that. I love to do, if I see, I bake a poundcake, and. it's not gonna get red, it's not gonna get eaten right away, I'll wrap it up in maybe. two slices at the time, and put it in the freezer. - [Teresa] Mm. - So if you do things like that- What do I want now? What are y'all gonna have next? I'm gonna go with this strawberry. - [Teresa] And you can do bananas. (overlapping chatter) - Uh-oh. - [Teresa] You can do brownie pieces. - Yes, there's so many things. That's why I'm asking. people out there, you know? People out there, they've. got such great imaginations, and I'd love to hear from. y'all, 'cause I'm curious. Chocolate and strawberries. just go together, don't they? So happy Valentine's Day. Whoever you're sharing it. with, I hope they love it. - [Teresa] Mm. - Mm, mm.";['postres']

iPfmN15V8DI.json;- Hey everybody. It's Bobby here on the Paula. Deen channel on YouTube. Thanks for tuning in with us. I've got a really, well we, Teresa and I, have a really great recipe here for you. This is perfect for a pool party or a really hot sunny July. afternoon at your house. We put something together. that we're gonna have out by the pool a little bit later on for the kids when they. wake up from their nap. And this is an Ice Cream Sundae Pizza. It sounds decadent, and it is really decadent. This is totally for fun. and probably not every day but the kids will love it. And you'll love it too. And you'll see here in just a minute this is not gonna be a. lot of action on my part. Theresa has done a lot. of the prep work for me because you needed a few hours to do it. And I'll explain that. What we started with, well we started with a big. round pizza shaped baking dish. And we took one box of. just standard brownie mix off your grocery store shelf, and we made it exactly how. they tell you to make it. And we put it in the baking pan and we baked it off for, I would check it at maybe 15 or 20 minutes because in this well,. let's just look at it. - [Teresa] That's actually. Bobby, a deep dish-- - Pizza - [Teresa] Pizza pan. - Okay. Yeah. This is a deep dish pizza pan. And so you can imagine. one box of brownie mix is gonna spread really,. really thin in there. So, so you don't burn it, you'd want to check it. in about 15 minutes at, you know I'd put it in the oven for 350. That's what Teresa did. And we've got some Blue Bell ice cream. That is my mom's favorite. I think that she says. that to you all the time how much she likes Blue Bell ice cream and all the grandkids in the family. Everybody goes wild for that when momma serves it at her house. So we've got the brownie mix in the pan. This is a deep dish. pizza pan, and baked it. And we let the ice cream. soften on the counter and we let the brownie mix cool after we baked it in the oven. This was, Theresa did. all this a long time ago, 'cause I didn't have that kind of time. So now this thing is frozen. solid sitting here on my counter and where the ice cream comes in, if I didn't already say it is, we let it sit on the counter and soften, and then we spread a half. gallon of Blue Bell ice cream all over the top of that brownie. (Bobby laughing) - [Teresa] Bobby. We just did another one. We've done a lot of ice cream this summer. - This is gonna taste so, so good. If you look to my left over here, you'll see that we have Hershey's Caramel and we have Hershey's Hot Fudge Sundae and we have maraschino cherries and we have heavy whipped cream. And for the health nut in you we've got some chopped almonds here. This is gonna be so. good, but it's gonna be-- - [Teresa] Those are chopped peanuts. - Chopped peanuts, I'm sorry. This is gonna be so good but it's gonna be so. fattening and delicious. So happy summer. All right. Well, our pizza is put together so let's go ahead and cut a piece. Do you, what do you think Teresa? Should I try to cut one piece or should I go ahead and cut the thing? - [Teresa] I would go down the middle. - Yeah, let's go all the way. Oh, that's cutting perfectly too. That's like the consistency of a really really cold cheese cake. is what that feels like. - [Teresa] And it does take, just so you know, it takes about four hours and it tells you that you can cut it anywhere from two hours to two days and you can leave it in the. freezer before you serve it. - [Bobby] Yeah. Two days, I think I might push the limits and go to two days on this thing. Yeah, let it just be a nice frozen piece of, what do you think? Oh, look at those big delicious pieces of Ice Cream Sundae Pizza. Those are pretty generous portions. I may have to. I may have to do an extra cut. - [Teresa] Well, the. nice thing about this too is you can do a piece at a time. - [Bobby] Yeah. - [Teresa] And then that way it can last for a couple of days. (Bobby laughing) - The middle of it-- - [Teresa] Just what we need in our refrigerators or freezers. - Look, look, you're kidding yourself, and you're lying to everybody if you say that this is gonna last for a couple days 'cause it ain't. - [Teresa] Well not with your triplets. - Judge all you want, but this is gonna be so, so delicious. So. - [Teresa] Here we go. - [Bobby] Yeah, these are so big. - [Teresa] It's okay. - [Bobby] These are so big. - [Teresa] Your mom would be proud of us. - [Bobby] Oh my we, my. mom, my mom, my mom, my mama. My mama would be very proud of this. Yes. Okay. - [Teresa] You're good. - [Bobby] Oh, wow. - [Teresa] Oh it's not. - [Bobby] Yeah, it's completely cut, but my spatula is gonna. tear it up a little bit down here on the end. So in an effort to not do. that, let me double spatula. See if I can keep from tearing it up. Not that it matters 'cause. it's gonna get torn up anyway. Oh yeah. - [Teresa] Oh yeah. Let me go in and show. them so they can see that. Can you pick that up just a little bit, 'cause it's kind of hard. to see the chocolate? - [Bobby] That brownie's. thin on the bottom. - [Teresa] It is thin. - [Bobby] Let's see. Let's see if we can see it maybe a little better inside. the deep dish pizza pan. - [Teresa] Well now one of the. things that everybody knows with the economy as it is, the brownie mixes are. smaller than they used to be. - [Bobby] Yeah. - [Teresa] But you. still can use the same-- - [Bobby] Ooh sorry. - [Teresa] You can still. use the same brownie size. It's just gonna be a little thinner than what the 21 ounce would've done. - And that's why we. talked about it earlier. You don't want to bake this in the oven too long at 350, 'cause it would definitely burn after, you know maybe more than. about 15 to 20 minutes. All right. So I'm gonna pop the rest of our pizza back into the freezer. - [Teresa] Yeah. You have. to move quick with this. - Huh? - [Teresa] You have to move. quick with this recipe. - Yeah you do or else. it's gonna melt on you. Okay. Let's do, a little caramel. Ooh. - [Teresa] Good catch. - [Bobby] Little bit of hot fudge sundae. Yeah, I'm a cat. Little bit of hot fudge sundae. Oh boy. Little bit of nuts right on top of that. That would be good to go just like that. That looks really, really. - [Teresa] But you're gonna keep going. - [Bobby] But I'm gonna keep going. And. (whip cream spraying) - [Teresa] That is real whipped cream. - [Bobby] That is real whipped cream. And my mom would say. that that is not enough. And right on top of. that, maraschino cherry. That is your cherry on top. And look how good that looks. Ice Cream Sundae Pizza. So that is one brownie mix in the box and you make it just exactly. like they tell you to do it. We used a deep dish pizza pan, spread the the brownie. mix in there really thin all across the bottom. We softened a tub of Blue Bell ice cream and spread it all over. the top of the brownie mix after it came out of the. oven and cooled a little bit. That sounds amazing. Doesn't it? And then we added to that some Hershey's Caramel and. some hot fudge topping, and a little bit of chopped peanuts and a maraschino cherry with. some heavy whipped cream. So this is definitely one of those treats for you and your family. And I'm gonna take one for the team and let you know whether. or not it is any good. Hmm. - [Teresa] You're trying to act like, you know you want the whole piece and you can't have the whole piece - That is amazing and. delicious in every way. So. - [Teresa] See Bobby, this is why it doesn't pay to be healthy. - Well happy summer everybody. Sometimes you gotta have fun in life. Mm mm mm mm.;['postres']
IRdyZqhzZII.json;hey y'all look who's in the kitchen with me the captain is here you know what I think he heard me say hi yeah so you know I have asked y'all for requests on things you'd like to see me prepare and Michael my friend Gail Gail Daniel yes uh she requested me to make peanut butter pie so I have just beat up one and a half cups of heavy cream with a third of a cup of sugar and you can stick your finger in there Michael if you want to if it's clean is your fingers clean if they have to stay on my whipping cream I think that's good that has my approval all right so I've got to get another Bowl because Michael you have a good peanut butter pie okay Therese gonna have a good peanut butter pie we've got to blend all the ingredients up real good so if you want to Michael you can uh time to help me first yeah you want to wash your hands just in case I don't know where he'd been that's why I didn't want to they're clean but I wasn't sure he's been hanging out in his garage so he says it clean but now they're going to be cleaner oh he just took a shower he is clean um okay so we're gonna put our pie together and we're gonna start by using one cup of smooth peanut butter now if you like the crunchy do the crunchy I just happen to like it smooth crunchy you do well I can't believe that we disagree on something all right so Michael I'm gonna ask you yeah let me do something okay I'm gonna ask you to put that gum at these mixers are old I mean these beaters all right that's just got whipping cream on it and that won't hurt it a bit because it's all gonna go together okay all right so we're gonna add one eight ounce package of softened whipped cream okay I can do that yes cream cheese I mean cream cheese whipped cream whipped cream the whipped cream's coming but right now Michael you are just beating up the peanut butter and cream cheese yes but now if I recall that says peanut butter pie right well no that's nothing Sharp so I'm gonna add just a little bit of butter that's like three tablespoons right there get in there so there we go everything's better with butter on it y'all what a chocolate what Corn Flakes I don't I don't all right now we're gonna add how much sugar did we say Therese that's a cup gosh it looks like more than a cup of confection sugar 10x or 4X whatever you have so there you go Mikey I'm gonna ask you to trade spots with you because and if you'll move that bowl right up the bear um do you remember why you like my peanut butter pie so much I kind of like all your pies well put a little candy into my custard and I've got some miniature peanut butter cups that I'm just gonna chop up and in the past Michael if I didn't have these I would cut up like Snickers or any kind of candy chocolate candy that has like peanuts in it all right all right so turn that thing up and really give it a beep beep beep all right is that good and smooth yeah all right now turn it back on low and slowly lift your beaters up and flip the stuff off of them okay and you got to move your thumb so I can get to oh oh okay that's it all right no that's not it yet gotta fold it in all right so we've got um we started with a cup and a half of whipping cream that we sweetened with a third of a cup of sugar now we're gonna fold oh gosh let me see well I would use the bigger one I'm Gonna Save a little bit Michael for the top yes just so when we have our piece of pie thank you all right in goes the peanut butter candy and that's gonna be the best surprise in there y'all I'm Gonna Save a few to chop and put on the top so Gail I really do think you're gonna like this peanut butter pie recipe you can make it for your brother okay fold fold fold she makes a lot of cookies yeah yes I know she brings us wonderful cookies she likes using anise and her cookies okay that's about got it Mikey okay put it in okay almost okay almost we want that white go all right now put it in and y'all I'm using a store-bought graham cracker crust um because remember these are supposed to be quick and easy uh usually I will make my own graham cracker crust with graham cracker crumbs or you can use a um a flower crust and bake it off in the oven but this makes it really really easy it is beautiful isn't it look at that all right so Mikey we are going to put this in the refrigerator and let that cream cheese and butter harden up a little bit and it ain't gonna be long for I'm gonna put some of these on top of that girl no after we do our cream on it but you can if you want to I just hadn't chopped them yet like a bonus as you think but then I'm not gonna have any put on top of the whipped cream all right so put that in the fridge here wait wait wait wait waste not won't not oh gosh a good Heap and tablespoon I would have to wash it that's right all right all right refrigerator in the refrigerator so Gail are you ready for your peanut butter pie cause it's ready for you girl this has been sitting in the refrigerator now we let it we let it firm back up and I want to share a tip with y'all that I think is just a lifesaver when it comes to slicing pies because you know sometimes they can be messy so I'm gonna come into the center of this peanut butter pie oh and using an already ready-made crust just makes it so much easier now this is really really rich so you might want to cut small pieces all right so this peanut butter pie is really easy to get out but if you're doing a cream pie or something like that that's you just know you're going to break that first piece out well when you cut when you're using an already prepared uh pie crust that's in the little tins this is what you do you take your scissors and you come in where you made that First Slice and then you go back and you make another slice and then you just pull that down just like that and look how beautifully your piece of pie comes out isn't that beautiful yes ma'am it is it's beautiful so y'all remember I I put aside some some of my sweetened whipped cream because I like to serve it with a dollop and then I like to put a little peanut butter cup on top and it's ready for the captain but guess what the captain ain't here he's only ship working so look at that spinning around oh you're mine honey you ain't going nowhere crap that is so good it is so good Gail I think you're gonna love it girl [Music];['postres']

iTUhgI_KsnA.json;"- All right, I've got about a. half a cup of orange marmalade that I do love on a. bagel with cream cheese. Now, I'm going to just warm that slightly. And this is gonna be our. Fourth of July dessert for the children. So, maybe the mamas can't. say, oh, it's too much sugar. Since it's going to be a fruit pizza, maybe we can get away with it. So, I know you have all. probably seen the fruit pizzas and it's one of those things, excuse me, that you can do it any way you want to. But since it's the Fourth of July, I am just sticking with. red fruit, blue fruit, and banana is going to have to. work as our white, excuse me. Whoa, Paula, you turned too quick. I got dizzy. All right, yeah, that's warm. Okay, so to make our cookie, all you need is one like 17 ounce. roll of a sugar cookie. You know, they come in the. log and you can either try to roll it out. Personally, I don't like to do that. I like to just slice it and. pat it out with my hands and that way I know it's even and cook it for the proper amount of time. So, and it's best that. you do this beforehand so it has time to cool. So now, we're going to. take our cream cheese that we have let soften. I do love cream cheese. And I'm using, excuse me for licking my fingers. I'm going to use a half a. teaspoon of an orange extract, which is so nice and fresh. Okay, so we're going to come down here and mix this with that wonderful. aromatic orange extract. You know, we used to give. our children and myself as a child an ice cream that. was called a dreamsicle. And it was vanilla ice. cream with an orange cream like it was dipped, like they dipped the vanilla. into this orange cream and it was so good. So, this particular extract is so good. I think I might soften. some vanilla ice cream and drop in a few drops. of the orange extract and sit back and let my. memories take me away. I'm going to stir that and make sure there's no lumps in it. Make sure it's got enough orange extract. And I don't think it does. So, I'm going to add just a wee bit more. Let's see if that takes it to. where I'd like for it to be. So, that would be about. a teaspoon that I used. That's a little better, but I think I'm gonna reach over here and grab my lemon extract and put a little lemon in it. To take me to where I want to go. Okay, so, Eddie found. it up in the cabinet. I have forgotten about,. I used this other day. I made a lemon pound cake, y'all, using Mama's pound cake recipe and I made a lemon glaze. That cake was so delicious. So, I had used this extract in that cake. Okay, so let's see, you know, preparing food. And what you're going to. give your a family is really all it needs to pass is your taste test. That's a little bit more of. a little bit of bite to it. So we're going to come down here and we're going to take our cream cheese and we're going to frost our big cookie. So hopefully, we'll. have enough cream cheese to complete our job. Your children, if you. would call your children into the kitchen to help. you with this process, they would have a ball. So, since this is a. Fourth of July dessert, we should try to do the red,. white, and blue, shouldn't we? - That's what we've got. - The white bananas, the. strawberries, and the blueberries. So I'm going to ask you to put. your artistic eyeball on it. - But we don't have to a, we. want to do a flag or do you... - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter. - This is your pallet. - Okay. - It's your pallet. I'm going to be the fruit slicer. All right, those have been washed. Those are ready to go. Now, I'm going to mix. up a little Fruit-Fresh because the bananas... - Now, where does this come in? - [Woman] At the very end. - At the very end. - Yeah, that was kind of unfair. You can read the recipe. It's very simple. It's kind of do it like you want it. The actual recipe called. for a lot more fruit but Theresa wanted us to just stick to our red, white, and blue. So, I've got some Fruit-Fresh here. That I'm going to. sprinkle on these bananas or if you don't have Fruit-Fresh, you can use lemon juice,. or lime juice even, orange juice will help. slow it down a little bit. Okay, then we go in Fruit-Fresh, you will find in the canning. section at your grocery store. You know, where they keep. the jars, the canning jars and things like that. So, I'm just going to. sprinkle a little bit on it and then I'm going to add. just a touch of water, so it can all get coated. What you want, pumpkin? Pumpkin wants... - [Eddie] She wants... - [Paula] Pizza pie? - [Eddie] Food. - [Paula] And look, there's Gus and Max now they, I said something about pumpkin and then here they go. All right, here's your banana, Eddie. - [Eddie] All right. - [Paula] You know, if. ya'll make this pizza, send us some pictures. because I just love to know what's in y'all's head and. how y'all would do things. So, send us a picture if you decide to create your recipe of the fruit pizza because I would love to see it. - [Woman] I'm going to give Eddie a break and let him keep doing his creation. - [Paula] Okay, and then come back? - [Woman] And then we'll come back. - [Paula] That sounds wonderful. Wah-lah! - [Woman] I haven't done the big reveal. - [Paula] Look, look. at Eddie's fruit pizza. All right, Eddie, our. instructions are to brush on... - [Eddie] Warm marmalade. - [Paula] This warm marmalade,. so I'm just going to kind of dot it around for you. - [Woman] Yeah. - [Paula] And I actually added, cause the marmalade is a little thick, I actually added a. little warm water to it. - [Woman] That looks so good. - [Eddie] So that's going to. add a lot of orange flavor. - [Woman] That's going. to add some flavor too. - [Paula] A lot of orange flavor. Oh, and I added some, yum, I added orange extract to this one too. To the orange marmalade, just in case it didn't have enough orange in it. - [Woman] That looks great. - [Paula] Isn't that beautiful? - [Woman] Yes. - [Paula] Eddie is so a talented. Where do you feel like I. need to do this all last drop of orange marmalade, baby? - [Eddie] Right there. - [Paula] Right in there. - [Paula] Yeah, that's what I thought. - [Woman] Kind of empty. And maybe I can get one. more little spec for you by using my rubber spatula. - [Woman] I always have to go to you trying to get the very last drop. - [Paula] My handy dandy rubber spatula. All right, do you have,. look, see how much I got? Now, most folks would have left that. - [Eddie] Right there. - [Paula] Would have left. that in that bowl, but not me. You would've thought I lived during the depression, y'all. Yummy. But now, here are the directions serve and eat immediately, because, because your bananas are gonna turn on you if you're not careful. And that's why I use the Fruit-Fresh to help give them a little extra life. - [Eddie] Yeah, the marmalade. should kind of help that too. - [Paula] Yeah, help. give it a little coat, but the Fruit-Fresh is really. the one that's gonna... - [Woman] Now that's sugar. cookie on the bottom? - [Paula] Yes. Eddie, I'm going to. give you a paper plate. - [Eddie] I've got some right here. - [Paula] You've got paper plates? - [Eddie] No, I've got real plates. - [Paula] Oh no, I want. to take a paper plate out to the grandchildren. - [Eddie] Okay. - [Paula] Because I don't. want no China by the pool. - [Woman] I think Bobby. Dean will appreciate that. - [Paula] He's not going. to appreciate the fact though that we're bringing them pie. And they may let them. have it and they may not but that's all right. You want the pie server? - [Eddie] Yeah - [Paula] Look at this, look. at those boys over there. He's playing and playing and playing. - [Woman] I Think Gus must be. - [Paula] Gus. - [Woman] I think Gus is tired. - [Paula] Gus, what are you doing, buddy? - [Woman] Say I'm checking it all out. - [Paula] Ooh. - [Woman] Oh look. - [Eddie] Are you going. to take three pieces or are you going to take...? - [Paula] Yeah, let's take a few because - [Woman] Will you turn it. around so I can kind of see that? - [Paula] The swimming coach. - [Woman] Look. - [Paula] Isn't that gorgeous? Give me that blueberry, honey. And I'll take some. - [Eddie] It's like Queen Elizabeth cutting that cake with that big sword. - This fruit pizza is. out this world y'all and the triplets are out doing. their survival swimming class. So, I'm going to take this and maybe Mama and Papa. will let them have some. And I want Mr. Steven,. the teacher, to have some. So, Mr. Steven, we just. made a fruit pizza. - [Mr. Steven] Awesome. - And I've cut you a slice over there. - [Mr. Steven] Okay. - So make sure you don't leave without it. - [Mr. Steven] Will do. - You need some bulking up. - I do. I need more fruit pizza. - [Paula] And it's delicious. - [Mr. Steven] I bet it is. - [Paula] Jackie, you make. sure to get some too, honey. - I will, thank you. - [Woman] I see you, pretty girl. - [Jackie] Say, ""I'm just. working on my starfish."" - Oh boy, look at that. - [Mr. Steven] Thank you. - So, just let me know when they're ready. - [Jackie] Yes ma'am, I will. - It's out of this world.

IxKwwd5pZVM.json;"- Happy 12 days of. Christmas cookies, y'all. I'm onto our next recipe. And that is a white. chocolate cherry cookie, or chunky, White. Chocolate Cherry Chunkies. And it sounds very similar to what my precious cousin, Don. Hiers, makes every Christmas. When he gets here for the holidays, the first thing I say is, ""are you making the cookies today, the cherry chewy cookies?"" Well, this recipe is. just a little different, but this is, I'm making. it and dedicating it to my dear, sweet cousin, Don Hiers. So, we've got a stick of butter, and that's always a great start, y'all. I'm gonna move this out of our way, how about that, Eddie? So you don't have to shoot around that. Now, this butter has been. softened to room temperature, and I'm gonna add my white sugar, I'm gone add my dark brown sugar, and I'm just gonna beat. those until it's creamy. These are really easy cookies to make. Don's are, well, they're beautiful and they're so good,. but his are a little bit more intense than these, 'cause you have to make an icing for his, and then you have to frost them all. And so this way, we're. gonna mix, mix, mix, but hopefully get that same. kinda good cherry flavor that Don's cookies have. (mixer running) All right, and my recipe that. I have calls for vanilla. Now, this is where I would. like to switch this up, 'cause, you know, I'm. not really good about doing my recipes like I. write 'em all the time. So I would prefer almond flavoring, because almonds make you. think you're eating cherries. So do we have any almond. flavoring anywhere, gang? - [Eddie] I don't think so. - No? - [Theresa] This move is killing us. - I know it. Theresa said,. this move is killing us, because we're just here temporarily because we're having some. reconstruction done on my house, so we can't move in until all that's done. So we're just kinda like half here. (laughing) We got just enough to get us by. - [Theresa] And for every recipe, you've asked for something we haven't had. - I know it.. (laughs) - [Eddie] Well, construction. hadn't started there yet. - That's alright. No, construction hadn't started, so, boo. - [Eddie] We're just sneaking in here. - I don't think I'll be able to film when construction starts, do y'all? - [Theresa] No, that's why. we're trying to get these done. - Yes. - [Theresa] So we don't have. to, we don't skip a beat. - All right, look at this, y'all. I remembered to break my egg. in a separate bowl on that one. Thank goodness the first one was good. Okay, so I've got my vanilla. in there, I've got my egg. (blending) What is that, milk? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Okay, we gone beat this up some and try to get it a little bit creamier before I add the milk. (blending) Yeah, see, it's getting real creamy. And I just love cookies that have brown sugar in them, y'all. All right, I'm gonna put this down so this milk won't fly all over me. (blending) Now it's safe to turn it back up, I think. (blending) Oh, Don, honey, you've. got to try this recipe 'cause it's so much easier. than that that you make. Although it's so delicious,. and it's kinda worth it. Uh-oh, what have I done? All right, now I've got to reach over here and add my flour. And this is what's gonna bring. these cookies over the top is candied cherries that. have been roughly chopped. My favorite nut in the whole world, maybe second to a pecan, macadamia nuts, and they're so expensive. And white chocolate chips. So I'm just gone stir those together, and then we'll just fold. this in at the last minute. And I think I mentioned on one of the shows that I've already done that next Christmas, I wanna. do the 12 days of Christmas, but I want to do y'all's 12. days of Christmas cookies. I wanna find out what. y'all's favorite cookies are and do those for y'all. - [Jackie] Hello! - Hola! (indistinct chatter) Hola! (laughing) Guess who's here, y'all,. Guess who is here! Oh my goodness! Guess who's here, y'all. The triplets. Hey, Jackie! - [Jackie] Hey, how are ya? - You want to decorate some gingerbread? Oh darling. Oh, you got to be pretty for Papa mama. Oh, who is over here? Meow! (Laughing) Eddie, there's Eddie. You want to get down, baby? (indistinct chatter) - I wore you a bell! Okay. I'm just still,. just adding the flour, and I'm kind of doing it in batches, just so it won't be overpowering for our wet mixture that we got going. I think I did that, this. will be the fourth batch. (blending) Like I said cousin Don,. this is a lot easier than that one that you make, but I hope it's at least half as good. If I remember correctly,. it's very good, so we'll see. Alright, so we're just gone mix that up and then, you know I added our candied cherries, um, my favorite nut in the whole world, macadamia nut, and white chocolate chips. So you can see those cherries are gonna give these cookies such. a pretty bright color. It's gone be cheerful. and Christmasy looking. (blending) Okay, that flung off pretty clean. Alright, so we're just going to fold those three ingredients in and I just love white chocolate. It's not really chocolate, is it? (Laughs) White chocolate isn't chocolate, right? Isn't that the way it goes - [Eddie] I don't know,. it must have like some. - I don't know. I don't. think white chocolate is really a chocolate, but it's very, very good. Let me look at these pretty cookies. This is a real stiff batter, y'all. So don't think you've done anything wrong, cause you haven't, it's. just a stiff, stiff batter. Okay, alright, so we're gonna, we are gonna scoop these up, and you remember I've told. y'all, it's my suggestion that you make sure every. cookie is the same size, because if it's too much in one and not enough in the other, they won't cook at the same time. So this is a great way to make sure your cookies are the same size. And this is what I call my, my butter, my butter baller or fruit baller, whatever you want to call it. But this will keep me,. this will help keep me on the straight and narrow, you know making sure my cookies. are all the same size. You know, you're free to add, You're free to add more cherries, but I do recommend that. you use the candied, because they don't have. any liquid in them. That was missing a cherry. So I think I can get maybe one more layer down the center, but you know, Maraschino cherries, they are sitting in liquid. So it would change the base. of your cookie a little bit. So I would definitely. stick with the candied. And like I said, you can always add more if you want them, add more nuts, add more white chocolate. Oh my gosh, these look delicious. Add a little cherry to that one and the rest looks pretty. good, don't you think? So, I'm gonna put this in my oven, which I have preheated to um, I think it was 350 degrees, y'all. No, it's 375, so that's. what my oven is set at. And we are gonna bake. these for 11 to 13 minutes. So if a recipe says 11 to 13 minutes, always check your cookies or your cakes at the lowest choice. So I will be checking these. cookies at like 10 minutes. Cause you never know if your. oven is calibrated properly. So it's best that we. keep an eye on things. And of course you can. always go to the store and buy you an oven thermometer and see if it's correct. See if the temperature that you requested adds up to what registers. So that's a great way to find out y'all. So we will be back to check on. those cookies in 10 minutes. Y'all don't go anywhere. Okay, there are our. Christmas Cherry Chunkies, White Chocolate Chunkies, and. look how pretty they look. I think it's been a while. since I've made these, but I think next time I make them, I'll add more cherries to them, cause I was really like that pop that those cherries give. it and they're piping hot. So I've probably, Ooh. Maybe I can get them out to show y'all. Now the recipe calls for. 10 to 13 minutes at 375, I think the oven is. So this was at 10 minutes, y'all. You can see my oven cooks pretty good. So if you wanted to jazz up this cookie, you could buy drizzling. Eddie said he would like. drizzled chocolate on top with maybe some chopped peppermint bits, right Eddie? Is this the. cookie you're talking about? - [Eddie] No, but this one here would be good with white chocolate. - Yes, because it's got. white chocolate in it, right? - [Eddie] Yeah. - So put some white chocolate on top. My head is full of sugar. plumbs and cookies. I'm getting them all confused. We're far enough along into. the 12 days of Christmas, that I'm confused, but that's it, y'all. One of our favorites for the 12 days of Christmas cookies. Love and Blessed Dishes.";['postres']

You know, it's not one. of those most popular desserts, right now. But that's just because. maybe a lot of people hadn't tried a good one. So, I'm gonna share with you a recipe, that between my cousin,. Kelly Ort and myself have kinda put together. Now I have two cups of cooked rice. I started with one cup,. and that's gonna yield two. So, I'm gonna put my rice in there. And I just cooked this in regular water. Now I know some rice pudding recipes, will tell you to cook it in milk, which is fine but I didn't do that, because I'm puttin' something. in this rice pudding that you don't often see,. or if you ever see it. Which is sweetened, Carnation Milk. Sweetened condensed. And I'm gonna take some of this, and beat my egg with it. because this rice is still a tad bit warm, and I don't. want it to cook the egg. So I'm just gonna beat that up, and I'm gonna spoon some. of that warm rice in there. And this is called tempering. You're tempering that. egg, so it can slowly get warm without curdlin' or cookin'. So we're tempering that egg. And that warm rice is gonna. bring it up to temperature. So now I'm just gonna pour. this over the rest of the rice. And, seems like to me y'all, that my mother baked hers off. I'm just almost positive. So, I think I'm gonna do the. same thing with this one. I got out what I call. a small casserole dish, but you know what? I know what I'm gonna do. I know exactly what I'm gonna do. Alright, I'm gonna add. some more condensed milk. It may not, for this amount of rice, it may not take but like 1/2 a can. So really dependin' on how much rice you got. Alright, now I'm gonna add, oh gosh about 1/2 of a 1/2,. 'bout 1/4 cup of raisins. And the raisins really, to. me, just make this recipe. Yummy! Alright, so I'm going to put this in the microwave. and nuke it real quick like, to melt it, and I'm gonna. pour it into our rice pudding. (microwave closing) (buttons beeping) Alright, so I don't know that. I have a bakin' dish, y'all. - [Teresa] How about ramekins? - [Paula] Exactly what. I'm gonna do, Teresa. I'm gonna bake it in my ramekins. (dishes clanking) Oh my goodness, I was lookin', I was looking for those that Good Housekeeping gave me these. I know I have four of 'em. - [Teresa] Do you need me to come look- - [Paula] And this is perfect. But you might help me look (muffled). - [Eddie] There may be. some in the dish pantry. (microwave beeping) - [Paula] Alright here's another one. (dishes clanking) (both women talking in background) - [Teresa] Found 'em! Here we go. - [Paula] Thank ya! - [Teresa] We lost Eddie. - [Paula] Yep. - [Eddie] We took a. tour of the dish pantry. - (laughs) Oh, good! So I found these little cups and they are what, Good Housekeeping gave 'em to me. I was in New York, and I. was doin' the cover I think, to one of their magazines. And they gave me this as a gift. And it's, oh gosh, what is. the bread that you serve with prime rib? - [Teresa] French? - No. It's hollow in the center. My memory's gettin' so bad, y'all. Come on, Eddie, you know what it is. - [Eddie] Something pudding. - Read it off my tongue. (Eddie laughing) You see what I'm thinking? (laughs) - [Eddie] Isn't it something pudding? - Yeah. Yeah, it is. - [Teresa] I know what y'all. are talkin' about, but. - Anyway, (laughs) that's what. you do in these little cups. And i just thank you, Good Housekeeping. After all these years,. I still just love 'em. Just love 'em. So this is gonna be perfect 'cause that would be way too big. Alright, so I'm going to add, I'm gonna add a good bit of vanilla. Let's see.. - [Teresa] Yorkshire pudding. - Yorkshire pudding! That is Yorkshire pudding cups. Thank you, Teresa. - [Teresa] We can thank Google. (laughs) - (laughs) Oh you googled?. You cheated! (laughs) You know, I think, I think we've all kinda gotten lazy. Maybe that's why our memory's so bad, is 'cause we know we got a 'chine that we can turn to, and think for us. Alright, so I melted my butter. So I'm gonna pour that in. And look at this. Now when we bake this, that egg is gonna make it kinda custard-y. And now I'm gonna put in some cinnamon. And I'm usin' my tad, a. smidgen, a drop... (laughs) Let's see, a smidgen, a dash. Come on, Paula, a pinch. But I think I'm gonna use a tad. (laughs) A tad of cinnamon. This is that good cinnamon, right here. Corrie bought this for me. She said, ""You got to. use that good cinnamon."" - [Eddie] I can smell it. - Huh?. - [Eddie] I can smell it, just a little tad.. - I know it. Alright now, I'm gonna. do that with the nutmeg, 'cause nutmeg is strong, and a little'll go a long way. So that is it. You know what, I think I could use a few more raisins, don't you? Like I said, the raisins. are my favorite part. And you know what else. would be good in it? You wanna guess? - [Eddie] Nuts?|. - Nuts! (laughs) (Eddie laughing) Nuts, and I'm going back. for another tad. (laughs) Alright, let's see if I. can just shake out a tad. Just wasn't quite dark enough to suit me. So you can play around with. different rice recipes. Oh, and let me tell you what I did. I, a lot of times, I never. thought I'd ever say this, but I'm usin' Minute Rice, the kind that you put into boiling water. And I put some butter and some. salt in the boiling water, dropped that instant rice in there. And so I can pull a. meal together like that. So I thought, well today,. I've never made rice pudding usin' a quick rice. So we're gonna try, and I hope it works. Alright, now what was I gonna do? Oh, I know. (laughs) I know, I know. (laughs) Dad gum it! I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take my non-stick (oil spraying) and just do a little bit in the cup. And now I'm gonna fill up each of those cups. See, that's gonna be a perfect. serving size, isn't it? And to me, that looks more appetizing than puttin' it in a. casserole dish, doesn't it? - [Teresa] Mm-hmm. Great way for serving, too. - [Paula] I know! - [Teresa] But you can. only invite four people. - [Paula] I know it, I. wish Good Housekeeping would (laughs) give me four more. (laughs) Water's in the way. - [Eddie] I think that's. about it. I mean-- - [Paula] Yeah, see like I. said, that wouldn't have, that a been so thin. And we want it nice and thick. So we have to dig deep for it. Perfect! Alright, now the last thing I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sprinkle some turinado sugar on it. And turinado sugar, the molasses has been extracted from sugar cane. And then it thickens while it's evaporatin'. It'll get thicker and thicker. And then, they put it in a turbine. They spin it in a turbine. And that's how it got it's. name, turbinado sugar. So it's big-grained sugar. It's the color of brown sugar. But this is wonderful. on top of, like cookies. - [Teresa] Creme brulee.. - [Paula] Creme brulee, yeah. To torch that, it would. be very, very good. So I'm just gonna sprinkle. a little of that on top. Do you think we've got enough? (laughs) - [Teresa] With you, never. - Nev...Oh! Gosh, I almost did it. Made me nervous thinkin' I almost didn't have enough. (laughs) Alright, so I'm gonna put. this in the oven, y'all. Maybe 325, and I'm gonna let it cook until it's thickened and kinda set. And it's gonna be delicious. And it's gonna bring back memories like you never saw. Okay? Maybe 20 minutes? Alright y'all, it's time. to check our rice pudding. (oven door creaks) And let's see what it looks like. Oh my goodness. My goodness, my gracious! Winner, winner, chicken dinner! I think between Kelly and me, we got it. Look at these! Those are just beautiful, y'all. (pudding sizzling) Oh, I'm so proud. Now. what did we do? (laughs) (Eddie laughs) I want y'all to get it straight. Where'd that recipe go? - [Teresa] You always have it. (pudding sizzling) What did we do with it? - [Paula] I don't know. Where'd that little bowl of honey go? - [Teresa] It's right over there. I was tryin' to get it- - [Paula] Oh, okay, yeah. - [Teresa] I don't... - [Paula] Oh, it goes there. What did I do with it, y'all? I wanna make sure that you get exactly, exactly right measurements in this. So anyway, we'll put a link. I'll find it, and we'll put a link and I'll make sure y'all have. the perfect measurements, because this is just incredible lookin'. It's just what I was lookin' for. And it will- - [Eddie] Slide it under there. - [Teresa] Yeah, that's the- - This will take the skin. straight off of your mouth. Doesn't that look delicious? Eddie was just tellin' me that his mama used to make rice pudding a lot. And she would put it in. fancy little goblets. And Eddie would say, ""Oh,. Grandma's comin' to dinner. And we're gonna have rice puddin' in the purty glasses."" (laughs) - [Teresa] She refrigerated. hers, though, right? - [Eddie] Yes.. - Yes. You can eat this hot or cold. But you know, I'm a kind of a hot girl. (dog barking). - [Teresa] Yes you are. - Alright, what's goin' on? (dog barking and scampering) Who is it? - [Bobby] Bobby.. - Oh, yay! - [Eddie] It's Bobby. - Bobby's come in to help me, y'all. 'Cause I'm gonna be doin'. about six little shows today, so I asked him if he'd come help me. - Come on, you just said you need help, there's so much you don't know? - There so much I don't-. - That's what it is. - Bobby, do you ever remember. me makin' rice pudding? - Oh my, God, yeah. Hi, Teresa. (laughs). - [Teresa] Hey. - Well, I just... - Did you just make some? Did this just come out of the oven? - Oh, it's hot, son, yes. - Smells great. - Mm, taste it. - (laughs) Well, you. just told me it was hot. (Eddie, Teresa laughing) What kinda tricks are you playin', Pearl? Ooh, don't touch it! Taste it. (laughs) - Yeah, taste that, but don't touch that. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm! I might not should've gone back with that other little dash of cinnamon. But it's delicious, y'all. - Mm.. - Isn't that yummy? - So great. - You wanna take that home. to your babies for dessert? - It probably wouldn't. make it to my babies. (Paula and Teresa laughing) But it's so good. It tastes like, it tastes like a my, it tastes like oatmeal to me. - It does!. - It tastes like an oatmeal casserole, a very delicious, delectable, sweet and cinnamon-y oatmeal casserole. That's what my oatmeal tastes like. - It does, it does. - Tastes like you made. a big bowl of oatmeal and baked it in the oven. Hey dogs! - Yes, please speak to 'em. ♪ La la la la, la la la, la ♪ Some people were askin' Eddie about our dogs.. (dogs barking) They hear 'em all of time, but they don't- - I gotta wash my hands.. - Okay. Alright, this is Gus, the big white one. And he, Gus... Come here, Gus! (water running) And Gus is the biggest baby. (laughs) He is the biggest scaredy. cat you've ever seen. Thunder makes him go into pee-pee mode. - [Bobby] Well that's so many dogs. - [Paula] Yes. Max?. - [Bobby] Most dogs. - This is Max. Max is the trouble maker. He goes into my bedroom. If Pumpkin, the cat has slept with me, and the door gets left. open and Max goes in there, he pees on my pillow, tryin' to cover up the scent of Pumpkin. - [Bobby] No secrets here. - [Paula] He's bad, he's just bad. And this is the oldest one in the group, and that's little Lou Lou! Little Lou Lou. And she is so sweet. - [Bobby] Lou Lou is a.... - [Paula] But... But? What do you mean but- - She's an instigator, Bobby. (Bobby laughing) She will get Gus to get riled up, and both. of 'em jump on little Max. And one's eatin' his butt,. and one's eatin' his face. (laughs) And he doesn't. know which way to turn. So, that's- - [Bobby] There you have it. (laughs) - And it's funny. It's like children. They all got a different personality. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Oh! That rice pudding (mumbling) finally cooled off. - Huh? - Finally cooled off. (Bobby speaking gibberish) (Eddie and Bobby laughing) That is some good stuff.. - It is. - [Paula] I am so happy. that I wouldn't give up. - [Bobby] Well, it looks. like I got here just in time. - [Paula] Yeah. - To be a testing dummy.. - Yes. Taste it, dummy.. - Are we gonna cook? - Taste it, dummy.. - I did. - Yeah! (laughs). - It's great. Okay, bye, everybody. - I'm so glad Bobby got here.. - Me, too. - 'Cause I'm gonna put him to work. - Mm, so good!. - Love and best dishes!

JjOJtoZk_LY.json;"- Whoa! (chuckles) 12 days of Christmas cookies, y'all! I think this recipe is gonna. be a huge hit with y'all. 'Cause guess what? You. don't have to bake 'em. Which, you know, that's a bonus. And this recipe was sent in to me from Tammy Dubrula, from. Harpers Ferry, West Virginia Beautiful part of our. United States, y'all. And she said, ""Hi Paula.. Hope you'll try these. They are delicious. And. they're so easy to make."" Yay, cornflake balls. So, what you say, let's get starting. The quicker we get 'em made,. the quicker they cool 'em the quicker we can eat them. Like I said, there is no baking. There is a little. melting of stuff, though. And we are gonna start by. melting our white sugar, along with a cup of white Karo syrup, which I used to love as a child. on my pancakes and waffles. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Okay, so we're gonna just heat. this up on top of the stove until all the sugar is dissolved. All right. Tammy tells us to. put this over like medium heat and bring it to a boil, and make sure your sugar is dissolved. So the next thing we're gonna do, is we're gonna add a 12-ounce. jar of peanut butter to this. But, we're gonna take it off the heat, to let that melt. So, here we go. I think I want a harder utensil. (utensils rustling) I love this thing right here. Didn't somebody send me this? - [Eddie] Yes.. - Oh my gosh. - [Eddie] Peanut butter person. - Thank you, thank you,. thank you. I love it. Huh? - [Eddie] The buttery. - Oh yes! The butter girl! Well, I love it. See, that reached all the way. down in there to the bottom. Got it good. So we have a cookie that's easy. Healthy. Protein. I mean, what more can. we ask for in a cookie? You don't have to bake. it. That is the bonus. So we're just gonna stir this,. per Tammy's instructions. Good to the last drop. I wish one of the grandchildren were here. They could have fun licking that utensil. All right, so I'm just gonna stir this. Let that peanut butter. melt, all in our sugar and our white Karo syrup. And while our poonup butter. (laughs) Teresa and I both are having. trouble using our words today. - [Teresa] Yes. It's. not been a good thing. - I don't know. Is it our teeth, or - - [Teresa] I don't know.. - Our brain. - [Teresa] I'm a little worried.. Yet again. (Paula laughing) - Okay, that's melting pretty good. So while that finishes. its melting process, I'm gonna put in four. cups of cornflake cereal. And this is not sweetened. And I'm gonna add one. cup. This is a little shy. So I'm gonna ask y'all's. patience just for a minute. 'Cause I'm gonna look and see. if I have some more coconut. Okay. I found some, y'all. Quite often, when I use coconut, I don't ever use the full bag. So I just tied it up real good. Stick it in my freezer, and it's ready and waiting on me when I need it. So, gonna mix these together. I'll check on our stuff, our good stuff. And it is all melted. So Tammy tells us to just pour this over our cereal and our coconut mixture. This just making me smile.. I can't help it. (laughs) What a bonus. I mean, this is one of those cookies that would be great to. do with the children or grandchildren, you know? I mean, you don't have to worry. about them getting burned. And of course they love to get. their hands all in the stuff. All right. So, I don't. know how hot that is, so I'm gonna do it like this first. (cereal crunching) (Paula laughing) Tammy, girl, thank you. Thank you, Tammy, from West Virginia. Mm. Mm. Wanna dig deep and bring. it up and around and down. Oh, my granny's. (Paula laughing) Yum. Mm! Y'all hear me crunching? Can you hear the crunch? - [Teresa] Crunch, crunch, crunch. - I love it. She doesn't say anything. about mixing till cool, or anything like that. She just says, mix thoroughly. And then form them into. walnut-sized balls. I'm thinking that I'm gonna. need to do this to my hands 'cause I could wind up eating. more than, (Paula laughs) more than I'm supposed to. Mm. Mm mm mmm. Is that the size of your walnuts, Tammy? Sometimes, mine be pretty big. No, Eddie? You say ""no""?. - [Eddie] No, that's - - Is it bigger than a walnut? - [Eddie] I think so.. - [Teresa] Yes. - [Eddie] That's bigger than a golf ball. That's bigger than - - [Teresa] I would say golf ball. - Okay. (Paula laughs) Tammy, I love this cookie, mainly 'cause you didn't have to bake it. All you had to do was melt your sugar and your white Karo syrup. and your peanut butter. And that was it. Look, I. put these on a platter, so it looks like Santa Claus's beard. Ain't that cute? And I guess we could, let's see if I can find some good ones. And do for his eyes. No, when you take away his eyes, it looks different, doesn't it? Well, I tell you what, Tammy. While I was dipping these up, I got a little bit on my hand, so I had to get it off. (Paula laughs) Cheers. So good!";['postres']
jLLOMEC2wQg.json;"- Y'all with me, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - Okay. I am fixing to make, one of my favorite things. in the whole entire world. And um, that is a coconut cream pie. It's not gonna be like a regular pie on a pie shelf. You know, to me, homemade pies are almost a thing of the past now because they're tedious,. the meringue weeps and you know, just a lot of things, but there is nothing in the world better than a homemade chocolate meringue, lemon, ah, pecan, oh, my gosh. There's nothing better. than a homemade pie, ever, and a cup of coffee. - [Eddie] And a Swiss, swiss meringue will make you want that and only that. - Oh like the chocolate, Swiss meringue pie?. - Swiss meringue topping. - Oh, the topping, yeah. (laughing) Oh, Oh, Oh, you're talking about, yeah. The one that- - That you whip up,. - Yeah That, yeah, over boiling water. - Yes. - Oh the Swiss meringue is incredible. It's like the beginning. of a homemade divinity. - Yeah - And there ain't nothing like it, but this one is not going. to have Swiss meringue. - Nope. - No, it's going to have. a coconut whipped cream because this is going. to be one of those pies that you have to keep refrigerated, if there's any leftover. But I want to share with y'all, this is on the news stands right now, cooking with Paula Deen magazine. You can find this, on the newsstand quite often in your grocery stores. And if you don't see it,. ask if they would carry, start carrying this magazine, that's one sure way to get. it in your neighborhood. If it's not there, but here we're going to. make our coconut cream pie, which makes me so happy. We're going to make it. in a 13 by 9 by 2 pan. So, if you want to make me happy. when you're sharing a recipe and it calls for a 13 by 9 pan, this girls all in, because it just makes things so easy. So I hope y'all will pick. up a magazine, but you know, you'll be able to find this recipe online, but it's just out of this world. So we're going to start. by making our crust and, let's see how much, how much, we're using one cup,. plus two tablespoons of all purpose flour. And we are using a teaspoon of kosher salt. We're using one teaspoon of sugar. Okay. We're using a half a cup. of cold unsalted butter, and we've got a fourth of a. cup of cold, cold buttermilk. So we've got all of our dry ingredients, in our bowl, and I've cubed up our butter. So I'm going to drop in the end and it's, it's cold too y'all. Now you can use two forks, which is what I'm going to do, because I threw my pastry cutter, I threw it in the trash. because it got where it hurt my hands, cause a little handle would move. So I hadn't replaced it, so I'm just going to use. these old timey forks, the way they used to do it. And I'm just going to cut. all that in to our pie crust and into our flour. And then I'm going to pat it out, in, into a rectangle shape. I think I'm going to do this, I think I'm going to do. it with a knife instead. Oh, and we go put it in a refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes and you goin' to want this to look like, kinda like a coarse corn meal. And if you don't have a pastry cutter, it might take a few minutes. But that's alright. Okay. That's a fourth of a cup of buttermilk, and I wound up using my hands to cut that butter into the flour, and I told Eddie, I said, ""God, didn't give us these hands and arms just so they'd look good in a shirt"". He gave us two of them, because they are the. best tools in the world. So I think it could use. just maybe a little bit more buttermilk, so you know what I'm gonna do? I'm just going to borrow a little of the cold milk. I don't want to get it, I don't want to get it too wet. (bowl scraping) It looks like it's starting to, try form my little, dough. So, you know, you'll just have to judge, make a judgment call if you. need a little extra buttermilk. So I think that's going. to do nicely. All right. So now I'm gonna, see if I can encourage. it to come together. The warmth of your hands makes it much more workable, the heat from our hands, and this looks good, I'm glad. I added a little bit more, of our milk. And we don't want to handle. this too much because, it might make our dough tough, and we don't want tough dough. All right, so I'm gonna I'm gonna put a little flour down and I'm going to press this out into a rectangle shape, just to kind of do this and. then I'm going to transfer it, and we'll transfer it to a cookie sheet over here I've got a cookie. sheet with parchment paper and remember while you're rolling it out, you wanna kind of keep it in the shape of that pan, like that (parchment paper rustles) So I'm going to transfer this over to my parchment paper. I hope I didn't wait too late to do this. I didn't, it's perfect. Probably should have started out, you know on the parchment paper. I think this is one reason why pies are becoming extinct, because they are, they're work, they, they are work, But it's so worth it. So I'm going to cover this with a cloth, I'm going to put it in the. refrigerator and I'm going to let it sit for a minimum of 30 minutes. (spraying from can). Okey dokey It's been 30 minutes or a little more give or take. I'm just going to kind. of very, very gently, but not do gently, to get it loose from the paper. Can you pull that?. - There you go - Okay, and we'll need to bring it down. just a little bit, perfect. So we're just going to press this, in the bottom and up. the sides a little bit, whatever we, just like that, and this doesn't have to be. pretty like you would think a pie crust, you know, would have to be, cause a good chance it. might not even be shown, but see to me, that's fine right. there, that's like perfect. And I'm just going to. come in here over here, and smish that out a little bit. Now while we are waiting for our pie crust to to chill, Eddie and I started looking. for our, pie weights. You know, they looked like. maybe little white beans, dried beans, well, we couldn't find them. So I just went into the pantry and got some dried peas, it doesn't matter, navy. beans, white beans. black-eyed peas, just anything. that will serve as a weight. Okay, this is perfect. Perfect, perfect. Okay, so what we're gonna do now, is we're gonna lay down. our parchment paper and ah, you pour your pie weights on at this time, but we don't have them. So I'm not going to worry about it, I'm just gonna, pour our split peas out and that'll weight down. the parchment paper. So it'll stay on, and we're gonna bake this for, we're gonna bake it for about. 20 minutes and then I'm going to very, very carefully, take the parchment paper out and let it cook for about 8 more minutes. So in the oven it goes,. beautiful pie crust. While our pie crust is baking, I'm going to get our fillings started. And I have my sugar, cornstarch, which is going. to be our thickening agent for this. And, about three quarters, no, about a fourth of a teaspoon of salt. Doesn't take a whole bunch,. but just a little bit. All right, so I'm just gonna, swish my, whisk just around in there. and it's almost kind of like sifting it, so there we go. Now we're slowly gonna add, coconut milk and regular milk or it, yeah, is it ah - [Eddie] - Yeah its. unsweetened coconut milk. - Yeah, its, two cups of, two cups of canned coconut unsweetened coconut, and. then two cups of, ah, - [Eddie] Whole milk. - Yeah, I'm trying to see, oh yeah, there, I see it. I couldn't see it. Okay so we, we don't want to. dump that all in at one time, we want to kind of slowly add it. So it won't clump and lump on us. All right, the next thing. we're going to do is, I'm going to beat up our eggs. (electric whisk working) I'm going to have those. at room temperature. Okay, and I'm gonna add this, to our liquids. Take my little whisk and, (bowl scrapes) Those are some pretty yellow yolks. That's hard to say, the word joke wants to. come out instead of yolk. Okay. So we are going to cook this, (gas stove igniting) over medium heat for about 10 minutes. And we want to constantly stir that, because we don't want to. wind up with scrambled eggs. (whisk stirring) So we're good to go. And, we'll add our coconut and our vanilla flavoring, after it comes to fall and start to thicken. Okay, so I'm going to take it off to fire and I'm going to stir in two teaspoons of vanilla flavoring. And again, this is our homemade vanilla. It is so good. Oh, it just smells heavenly. But if I were to taste that finger, it sure wouldn't taste good. It would be like straight vodka, (whisk stirring) with vanilla flavoring. Okay. (whisk taps the bowl) All right, now I'm going to add about two and a fourth cups of ah, shredded coconut. Now you can actually add. as much as you- whoa, as much as you like. Just do it to suit your taste. It's funny, some people love coconut, and some people don't like it at all. I happened to love coconut. All right, this is a half a cup measuring. So, I'm going to do a. half a cup at a time, until I get it the way I want it. And we know we want at. least one cup of coconut. So that's one cup. Let's see what that looks like. (whisk stirring) Ooh, that looks pretty good. I think for my family's taste, I think I'm going to do, uh oh, Look I sat it on that hot fire. (laughing). on that hot iron. So, I'm going to do another, heap and half a cup. So that's probably, I would say, cause I. did them in big scoops, I'd say that's probably. about two cups of coconut. Wouldn't you say, Eddie? - [Eddie] - Yeah, yeah, it looks good. - Yes. I like more custard than I do the coconut. So I'm going to pour this into our crust. I probably, Eddie should've, should've rolled that crust. out a little bit more, but, I didn't, so, the custard is going to be. covering up all of the crust, that's what I was saying about. it, doesn't matter if it's pretty or not. But I should have rolled it a little bit, more so I'd have more goin' up the sides. (spatula tapping pan) This looks like creamed corn, doesn't it? (Eddie laughing) It looks just like my creamed corn that we had last night for supper, or real buttery mashed potatoes. All right, now I'm going to take, a piece of plastic wrap. - [Eddie] That's right here. - Plastic wrap is? - [Eddie] Yeah,. - Oh! - Thank you, Eddie, I had it covered up. I'm not fond about this wrap Eddie but, I'm gonna use it. Now we want to put this. on top of our filling, so it won't get that, that like, that skin on top of it, you know? And ah, cause it'll make it kinda, kinda hard. And I'm going to lightly spray this, so it will come off of our custard, because I am going to be. taking this off we are not eating plastic wrap, between our custard and our filling. Oh, the pan's hot. So you just want to press it down, just like that, so your plastic wrap is actually, touching, your custard. And like I said, it'll protect it from. that skin that gets on it. So, I'm gonna leave this. out for about 10 minutes, then I'm going to put it in a refrigerator and let it sit about 3 hours and then I'm going to come back in and show y'all what I use for the topping. And it's going to be a,. a coconut whipped topping that goes on it. (clapping) It's going to be good. So remember, I suggested that you put a thin, not thin layer because saran wrap is- you can only get it in one strength, but I said to press it into your, your custard. And I actually sprayed it, with some nonstick so you see by doing that, it didn't stick to any. of the custard part. So this looks, so good y'all. All right, now we're going. to top it with a coconut whipped, whipped cream. And I am going to start with a half a cup of unsweetened, coconut milk. And one and a half cups of heavy cream. And Eddie had put this bowl, in the freezer so it's nice and cold, so hopefully it will- all right come on up here. (giggles) I got you. Okay, so I'm going to beat it until kind of soft peaks form, and then I'm going to add the sugar too, and vanilla. (electric whisk working) Okay, let's see. Okay it's starting to form soft peaks, so, I'm gonna start adding the sugar. And let's see how much sugar it is, it's 6 tablespoons of sugar. Look how beautiful and thick that is. Now, if you really wanted to, you could make a meringue, and put on this, but I think, I think we're doing the right thing by using the heavy cream. Oh, I forgot the vanilla, Eddie that done it. All right, so, we put some grated coconut, in the air fryer and toasted it. We're just going to sprinkle that on top, and you can see how pretty, by toasting the coconut, how it shows up against the white of the heavy cream. What do you think Eddie? - [Eddie] It looks good. (laughing) - Doesn't that look good? - [Eddie] Yeah. I mean, hey, I mean it's a bigger pie. (laughing) - I know it will get many more. pieces out of this one Eddie then if we made it like, all right, there you go, let me get you a fork. And how about handing me the camera. - [Eddie] Oh, well, - And ah, 'cause you look much- (indistinct) Oh, here comes Peeks, he had a piece of cake at uh, (laughing) Okay, the proof's in the pudding they say. Hey Pee-Paw, - That's good. It's really good. - Eddie doesn't get real excited, and he's not real demonstrative, but I think, looking at his face and. knowing him like I do, I think he really does like it. - [Eddie] And I picked the recipe. - Huh? What? - And I picked the recipe. - And you picked the recipe, yes he did. - But ah, - [Peeks] How about cookies, any good? - No, no, they're not any good Pee-Paw. I want you to taste- you going to eat that Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah. (laughing) - Huh? - Yeah I'm eating the whole thing. All right, Peeks, get you. a spoon and bite into that coconut cream pie. You've never seen me make a. coconut cream pie in a pan, like that, have you? - Oh yeah. - This is the first time. I've ever made that for you. - Oh, that was my other girlfriend. (laughing) - You ain't got no girlfriends, there's no double dipping,. so get what you want. - Delicious, now I need a cookie to wash it down. (laughing) - Get you one big boy. - I'll have this little one. - Okay, those are monster cookies, for my monster mash man. Which do you like the best? - Gonna take me a while. (laughing) - You think the pies better? - I like the pie better than the cookies. - Well, I'm going to have to taste. - I like the pies better. - You think the pies better? - Now I gotta eat this big old cookie. - Now he's gotta eat that. big old cookie, he say. Oh, look at Eddie, he's. going to be a member of the clean plate club. Well, I hope y'all love this. recipe, and like I said, you'll have to check out, this magazine 13 by 9, that is on the shelf right now, and I'll give y'all one. more quick look at it, because if you're like me, 13 by 9s. - [Eddie] Yeah they have. some great casseroles. - Great casseroles in here, yes. There you go. 13 by 9 baking. So there you go. Love and best dishes y'all.";['postres']

K6R1P8RqDoI.json;"- Y'all, I'm so happy to be. able to share this recipe with y'all today. I made grand girls fresh. apple cake from Georgia. Oh gosh, a couple of weeks ago. And while I was talking about that, I was talking about the fig cake that I love to make. So people were writing in, ""Make that fig cake, ""make that fig cake."" So I am so happy to share. the recipe with you. And in all of my books, I. never had a fig cake recipe, but my dear brother did, he had a fig cake. And he mentions how much he. and I love this fig cake. So I'm so happy to share. this recipe with y'all. It's hard for me to. believe, but in August, my precious Bubba will be gone one year, on August the 15th. And I can't hardly believe it. In some ways it seems like yesterday because he stays so close in my mind and my heart, you know, like standing right next to me and you know, my brother,. he had some hard knocks when we had to bury our daddy. when he was 12 years old and he was 16 when we. had to bury our mother. And that was a terrible blow. for this precious little boy. And I just hurt so bad for him. And I hope he's enjoying the piece that he's getting right now, but this is in memory of. my brother, Bubba Hires. And I loved eaten with. Bubba, because you know, some people just eat to live where we kind of live to eat. I mean, we really enjoyed a meal together and this is one of our favorite cakes. So here we go. Bubba tells us to sift together, two cups of all purpose flour, a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of baking soda and one and a half cups of sugar. Now he says to sift, but I'll show you the way I kind of sift. This works. Just as well as sifting. Let's see, I'll just make. sure all those dry ingredients are all mixed up. And now we're going to. start with our eggs, we've got three eggs, that are going in there. And we're going to get that going. This really is the easy. cake to make y'all, it's kinda like a carrot cake where you, you almost don't even. have to have a mixer. Alright, then go slowly start adding, one cup of butter milk. There we go. One cup of buttermilk, and I don't care what kind. of cake you're making, your butter milk, just really, it really makes the cake (incoherent) You know, it's going to. be a Goddamn good cake. All right, now I'm going to add, now Bubba said to use one cup of oil, but I'm going to use just. a bit more than that, I'm probably going to use right. at a cup and a half of oil. Cause seems like the last time I made it, that's how much I used, so I'm going to stick with that. All right, now I'm going. to add my vanilla flavoring and my butter. It's a butter flavor extract. So I'm going to do like a teaspoon of that and a teaspoon of vanilla. Oh, my grandmother Hires. used to make up a cake and I don't know if I've ever. shared the recipe with y'all, what was it? It was... It was a butter... And the flavor was orange, oh, I'll have to think on that one, when I'm not thinking about anything else. And I'll see if I can. find the recipe somewhere. I can't remember the name of it. I know it had the word butter in it. All right, that looks nice. and well incorporated. All right now, the recipe calls. for a cup and three quarters of fig preserves, And these fig preserves. came off of our tree here. And I'm the only one here that. really likes fig preserves. So they last a long time when. I make a couple of batches, but you know what? We didn't hardly get it. We didn't get, how many did we get? Eight, we got eight, one or two of them. - [Eddie] The squirrels. - The squirrels like figs. - [Eddie] They like a bite. - They like one bite and. then they throw it away. And they're doing the same. thing with the pear tree, I hope we can get some pears. Do you like fig preserves great gran? Oh, my phone is mine too. All right, so I'm going to mix those up with the mixer and hoping that'll break those figs down, because. when I make a big figs, I don't mash them. I leave them whole cause and I leave the stem on, cause I like to be able. to pick it up by the stem and eat it along with my toast. Another thing that. Michael and I argue about is kinda like our shrimp in the eighties, Michael's tails off, I'm tails on. Fig preserves he goes for. stem off, I want it on. Although he did, I don't care what he wants because he really didn't need them enough. So I do them the way I like 'em. I need the child is going to be so good. All right, now I'm going to add a cup of pecans. And I'm going to bake. this in a tube pan y'all. I'm not going to bake it in my burnt pan because I want this cake. to have plenty of room. Because while this is baking, we are going to be making. a buttermilk topping. And we're going to pour. it all over this hotcake as soon as it comes out of the oven. So I want the cake to have. plenty of room to grow and then hold our topping too. All right, now I'm going. to spray my pan with, back in the day, I used to use a solid shortening and then dust it with flour. But today they have come up. with another convenient product and it has the flour and. the shortening in it. I don't like breathing it. I got it good enough. All right, so I've got our. oven preheating at 325, y'all. Look at this big chunks of fig. Yes. - [Eddie] And this rises. up pretty high, does it? - It rises up some, yeah, cause remember we put. the baking soda in it, so that's going to help it rise. - There we go. See one that easy. We really could have made this cake without even using a mixer. But for some reason it just. makes me feel better to, you know, have that mixer. So in the oven, 45 minutes, or until the cake pulls away from the pan. Now while that's baking, we can go ahead and make. the buttermilk topping, that we are going to. pour over that hotcake. Okay friends, the cake... It's fixing to go off, the timer's fixing to go off. So we're going to put together the topping that we're going to. pour over it real quick and that's going to be. one stick of butter. I want to show y'all something. This is what I've had to resort to, to tryna see. Okay, the Obama that is black. So it's hard to see in there. All right, we're gonna add, I think it was a cup and a. half of sugar, let's see, three fourths of a cup of sugar, a half a cup of buttermilk. What did I yell you, I knew it was going to go off. Let's see what it looks like. It looks beautiful. Eddie, can you come over. here and get a shot, look at that y'all. Look at that beautiful cake. And we'll take a knife. and I'm just gonna go around the edge, cause this topping, and then I'm going to put on it. I want it to, you know, be. able to get all in there. All right, we're going. to add one tablespoon, a white Cairo syrup, and if I'd have taken the. time to spread that teaspoon, it would've just rolled. right out of there, like melted butter. All right, and then. half a teaspoon of soda. So we're going to bring this to boil y'all and then we're going to. just pour it directly on to our hot cake. - Bubba's recipe didn't. call for any kind of spice, but you know, if you like the. taste of like a carrot cake or something like that with the cinnamon, you could always add like. cinnamon and cloves to this, and just give you another twist of flavor. All right. So that won't take, but a minute, I think we have to cook it, let's see how long did he tell us. Like three minutes. So this cake is beautiful. Ain't it Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. I remember being(mumbles) - Oh, it's so moist, just. collapses in your mouth. You know, Bubba was, he was really, you know, more, a couple of different hats with Bubba. And Bubba wore a couple. of different hats with me. I had to finish, I had to try to start. I had to try to finish what. mama and daddy had started because I was seven. years older than Bubba. So when our mother died, Bubba was 16. So, you know, I wore a mother hat and a. sister hat and a friend hat, but I felt very protective of Bubba. He was this close to my child, as it could be without him being my child. So, I mean, he's. constantly there, you know, in my head and I miss him so bad. I'm actually the only one. left from my immediate family, my mother, my daddy, my brother. And it just seems so strange to say that I don't have a brother. I don't have a brother anymore. And it just makes me real sad. And then it makes me very happy, thinking about all the. good food that we shared over the years, our mama, my. daddy, when we'd have steak, y'all mama would buy the sirloin. steak with the bone in it. And you know, she could give us four. servings, sometimes five. And Bubba and I would. fight over that bone, both bone mowers. And pull a little thing, in fact, I've got a picture Eddie. of me sitting there. I had my bonnet on, cause my hair was rolled, and Bubba was sitting there so happy, he was mowing a bone, and I was looking at him like, like a sister would, but I thought he was disgusting. eating all those bones, all though lots of times I won the fight cause I liked the good bone too. Okay, look at that Eddie, Wanna put you're finger on that Eddie? - [Eddie] I'll wait for the cake. - Well, I'll tell you what, this is good enough, I. could pull me up a couple of this stuff you only drank it. All right, so here we go. Just go pour that all over that cake. You know what, I think I might just do that Eddie. Poke some holes in it. Let it go down in there. Don't you think that'd be good. - [Eddie] I think we take. that with the Apple cake. - Oh yeah. Any cake that I baked that. has like a glaze on it, I'll poke it. So it can go down in there. Now we're gonna, we can't take the cake. out until it absorbs, that wonderful buttermilk glaze. Makes me suck my teeth. Oh my gracious. - So I'm going to stand up here and I'm going to kind of work this in until it's all gone into the cake and then I'll flip it over and show y'all what it looks like and. how easy it comes out. Johnny, my grandson, his mom didn't know if it was on what? - YouTube or Facebook. - YouTube or Facebook. All right, so y'all can see. the cake is still, you know, very hot, but almost all of the juice has all of that glazed look at that. - Wow. - Doesn't that look delicious? All right this is how we. going to get that cake out. And this is-- - That's a cool way. - Ain't that a cool way? And this is kind of when I. start praying the cake gods. It's so heavy John. No, it was so heavy. No, it was so heavy. - Oh, it looks so yummy. - Well doesn't it? Oh, I wanna cry. I wanna cry, cry, cry. This is real life y'all. Okay. It's so moist. - And so yummy. - And so yummy, but I'm. so sad because (mumbles) I have never had this happen, ever. Alright, so I'm going to try to, you know, it's so hot. - Wow. - I really rushed this John You know, trying to. - [Eddie] Why does the spin. have the little handles on it? - I don't know, I guess so I can grip it. - [Eddie] If you didn't. have, if it was flat-- - I really rushed this y'all it should have actually. hold a little bit more, but I was trying to quickly. show y'all what it look like. I hope yours will look better. But you know what it. will hit like a champ. John's won't play Lego's. I'm so upset. (mumbles) Look at this beautiful cake. - I feel like six, six,. six jumped on my cake too. So look at how pretty that cake is. - This looks yummy. - That was unbelievable how. heavy Eddie, that cake pan was, and you know, this cake pan, it's not level. - [Eddie] If it was. level level, it's like, it's not even a pound. - All right here, you wanna taste this? Yes. - Huh? (mumbles) - And you know what? I can't even move it because it's so hot. I can't even move it to get. it in the center of the pan. That's very appropriate sounds,. John, that you're making. - If you decide to make this, I would let it cool a bit longer, but I was anxious to show y'all. Loving best dishes y'all. I wanna cry. I just had to share with y'all, a taste test that Eddie is. doing on this beautiful cake. - It doesn't matter how that looks. I mean, it tastes absolutely wonderful. Ain't it Wonderful?";['postres']
k9px35f5Utw.json;"- Hey, y'all welcome to my kitchen. Paula's kitchen. I am real excited about. sharing this recipe with y'all today. I hope you've never had it, so you can have the fun with. it that I've had with it. I'm fixing to show y'all. how to make cheese fudge. It sounds crazy, I know. But it is so good. And I want to show y'all what I've got back here on the stove. The cheese is this. I know I'm not supposed to show brands, but it is what it is. And this is an eight ounce bar and that's what the recipe calls for. And it calls for, hey boys, y'all stop. Stop. Stop. They're fixin' to gang up on. little Max, poor little Max. We have two sticks of butter in here and an eight ounce block. of Velveeta cheese. We're just gonna melt these together. And the cheese takes a little longer than the butter, naturally. And you just need to. keep a close eye on this. I'm gonna turn it up a little bit. And then we're just gonna. wait for that cheese to melt. Okay, y'all it's all melted. It does take a few minutes to melt it. And like I said, you might could put the. cheese in there first, cause it takes a little bit. longer and let that melt. All right now to our cheese. We're gonna add our nuts. And our vanilla flavoring. And you know, I like, I. like my vanilla flavoring so I'm gonna do two cap fulls. And in this bowl over here, I'm gonna put in, let's. see how many ounces, anyway, this equals like two. boxes of confection sugar. It's wanna stick to the sides. Thank you, Eddie. Eddie's a mind reader. He knows what you want. 'for you ask for it. Two pounds of confectionate. sugar in the bowl. And I tell you to sift it, what'd I do with my whisk? Is it sitting up there. and I just can't see it? No, here it is. All right and it says to. sift your powdered sugar and your cocoa together, but actually, I just use my whisk and that's. so very close to sifting. See how that's mixing. it all together and-- - [Eddie] I bet this ends up being kind of like Swiss fudge, doesn't it? (laughing) - [Paula] Kinda. - [Eddie] I bet. I was skeptical at first. And I'm still a little skeptical. - [Paula] You're not. gonna believe it, Eddie. - [Theresa] You've never had cheese fudge? - [Eddie] Uh uh. - [Theresa] Oh my gosh. - [Paula] Well you know how long it's been since I made it? - [Theresa] Well I must. have had it 'cause I-- - [Paula] I think it was. before I ever met Michael. It's been a long time. Hey little Mike, you like fudge? - Yes ma'am. - [Paula] Do you like nuts? I can't remember. - No ma'am. - [Paula] You don't like nuts. Dadgumit, I wanted you to taste my fudge. - I don't know if I can. help you on that one. - Okay, so in that goes. and this is gonna be very, very, very, very thick. Gonna make sure I get every bit. (laughs) This recipe just makes me laugh. Just pure makes me laugh. (dogs barking) Hush, hush, hush. - [Theresa] Shush, come here, come here. - Hush. It's probably Henry. Our grandsons are staying with us, John and Henry, for a couple of days, while their parents are out of town. And Michael had to actually. go pick Henry up from school 'cause he had a stomachache. - [Theresa] I think he's playing hooky. - I think he might be taking advantage of Poppa and Ginny's (laughs) feelings. For lack of a better word. - [Theresa] That's what grandparents do. - [Paula] Listen, they know. (dogs barking) Hush. - [Theresa] Come here. - [Paula] I'm sure it's Henry, getting up out of the bed. and walking around, Theresa. All right, so when you make this y'all, you may want to make. sure you got a strong man around the house. Because it takes a while. to get all this blended. Look at that. - [Eddie] Sure does look good. (laughing) - Doesn't that look good? It is good. And I've had so much fun with this recipe, Eddie, over the years. Mike, would you do me a favor? Would you wash your hands and come stir my fudge, please? - [Mike] Yes ma'am. (laughing) - I've had so much fun with. it over the years, y'all. I remember the first time I made it, I lived at Turner's Creek. I didn't know who Michael Groover was, that's for sure. But, I took it to my neighbors and I said, ""Now I want you to. taste it while I'm here. I want you to taste it while I'm here, 'cause I want you to tell me what you think is in this fudge. How I made this fudge."" Well, nobody guessed it right, nobody. And when I told 'em, they just, you could have knocked. 'em over with a feather. They said, ""There is just no way that that can be fudge."" Thank you baby, my arm's about shot. - Getting a workout. - Y'all, this is Mike Pryor. He is a part of our team here. And a very important team member. - [Mike] Thank you ma'am. - [Paula] In case I. hadn't told you lately. - [Mike] All the time. - [Paula] So get in there. and stir it up good, baby. - [Mike] Okay. - [Paula] This arm's about. to fall off from stirring. - [Mike] I believe it. - [Paula] From stirring. the cheese and the butter and then stirring the fudge. There's Henry and Poppa. I knew, the dogs were just going crazy. And I just knew it was. y'all, up walking around. How you feeling, Henry? - [Henry] A little bit better. - [Paula] Good. Thank you, darling. - [Mike] Yes ma'am. - [Paula] I appreciate it. - [Mike] You tell me when it's good. - Okay, it's good, I think. I can finish it from there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - [Mike] You're welcome. - It's so nice to have a young. man around the house, y'all. All right, so I'm just gonna. go around that bowl now with a spatula. - [Michael] That's why you married me. - [Paula] Yes, that's why I married you. Where were you when I needed you? - [Michael] You have a young man-- - [Paula] Huh? - [Michael] You have a. young man around the house. - Young man, my. I'm telling you what, you. must not have a mirror in your bathroom. (laughs) Just 'cause he's nine years younger. You still an old man. All right, see how long it takes to, now what I would like to do, but I'm not gonna do it today. What I would like to do. is make another batch and make it peanut butter and put that on top of the chocolate so you'll have peanut. butter and chocolate. Michael, have I ever. made this cheese for you? I mean this fudge, for you? (laughs) Say. - [Michael] I think. once, about 20 years ago. - [Paula] Yeah, I mean. it's been a long time since I made it. Okay, and then I'm just, and like I said, I didn't grease this dish because it has two sticks of butter in it. I think that's enough to. keep it from sticking. And because of that butter. If the butter appears to come to the top, you can take a paper towel and pat it out. And if there's any excess. butter coming to the top. So make this and give. some to your neighbors or your friend and get them to tell you what's in this fudge. And I'll bet you a dollar to a donut, that nobody will say Velveeta cheese. And this doesn't take. but a second to cut it. I just put it in the refrigerator just for a minute, look at that. (slapping) Viola. We gonna let it chill and then we'll come back and taste it. I can't wait for Eddie to taste it. Probably not more than 10 or 15 minutes and it's gonna be so hard, but you know what Eddie, I just can't hardly wait. for you to taste it. So I'm gonna go ahead and, you're not opposed to a soft-- - [Eddie] Melted fudge? - Piece of fudge, are you? - [Eddie] Melted cheese fudge. - Yes, all right so taste it and tell me. - [Eddie] Yeah. - [Theresa] Can you taste the cheese? You cannot, can you? - No. - [Eddie] No. No. - [Theresa] You would never know. - So how good is it? - [Eddie] It's really good. - [Theresa] You'll be taking some to your room tonight, won't you? - [Eddie] Yeah, I mean it's-- - [Theresa] You'll be taking some home. I know you will. - [Eddie] It's just like fudge. - I know, it's incredible. No fail. No fail, no fooling, no fail. - [Henry] Am I allowed to have fudge? - [Eddie] Velveeta. (laughing) - Y'all have as much fun with this recipe as I've had with it over the years. I took a long break from. it but I'm glad to be back.";['postres']
KCeP4WUBrRo.json;- Hey, y'all. Jamie Dean here. I'm in Mama's kitchen. I'm making blueberry dumplings today. Blueberry dumplings. It's a dessert and we're gonna cook it. And it's gonna be off the chain. We're making dumplings. to drop into our boil. My mama makes cornbread drop dumplings and she does it in pot. liquor for Thanksgiving. Same thing, except we're. gonna drop dumplings into smoking hot, cooking,. black blueberries. So the first thing we gotta do. y'all is get our water going. So I got two cups of water. Get my stove turned on. I'm gonna add a cup of sugar and then I've got these. beautiful, fresh blueberries. I'm just gonna go ahead. and put all these in. And I want this to cook,. cook, cook, cook, cook. And we're gonna just let that go. That has to boil. We need that to be boiling. So let's move over here to our dumpings. This is a simple dumpling mix. that we're making using flour. I've got baking powder and some sugar. I'm also gonna add pinch of salt. Let's mix this in and then into this, I'm gonna cut some butter. Now, when you cut butter in, they make there's a beautiful pastry. tool that you can use but you gotta drawer full of 'em already. If you wanna save a few. bucks and just use a fork. And as we cut the butter into this flour, it's gonna get a little bit more crumbly, a little bit more smooth. This is kind of a boring part of baking, but if you like to bake, you've cut butter into. flour more than one time. So y'all gimme a second. Let me do this. We're gonna add a little. bit of milk to this, and make our dumplings. and that'll give us time to boil our blueberries up. Y'all stick around. Blueberry dumplings. Hot dog. Okay. Y'all I got our butter cut in. You see what that looks like? It's kind of a, a crumbly type deal. And now we got to make our dough. So we're gonna add the milk. And I'm gonna mix this up. And if you look into our. pot right next to here you can see we've got. our blueberries rolling. Now, this is much like the. peach cobbler that we make. This is like the, maybe the homemade. dumplings that you had when you were growing up. We're not gonna disturb these. Once they go in here, we're gonna cover 'em, and let them cook undisturbed. I've managed to grab the worst tool out of a professional kitchen in the whole world to mix this up. I'm gonna fight through it. It's hardheadedness prevails in the end. And if I just keep doing it, even though it's harder, it'll work. All right, here we go. Uh oh! Let me grab a teaspoon. Do you see how hard that water's boiling? By the teaspoon, I'm gonna drop these in. God. It smells wonderful. Now, once we get here, y'all do not stir. Cannot stir this. I'm gonna drop these in, and I'm gonna cover it. And it's gonna sit covered for 20 minutes. Hoowee! Y'all let me finish this up. Get myself together. In about 20 minutes, we eatin'''' blueberry dumplings. You ready? Get the ice cream. Y'all were here with. our blueberry dumplings. I've cooked them for 25 minutes. Didn't stir 'em. Didn't uncover it. Been patient. Clean up a little bit. Getting ready. Here we go. Mmm! Mmm! Blueberry dumplings. Who ever in a million. years would've guessed. And so now I've got my little bowl here loaded up with my ice cream. It's like a chicken pot pie, almost. Look at that. Good gracious. Blueberry dumplings. Yeah! Woo! And look. It's a new thing Theresa found. This is real heavy whipping cream All ready in a container. Ready to go. Look how pretty that is! That is blueberry dumplings, y'all. It's easy to make. Let me see. Mmmhmm. Easy to eat, too. Hey, I'm Jamie Dean, and this is Good Food. I'll see y'all around the kitchen.;['postres']

Doesn't it? - Yes ma'am. okay. Whoa whoa (grandma laugh) - let go. - It's heavy. Okay. You can let go now. That's right. Get you a little lick. And then we're going to just. take our specs for silly, like this and spread it evenly. So tomorrow when you go to school and you have another day. of not learning anything (grandma laughing) maybe you can teach. your friends something. What can you teach them? - I don't know - This - I can't go into school and be like this. - You can, you can, but you can tell him about it. You can share, you can share with what you've done. Right? Lily, What are you barking at - Vicious? - Shall i - I know it, she sounds like a bad, big, bad dog. Doesn't she? Oh my goodness. You know what? This kind. of reminds me of Carry. Remember that million dollar pie that we used to make a - million dollar pot. - You need to pay the million dollars for a piece out it too. Okay. So now we are going to, I'm going to kind of clean. up the sides where we got a little rambunctious - me. - Oh no, I won't do it again. Cleaning - all right smell Butterfingers. (grandma laugh) Are they tweaked? Hopefully they're Butterfingers. I mean tweets. - Okay. So now we've gotten to. spread this chocolate over your feeling. Okay. Kind of. Yeah. Kind of drizzle it. Hey, this is going to be so good. All right. Now this is when. we have to take up a thing. The spatular people always making fun of the way I say spatular, but it's. spatular - My friend at school called him. Piano, piano - Piano (grandma laughing) - Monday morning. We talk about. our weekends and she's like, I went to my friend's birthday. party and smack a piano and we all started laughing and. I was about to say, and then, and then I was like, oh, piano - Did that embarrass her? - Probably because every. single kid in the class laughing. - So you taught somebody. something that they'd be - Yeah don't say piano - Joking about that word. He said in the car that. we laughed about so loud. - Oh my gosh. You've. said some funny words. So when you're saying. - Huh. - Huh? - Me, you and daddy were in the truck. - Oh, I saw that thing on. the map and I was like, oh, - You're talking about like, - oh yeah, so I'll go see one of. that on my dad's truck. And I want to say, remove the triangle. And I'm like remove the triangle from Buddha. - Like Bermuda shorts. All right I got one more thing to do Sally. And this is our garner - Are this butterfingers - Butterfingers. And all right, hold on. You want tweaks? Well,. I don't have any tweaks. All right. So Guinea is going to do this, but keep your little digits away from it. Cause - I can cut it right. No, not, not with this knife. This is a serious knife. So we just don't course cut these up. So this is going to be our garnish. So from here on that, your job is eat it. - That is my job always - All right. Now we're going to spread. We're going to sprinkle this on top. - Let me get some, - we'll get you some,. get in the, get you soon. And he's great. Great is here. As I told John earlier,. and he asked if great great in our video, so y'all want to hear a funny story. So George, my cousin, George Piggy's oldest son brought her, brought her over here from Albini's for her doctor's appointment - said Albany, Georgia, - Albany, Georgia, and got out of the car here. You know, it's like a four hour drive.. Like I have a car here. So this was Saturday. It was Saturday. So, and I don't have a car. And, and - notice when - they realize it, George did not put great. grapes suitcase in the car. So now this is Monday and. this happened on Saturday. - Saturday So we are doing some hand washing. (grandma laughing) So her suitcase, George got in his car. the next morning early, went back to Albany, got her suitcase, took it to ups and it. should arrive tomorrow. - Why not? Delightful thing. - Its a good thing She. likes what she's got home. I'm just so thankful she had her meds. - Yes. I had two things, my pocket book with my wallet in it and love the bag. So that was good. - So a long story short. So the reason, well we'll dip it up. The reason that that's it maybe later because Guinea doesn't, I mean, great, great. Doesn't have any makeup or clothes. All right. So just neatly cut a little bite. Without messing it up Ooh, you got the goods. Okay. Bon Appetite. No double dipping (grandma laughing) my copper much to the shelf.

L68bx9gu5Wk.json;- Hey friends. It is so stinking hot here in Savannah. So hot. But you know what? I heard that there's a heat. wave across the country that like the Midwest is. breaking records for heat. You know I'm so thankful. that Bobby lives on the water and with us living here. in his guest house, we're on the water also and. that creates a little breeze. So I'm ever so thankful for that. But having said that, it is summertime, and all of the wonderful. delicious fruits are coming in. And the triplets adore, adore fruit. I've got mango, I've got honeydew, kiwi, blackberries, strawberries,. and blueberries. Now I was given. instructions to teach y'all, if you don't know how, to cut a mango. Because you know, it's. got that huge seed in it. So I called in the expert. this morning, Claudia, because her children adore. mangoes, especially Olivia. So I said I really need an expert today on helping me teach folks how. to properly slice a mango. So she is gonna be here in a little while, she couldn't come right then. But so while I'm waiting on her, I'm gonna make a sweet, creamy custard for dipping our fruit. in while we're waiting on Claud to get here. And all I need for that. is milk, eggs, and sugar. So it's really gonna be like, almost like a vanilla. pudding to dip it in. I'm gonna start with a. cup and a half of milk. And I think if I remember correctly, like a half a cup of. sugar, let me check, y'all. I don't want to, 2/3, tell you wrong. Yes, 2/3 of a cup of sugar. And we are gonna heat this up. Now we don't want it to boil. We never want this to boil. And you need to stir it. pretty like, almost always. All right, I've got two, four,. six eggs here, six yolks. And I'm gonna (fork. clinking) beat those up. And then we're gonna temper our yolks with our hot milk and sugar mixture. And then we're gonna be adding our vanilla and a little butter. And naturally we have to let this cool. And I always serve the. dressing on the side, because some of you may want. it and some of you may not. So you can serve yourself on that. Now this is probably gonna. take it about 10 minutes. I've got it on a low temperature, so it'll take about 10 minutes probably, for this to this heat up and then we'll be ready. to temper our egg yolks. Okay, our sugar has dissolved. So now we're just gonna add a little bit and you see, it's not boiling. We don't want it to boil. So we're gonna slowly. add the hot to the yolks. Otherwise, if you just poured. the yolks right in there, they could curdle, and it'd. be like scrambled eggs. So you gonna add a little bit more, and just beat them each time. you add a little of your hot. Okay, so those are nice and warm now. So we're gonna pour it into. our milk and sugar mixture, just like that. Anytime you're making a cream. pie or anything like that, that's the way you'll want to. add your eggs to the recipe. Like I said, you can't. just put 'em in there, or you might get scrambled. eggs in your custard. So now we're gonna cook this until it begins to thicken some. Okay y'all, it took about 10 minutes. It's slightly thickened and it. coats the back of the spoon. When it coats the back of your spoon, then you know it's ready. So we're gonna add our butter and about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. And we're gonna stir that together. And then we gonna let it cool. And by the time this cools, Claudia should be. walking in the back door, to teach us how to properly cut a mango. So I got a kick out of. when Ms. Theresa told me that she wanted an expert to show y'all how to slice, peel, and slice a mango. Well I hate to tell you,. but I'm not the expert. And I'll tell you why. Because I know it's got. a huge seed in the center and they're expensive, they can be pricey. They're not right now. 'cause there in season. They're like a buck apiece. at the grocery store now. So I never would buy a mango. But I've seen Claud peel and. de-pit a mango so many times, because Olivia loves a mango. - Mm-hmm. - So- - Here's the expert. - I laughed, yes.. - The mango expert. - So the expert is my. daughter-in-law, Claud. Do they grow these in your home country? - Yes.. - Okay. - So at my grandma's house,. they had huge mango tree and- - Really?. - Yes, it was crazy. And they're the best mangoes. All these are usually imported. from, like, Mexico, I feel. - Yeah, yeah. - But in Latin America and South. America it's, it's amazing. And I remember at the school too, and when the trees would be packed. Like they'll let the. kids bring mango, yeah. - Oh, that's great. Well, I had a feeling the. way I've seen you handle 'em. (Claudia laughing) That they must be native. to where you grew up. - Yes, yes, and these. remind me of my daddy. My daddy loves mangoes. - Does he?. - He does. - All right, now I've picked. - And they're delicious, I love them too.. - I picked out a couple of knives, and I hope one of 'em. is sharp enough for you. - Well, we're gonna see-. - So let me know. And if it's not-. - We'll get another. - Now do you start off by washing them? - Yeah, so I don't, I'm no. expert, but I'll do my best. - All right, and I've got, compared to me, you're an expert. - Okay, let's put it that way. but, no expert.. - There's different standards. - Well, now, I didn't used to. wash my fruit that had peels, but Bobby told me a crazy. story that he read online. I think I told you that, too. Of somebody that ate an. avocado without washing it, like cut it, and they ate it. And there was like some. bacteria on the skin, and then that person died. - So after that I wash everything. - I've never heard that story, and I've never washed an avocado. - Wash them, wash them. I'll even wash my lemons now.. - Never. - And I wash them with. like water and vinegar, so. - Yes.. - But this will do. - And you've got a machine that's like, you can put your fruits and. your veggies to sterilize them. - To sterilize everything, yeah. So okay. - All right, so first of. all, we've got 'em washed. Now I would like for you to. tell us how to select a mango. - Oh. - I don't know when they're ripe. - Well, it's funny because. sometimes you think like this is really red. and you'll feel like, because it's really red, it's ready, but it's all by feel. So it's like a lemon, you know? You want it to be a little. bit squishy, squishy, squidgy. - Yeah, this one's not squishy. - It's not very squishy, but it's fine. - No, let me check this one.. It's like an avocado, too, like a lemon or an avocado. - Like an avocado, yes. I know how to select a avocado. - So it's about the same.. - That's much the same way. - Yeah, and usually like I'll get, if I get three for the week for Oli, I'll get one that is harder, to give it time like an avocado.. - Right, right. - Like a banana. - Yes. - And remind me, before you leave today, I've got all that fruit. that I wanna give you that I'm afraid is gonna go to waste. - Yeah. - It won't go to waste in my house. So this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna cut and this. is all gonna be by feel, because we don't know. where the pit is, right? So you're just gonna cut, I'm gonna say like. third, like a third way. - [Paula] A third of the way. - [Claudia] Yeah. - [Paula] You gonna try to. get a solid piece of meat. - [Claudia] Yes, but. see, I can feel the pit. - [Paula] You can? - [Claudia] No, I cannot. - [Paula] You cannot. (Claudia laughing) - [Claudia] It's a mango that is hard. That's the pit. - [Paula] Okay yes, yes. - [Claudia] So you're gonna. try to do that with every side. But again, it's got, the softer the mango is the easier it is, because you'll feel the hard. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Claudia] Like I can. feel that thing there, so let's go this way. (knife cutting) So maybe this way. I'm gonna have to go a little sideways, but it's fine. Yeah, this mango is not quite ready. - It's not quite a mango, is it? - No, you wanna go as close. to the pit as you can. - [Paula] As you can. - [Claudia] I could have gone closer here. - [Paula] Yes. - [Claudia] Of course the. edges are gonna be smaller. You're gonna have two. big pieces in one small. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Claudia] So the trick is gonna be, kind of like what you. may do with an avocado, is that you're gonna do squares. - [Paula] Just like an avocado. - [Claudia] Yes. So you don't go all the way. All the way through. - [Paula] And then do you need. a spoon to scoop them out? - [Claudia] No, well this one's hard, but the fun part now is. that you will do, like this. Ta-dah! - [Paula] It's like that pop it. - Yes, and then you can eat it. Like this, like if we were. gonna eat it straight. You can just eat it like this. This one. - That's great. - [Claudia] It can come. out with your hands. - [Paula] But now, Oli. doesn't eat it that way. - [Claudia] Well, she licks the,- - [Paula] Does she? - [Claudia] This usually comes out easier. But I wash my hands. - [Paula] 'Cause I always. see them in chunks. - [Claudia] Yeah, I washed. my hands before I came, so people are not saying. I didn't wash my hands. (Claudia laughing) Always wash your hands. and then you just bob. Again, it should be, you know. This one is, I mean, I'm sure it's delicious, but- - [Paula] It is, it's delicious. I just tasted it.. - [Claudia] It could have sat a couple of days. Or you could also, if you want,. you could also wrap it up. - [Paula] Please don't cut yourself. - [Claudia] Yeah, you could also that. But I feel like when you. do it with your hands, it comes out more closer to the skin. - [Paula] Well that is delicious. - [Claudia] Yes, and then- - [Paula] If I was here. by myself or maybe, didn't have to be by myself.. - And then you eat this. - I would eat this. - Then you eat that. Yeah,. that's what I usually do. - Mm, you do? - Yeah, and I give that to. Oli and she'll eat that. And then with this little guy,. I'll just do like a strip, if you wanna get this one. Okay, and then what you do with this, you just work around the you know, so all I do is just I just try to. Let me move this at least, so. I just try to get all these little- - [Paula] As much of the meat you can. - [Claudia] Meat as you can, yeah. (knife cutting) - [Paula] See that just. seems like such a waste. It's such a big seed. - [Claudia] Yeah, and I just, well, I mean you can suck this. - [Paula] Oh, thank you. So no part goes to waste. and then this you just cut. - [Paula] I think there's. some more you can cut there. - Yeah probably, smaller.. - Can you get that closer? - [Claudia] Or you can eat it. - [Paula] 'Cause I'm thinking about Oli. - Yeah no, that's really close to the pit. (Paula giggling). (Claudia giggling) And that's it. That's how you kind of mango. Ta-dah! - Yes, there was nothing left to cut. - No, not really. - Mm-mm, mm. - That's it. - Now how are these as far. as fat or calories concerned? - Oh no, we don't care about that. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] We don't? - We're in Paula Deen's kitchen, we don't care about calories or fat. No, it's not fat. It's just fruit. It's a natural fruit, natural sugar. All good for you, vitamin C. (tongue clicks) Love vitamin C. - Oh, take that one home with you. - [Claudia] Oh, is that enough? - Yes.. - Okay, great. I'll take it with me and I'll. give it a couple of days. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Claudia] Perfect, awesome. - [Paula] 'Cause I don't. want you to cut it, if it's- - [Claudia] Yeah. - So what we're gonna do now, is put all the fruits and this bowl. If you wanna do that. - Okay, I'll help you. - And then we made a. sauce to goes with it. - Blueberries, strawberries,. green melon, kiwi. - [Paula] You're stirring. that up a little bit. - [Claudia] We're putting. it in the bigger bowl. - [Paula] Mm-hmm. - [Claudia] Ta-dah! It's Beautiful. - [Paula] Yes. Now, I would not sauce the whole thing. - [Claudia] Yeah, maybe too much. - [Paula] Yes, I would give. everybody a little cup. - [Claudia] Probably by portions, because if you have leftovers, you don't want it to get mushier. - [Paula] No, yeah. 'Cause you want it to have a longer life than what it would be. All right, so let's get us. Let me see if I can- - [Claudia] We need to mix this, wait. - [Paula] Okay. (water running) - [Claudia] So you get all the fruit. That's beautiful. - [Paula] Isn't that pretty? - [Claudia] It's a rainbow salad. - [Paula] And with the fruit, there's your toothpick, and with the fruit being. so plentiful right now. - [Claudia] Oh yeah. I'm gonna get a kiwi. - [Paula] I'm gonna get a strawberry. (Paula giggling) - Mm, that's delicious, mm-hmm. - That's kick butt, isn't it? - Mm-hmm, you know what you can do too. You can do this as skewers? Is that what's it called? And then you can serve them I guess for a pool party or something. and you can dip them. This is delicious. - [Paula] I've got some skewers. if you want to take some. - [Claudia] I have some too. - [Paula] Okay and make the kids. Mm. - I don't know if I'd trust. them with the skewers. (Claudia laughing) Not sure. - That sauce is delicious, isn't it? - Mm-hmm. - Look. - Just drink it, cheers. - Cheers. (Claudia laughing) - [Paula] Bon appetit. (Claudia laughing) (Paula laughing) - Is that yummy? - It's like condensed milk? - Yeah, it kind of tastes, mm, there's no condensed milk in it. - That's good, mm.. - Mm. - Mm. - Thank you. - Thank you Ginny. - I knew that I knew- - Somebody that could cut. a mango. (Claudia laughing) - A real expert, 'cause honey, I wouldn't. near about done it that way. (both laughing) I would've been here. chomping and chomping. - Cut your fingers. - So I want you to take. this to the babies. - I will, mm-hmm. And I've got a lot more. fruit to give you too. - So thanks, Claud rushed. home to help do this with me. - So I appreciate it. - You're welcome. - And I love you. - Love you too. (lips smacking) - I love you. So that's it. - What I'm gonna do? - What are you gonna do? - No I said, I'm gonna take some of it. - You're not gonna take all of it? - It's a lot. (Claudia giggling) - Please take all of it.. - Okay, I will. - The way your kids go through fruit. (Paula laughing) - Bye-bye y'all.. - Bye. - Love and best dishes.;['postres']
L9D51j5JMwQ.json;"- Hey, y'all come on into the kitchen. Michael has just walked in,. he just got him from work, and he's here for a few minutes. He done been to the grocery store. - Hey, y'all. - We just went last night. We got a great big, old. buggy full of stuff. Where's mine? Oh, there it is. I'm just checking. Michael, I am fixing to make a. recipe that a friend sent in. She's is from, where is she from? Did she tell me where she was from? She doesn't tell me, but her name is Laurie Duffy, and she has sent us a recipe that she knows is 45 years old now. And, the lady that gave. her the recipe called it cinnamon donuts, because. that's what they kind of, taste like, but they're actually. cooked in muffin tins. And, she says, ""Dear Paula. I want to start out by saying how much your videos have meant to me during this whole pandemic time. My family has all gotten. used to hearing your voice, and Eddie and Teresa's when. they come down the stairs. I've gotten so much joy out of watching."" And, I thank you so much, Laurie, because that was my intention. To be there, to keep company, to some of those folks out there. that was quarantined alone, and so thank you for sharing. those kinds of words with me. So, this was shared many,. many, many, many years ago, and it was sort of, it was at sort of, a church gathering, which, you know, there's some fine food at. those church church meals on the ground, those picnics, those women to the church house, they know they know how to cook. And so, here we go. It's one 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour. I'm just going to put it right in there. And, it calls for a. 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, one 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder. Powder, not soda, but powder. 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. And, we're gonna just take our whisk and whisk that all together. until it's incorporated. And, our next step is to take. 1/3 cup of solid shortening, and we're gonna cut that. in to our flour mixture. And, I looked in my drawer and I can't find my pastry cutter, so I'm just going to try. to do it with this fork. I might have to invite. a knife to come in too on this action. So, we're starting off. like we're making biscuits. So, this will take just a few minutes. If you can find Joe pastry cutter, you might be able to do it. quicker than what I'm doing, but it won't take me just a few minutes, Think I'm gonna go. ahead and add our sugar, cut that along with the dry ingredients. And, that was 1/2 cup of sugar, y'all. Just in time for you to cook supper. So, we just gonna stir in our milk, and I really got that shortening. cut in there real good using that fork. So, we just want to mix this. until it's moist, you know, muffins the recipes will tell. you not to over mix a muffin. You want to just mix them. until there's no moisture. Right, now this is supposed. to make a dozen, right? How many is it supposed to make, Laurie? It's supposed to make one dozen, so apparently she doesn't. overfill the muffin tins. So, let's see if we can get. it separated into those cups, and get it right the first time. So, I'll start by doing that, and then we'll turn around and come back, and add more if there's any left to add. This batter is nice and thick, so it's pretty easy to scoop up. It's not dripping everywhere, I like that. - [Michael] I love the pictures. - Oh, do you like them? Which is your favorite? - [Michael] Well, I love. that one that Holly sent in. - With who? - [Michael] Holly. - Oh, I'm telling you. that deep (inaudible). - [Teresa] Maybe we could show it? - Yes. I don't see why we couldn't. We are having y'all- - [Eddie] I think it's more, I'm the boss. - [Teresa] Yeah, she's the boss for sure. - You got to get one. in here when you fish. - Oh, it's over there. You didn't see it. Oh, no. The one of Henry, he's. playing his saxophone. I wanted that one. - [Michael] And can you hear it? It doesn't do it justice. until you hear it. - Oh, it so terrible. He's having trouble playing. his little saxophone. So, did y'all show everybody the picture? Eddie has found this place. to order pictures from, and y'all, it's so reasonable. I mean, those pictures would. cost me thousands of dollars and I mean, what do. they run a piece, Eddie? - [Eddie] Well, you know, I. catch it at different times. I don't know the exact price because I always catch. it with a sale code. - Yes, with the sales code. Bye, Mikey. - [Michael] Bye. - I'll have you a donut waiting. - [Michael] Tell my fans. I have to go to work, I have another job. - Okay, Michael for me to tell. his fans he has another job. - I have another job, other than acting. - [Eddie] See you on the road. - He is so goofy. - [Teresa] Thank goodness. he has another job. - Yes, thank goodness he has another job, 'cause we might go hungry. if his only job was acting, you think Teresa? But so anyway, this place,. we've got one huge wall, like, in a hallway, y'all. at our remodeled home that we're moving in in. the next couple of weeks, and it's just a grandkids wall. So, I've got two or three pictures of each of our grandchildren, and that's all it's going. to be is just one wall full of children's. And, I can't hardly wait. We got some cute pictures. Okay. In the oven. Can't remember what Laurie said. - [Teresa] 350 for 20 minutes. - She said delicious served. with coffee or cold milk. - [Eddie] Do you know if those, I'm curious to see if they. turn out those sugar biscuits that we had up in Albany,. from those two girls that- - Oh yeah, it's going to. be much like that Eddie, because when they're done,. we're going to pull them out, dip them into melted butter, and then roll them in cinnamon sugar. So, it might be much like. the sisters in Albany. - [Eddie] Sugar biscuits. - Sugar biscuits. Let's see, bake about 20 minutes, 350. Okay, our muffins are ready. And, Laurie tells us. that they will be pale. So, they are pale, and looking so good. All right, I've got to turn my oven off. So, now we are to, let me see if she says to. let them cool for a second. While still warm roll muffins. into the melted butter and then into the cinnamon sugar. So, I've got a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 3/4 of a cup of sugar, one 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and one stick of melted butter. So, we just want to mix that up real good. That's going to be nice and cinnamony, easy for me to say. Okay. Now, this is the part I like. Dunking them in the butter. Oops. Oh, I sure do hate that happened. A double dip. And then, we just roll. it in the cinnamon sugar. Looks very, very good. I just want to taste one. while their warm, you know? Okay. Yum. - [Teresa] Oh my gosh. I know I say it every time, but like, - But like, what? - [Teresa] I said, I know I. say oh my gosh every time. - I know, me too. - [Teresa] We have such good people with such great recipes. - I know it, and I just love it. I love it when the women share. - [Eddie] You must have. to eat them pretty, while they're hot though. or else the butter will... - It will just soak in. - [Teresa] I have to tell. you shortening just makes it. - Uh huh, it does. - [Teresa] I find that. anything you've done with shortening- - Shortening, yes. That's right. Oh, I hate Michael had to go back to work, but he's on a diet anyways, so. - [Teresa] (inaudible) being good. We don't like those kinds of people. - Okay, I got to have another bite. So good. - [Teresa] You're right.. You could eat this like, this could be breakfast,. this could be a dessert. - Wonderful breakfast. With ice cream, or whipped cream. - [Teresa] I know you said. you'd have to eat them warm, and I kind of agree with. you Eddie on that one, but I guess you could put. them also in little baggies and freeze them? - Oh yes. - [Teresa] And maybe not do your sugar, butter, and sugar until... - You have to do it while they're hot. You have to dip it while they're hot. So, that means you'd have. to put them back in the oven to heat them up. - [Eddie] Well, the recipe. only makes a dozen, right? - Yeah. - [Eddie] So, you can. eat a dozen any time. - Yeah, that's right. - So, y'all have to try. Laurie's recipe for, what do they call them?. What kind of donuts? - [Teresa] She calls them. cinnamon sugar, cinnamon donuts. - Cinnamon donuts. Okay, I got one more to do, and it just did make it with. the cinnamon sugar, y'all. Come on out of there. Maybe I should run this more. in a little more butter, since there's- - [Teresa] I'm surprised. you didn't double dip. - Well, the very first one I. did, but it fell back in there. - [Teresa] No, I meant. the one you were eating. I'm surprised you didn't double dip. - Well, I didn't think about it Teresa, but now you've said something. Look here, that's mine. - [Teresa] You know, I. support you, I support you. - That is so good, y'all. Double dipped. Wow. Come over here and double dip, Teresa. - [Teresa] I already ate mine. - It's so good, y'all. Laurie, thank you so much, honey. And, I'm sure there's going. to be a lot of folks out there enjoying this wonderful,. easy, delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing. Love and best dishes, y'all.";['postres']
lER3OBzsVRA.json;"- Hey, y'all. It is a very, very rare occasion. that I take off my rings, because I'm so afraid I'm gonna lose 'em. But I'm sharing with y'all, we've had a lot of requests. from people that say, ""Hey, Paula, show me how. to make a pie crust."" So I'm gonna share with y'all Paula's Perfect Pie Crust. To me, it's easy. You do it all with your hands. And I like that. So if you need to grab a. pencil and a piece of paper, go ahead and do it now because. we are fixing to get started. We are using two and 1/2. cups of an all-purpose flour. Now this is enough for a two-crust pie. I'm adding three tablespoons of sugar. I think it was three tablespoons, yes. And 1/4 a teaspoon of salt. with a little dark flake in it. I'll get rid of the dark flake. And we're just gonna sift those together. And we've got our butter. chilled really good. And so I'm gonna take my 1/4 of a cup of solid shortening. Now I'm using, uh oh, there's a little piece. of tin foil on that. That wouldn't be good in a filling. So I'm gonna just break this up. And like I said, this is a. butter-flavored solid shortening. And we're just gonna. mix this up until it's, by the time we get the butter. and everything in there, it'll be really crumbly. And we wanna make sure,. y'all keep an eye on me because don't wanna overwork this crust because it'll get tough on us. To me, I think the best pie. crusts are made with lard. And you can actually buy. lard at your grocery store but you have to be careful because it doesn't. necessarily sell real fast so it can almost get a rancid smell to it. So you can pick up the box. and almost kind of smell it. 'Cause like I said, it's. not a fast moving item that, oh gosh, this feels frozen. Lordy mercy, lordy mercy. All right. All right, I'm using 12 tablespoons and this is actually eight. tablespoons and 1/2 a stick. Let me recheck myself, but I'm positive that it's eight tablespoons. I've already torn that paper. up so let's look over here. Two, four, six, eight,. yes. Eight tablespoons. So I'm gonna need four more, which is like 1/2 a stick. Okay. So I'm gonna cut this up. And like I said, you want. your butter real cold 'cause you don't want it to melt. All right, cut it one more time. This is gonna be a nice buttery. pie crust as you can see. And another four tablespoons,. that will give us the 12 tablespoons that we need. You know, pies are really. kind of a dying art. I remember growing up, you. could go in a restaurant, you know, especially the, like the local, locally-owned restaurants, and you could order a. fabulous piece of pie. And there is still a place, I think, that's still serving those. wonderful homemade pies up. And oh, oh gosh. Where did we go on top of that mountain? (laughing) I can't remember. I know there's a casino. Cherokee, Cherokee, North Carolina. There is a restaurant there that serves wonderful homemade pies. But it's getting harder. and harder to find. I think most of the pies that. you get in a restaurant now are probably ordered from food purveyors, because pies can be tricky. They can be a lot of work. You know what? I'm gonna. have to take this watch off. - [Eddie] I think it's the. clasp on your bracelet. - Well, it may be making noise, too, but that watch was what. I was hearing hard. This is my brother's bracelet that he wore up until he passed away. And I just like to have it on my wrist because I feel like. he's never far from me. Okay, so you see, I'm just really working this. with my hands, my fingers. And we want this, when we get through, we want it to be like a. really, like a cornmeal almost. And after I get this mixed up, we're gonna have to put some. ice water in it for the liquids and then we're gonna have to. put it in the refrigerator and let it chill for about 30 minutes because as I work this, that butter is getting. softer and softer and softer. So when I get through, it. will look like cornmeal and not to bore y'all. Run to the kitchen, get you. something to drink. (laughs) And when you come back, I'll have this stuff looking. like a coarse cornmeal. Okay, y'all can see how. this looks like a crumbly, kind of coarse cornmeal. Now we're gonna start. adding our ice water. And it's important that you add ice water. You can see I have ice in my measuring cup and we're probably gonna use anywhere between 1/4 and 1/2 a cup of ice water. And we're just gonna work that. in until we can form a ball. And like I said, we don't. want to overwork this so I'm gonna try to do. this pretty quickly. And then it's gonna go in the refrigerator and sit for about 30 minutes. That butter helps it stick. together really good. So I've used probably a. little bit more than 1/4. Okay. So you can see how easy that was. No mixer, no nothing. All right. So that's pretty dough,. y'all, it's a pretty dough. And we got that together pretty quick. Now I'm gonna halve it and wrap it and put it in the refrigerator. Gonna kind of mash it into a disk so it will chill a little bit quicker. Shoulda pulled out my wax. paper first. (chuckles) Wax paper or parchment paper. I am getting, I'm getting. pie crust all over! Where is the end of that? There it is. These, there we go. Sometimes these cutters. are not all that great on parchment paper and wax paper. Okay. So you can see, we. worked that very, very quickly. We didn't work it long after we got the ice water in it. So let me go ahead and get us. out another piece of wax paper for the next disk. It's a beautiful pastry, y'all. And it should be like no-fail for you. Okay! 30 minutes. And we should be able. to roll that out nicely. Cross your fingers! Some people say they don't. like making pie crust, they don't turn out. So hopefully this will. make you feel differently about a homemade pie crust. And if all else fails, y'all, just make a graham cracker crust, graham cracker crumbs and butter. And a little sugar. That one never fails. Okay y'all, here we go. Our pie dough is nice and chilled. So I'm gonna put a little flour down and you can see I'm using one. of my favorite cutting boards that I came out with at all. times, of all, all times because you see, it's got. pie crust measurements on it. So it tells you how big you have to roll it. So we're going to about a 10-inch, between a nine and a 10, y'all. So you're just gonna gently roll it until we get where we're going. We wanna just keep adding a little flour because we don't want it to, we don't want it to stick to anything. And I'll check underneath and make sure, ooh, see, it's kind of. wanting to stick again so we'll put more flour. And then we'll lift this. side and look over here. And it needs more flour. over here, too, so. There we go, back to rolling. And you'll just want. to go round and round, trying to keep it in a circle. And this ain't nearly like. rolling out dumplings. This is a softer dough so it actually rolls out pretty good. Okay, now that's more, more than enough 'cause we have gone over our 10-inch mark. So I like to do a little bit more. I like to roll it a little. bit more than I need to because I like to have some extra crust so I can fold it under to make us a nice, pretty crust on the rim of our, see just. like that, just tuck that under, tuck the extra under. And we gonna have a nice, pretty, in fact may have to take some of it off. Okay. So that's very, very, pretty. Pretty, pretty crust. All right, now I'm gonna show you, if it's not thick enough in places, I got a little extra left so I'll just stick that underneath in the places that it. came up a little short. - [Eddie] And this is a. really old-fashioned deep pie. - This is an old-fashioned deep dish pie. And the pie, the, pie plate that I'm using, it's old timey. You know, it's an old one that I had. Like I said, if it's short, just add that extra little. crust I had left over. Kind of make it even. - [Eddie] This would be. good for a chicken pot pie. - This would be delicious. for a chicken pot pie. Yes, Eddie, you are correct. Now, I'm gonna show you a couple of ways that you can do this. To me, well the easiest way is to fork it. And it's probably, I mean it looks, makes it look very homemade,. but this is the easiest. See the way I've just forked that around? But to me, I like to do it the way. I'm fixing to show you, to me it just looks a little prettier. And you'll want to make sure you get it pressed down in your pan real good. And depending on what. kind of pie you're making, it'll tell you to go ahead. and cook off your pie crust. But like, if you're making a pecan pie, you would just pour your. custard part of your pie straight onto a raw pie shell because it's gonna have to cook. And it might not be a bad idea to brush the bottom of your pie crust with a little egg wash. All right. So this is what I like to do. See the way I'm doing that? Pinch and pull, pinch and pull. - [Theresa] And then you're. gonna freeze that, right? - [Paula] I am gonna freeze this because we're not gonna. make a whole pie today. I just wanted to show. y'all how to make a crust. - [Theresa] How long can. these stay in the freezer? - [Paula] Oh gosh, I'd. say a good while, Theresa. You'll just want to cover. it and protect it, you know? - [Theresa] Wrap it up tight. - Mhm. Wrap it up tight. So this is it, y'all. It's really very, very simple. And the recipe is called. Paula's Perfect Pie Crust. So like I said, I'm. not baking a pie today. I just wanted to share with y'all how to make a pie crust. And, so I'm gonna give. you a couple of tips. If you're needing to bake. off your crust first, say, if you're gonna make a cream pie, like a chocolate cream. pie or coconut cream pie, you'll need to bake your crust off. And before you bake it,. you'll want to take your fork and prick all over your pie crust. And that is to keep from bubbles coming up because it will, if you don't prick it, a big old bubble could. show up in your crust, wanting to ruin your party, so. And I like to put down. parchment paper or wax paper and use my pie beans,. pour my pie beans on. And that keeps the bottom. of your pie intact. So that's my couple of hints for you as far as baking 'em off. And I do hope that you'll try it, try your hand at pie crusting 'cause it's really, really. not that complicated. But it sure is easy to. run to the grocery store and buy that frozen crust, y'all. But this is almost as easy. So there you go! Paula's Perfect Pie Crust. Happy bakin'!";['postres']

lstXG6UnorY.json;"- Come on in the kitchen y'all because I have a recipe from a fan out there that calls this a diabetic coma cake. And I don't think he means it keeps you from going into a diabetic coma. I think he means it will send. you into a diabetic coma. It sounds wonderful. This recipe was sent in. to me from Jeffrey Bridges and he was just so cute. with his little letter. He told me that... He wrote and he said that he. has a recipe from his grandma that he would just love for me. to have if I was interested. Well, of course I'm interested. I love hearing from y'all and knowing what your grandmothers or your mothers did for you. So he told me, he said, ""Call me if you have any. questions about making this cake."" Did I tell y'all the name. was a banana fruit cake, which doesn't sound like... Don't think it's a fruit. cake 'cause it's not. 'Cause I'm not crazy about fruitcakes but you know what? He sent me his phone number. If I can find it. Oh, here it is. (phone beeping) I bet he won't answer. 'cause it's going to come in not recognizable or something like that. - [Theresa] Or he might be at work. - Yeah. But maybe it says cell number. (phone ringing) You know, I know one. thing, nobody can talk about me and butter anymore. (laughs) As long as... - [Voicemail: Jeff] Hey,. you've reached Jeff. Leave your name and number after the tone and I'll get back to you. as soon as I can, thanks. - [Voicemail Prompt Voice] At the tone, please record your voice message. When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press. pound for more options (beep). - Hello Jeffrey. It's Paula Dean and I knew you. wouldn't pick up your phone. You tell me that you're. not a weird person, that, laugh out loud,. I'm just a funny gay guy. Well, I still like to think I'm just a old funny straight girl. So we make a good pair. All right, let's see. Please let me know when. she will be making this. I would like it dedicated. in the memory of my grandma, Grandma French. So Grandma French was heavy. into the butter as well. So Jeffrey, I'm so sorry. that I couldn't get you, dear but I wanna thank you for. sending in the recipe, and I'm making it right now, and I'm showing your recipes, I'm sharing your recipe. for Grandma French cake, banana fruit cake. I am sharing that with all. of our friends out there. So thanks Jeffrey. Sorry I missed you. Bye bye. Too bad, I wanted to talk to Jeffrey. All right, what is this? It takes so many. different pairs of glasses just for me to get the job done, I can't remember. All right, so I'm gonna. do what Jeffrey said. He didn't tell me about. the bananas, you know. But, you know, I think. I'm gonna throw those into the mixer instead of mashing them. I think I'll just... (mixer whirring) I'll do it this way. And he said, ""add all your. wet ingredients together."" So I'm gonna to beat that up. Mash those up pretty. good and pretty quick. And I like this cake. because we're gonna cook it in a 13 by nine by two. Jeffrey said, ""Cook it. in an 11 by nine pan."" I don't know about 11 by nine pans, so I'm gon' cook it in a 13 by nine pan. And I like that because that means I just don't have to put a cake together. You know, like two or. three layers together. All right, I'm going to. add my two cups of sugar. I'm gonna add two eggs and Jeffrey said that he... This is what he did different. from his grandmother. He said he separated his eggs and he beat his whites. until they were stiff. But I'm not doing that Jeffrey. I'm gon' do like your Grandma said. Not that I don't trust you. (laughs) I'm just going to follow Granny's rules. All right, so... two sticks of melted butter y'all. I love it. (mixer whirring) I'm gonna add that kind. of on the slow side. So it won't get all over me. All right, so I have two. and half cups of flour that I'm running through my little sifter, and I've got two teaspoons. of baking soda right here, and Jeffrey says to add three. tablespoons of hot water, and this is pretty hot. Now let me make sure I. don't have the ingredients back asswards mixed up. Two teaspoons of baking soda and three tablespoons of hot water. So I just took this water. out of the microwave, so it's good and hot. I mean, this is really an. easy cake to make, Jeffrey. All right, so I am going to... Sift. I think it's a half a teaspoon of salt. Can you shove that over. to me please, Eddie? Skank ya. All right. Yeah, half a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, one teaspoon of ground cloves. Yep, that's the cloves, and then one teaspoon of nutmeg. And that's the nutmeg. All right, let's see. And then you're gonna add to that one cup of chopped walnuts, but I'm outta walnuts. and we're using pecans, which is perfectly okay. And Jeffrey said one cup of. raisins that are optional. So that was two cups of sugar, two eggs, six ripe bananas that are almost brown, two teaspoons of baking soda, and three tablespoons of hot water, a half a teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon,. ground cloves, and nutmeg. And then we're substituting. the walnuts for our pecans, a cup of raisins, one cup of melted butter, and three and a half cups of flour. So, I'm gonna sift those spices into the rest of the flour. And Jeffrey said to just slowly, slowly add this to our wet ingredients. You know what? When Michael and I married... When Michael and I got married, his favorite cake in the whole world was a banana nut cake. with cream cheese icing. So, the groom's cake was banana nut bread. So Jeffrey, this sounds. a lot like Michael's... one of Michael's favorite cakes. So he is gonna love this. I need my little chute the side. of this but I don't have it. All right, so mix, mix, mix. And then we'll have to stop. and stir down our sides. There, I don't know why I did. it on this side a minute ago 'cause y'all can see. that side much better. Okay, I'm going to try not to get my... My spatula in the beater. Okay. It's smelling good. (phone ringtone). Who's phone is that? Tell them we don't want any. (laughs) We busy. (dog barking) Hey, hey, hey! All right, I'm gonna go ahead. Y'all hush. I'm gonna go ahead and add, y'all, my two teaspoons of. baking soda and hot water. And then, I'm just going to stir my nuts and my raisins in the cake. Those spices, do you smell them, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes! - You know, nutmeg and cloves, they're very strong spices. And what I'm mainly. smelling is the nutmeg. - [Eddie] It smells a lot. like the essential oils that we burn in the kitchen. - Oh yeah, yeah. Sometimes I'll think Eddie's. in the kitchen cooking, but he's just in here burning. things in our little... Oil things. It smells so good. - [Eddie] It's less calories.. - Less calories (laughs) It darn sure is less calories, now, 'cause I ain't had the urge. to go over there and eat that one, not one drop. All right. (mixer whirring) Whoa! All right, I'm going to cut this up, cut that off, and let that beater up so I can get in here and. really clean up the sides of this cake. It's going to be a big fat cake, Eddie. Mmm, smells so good. - [Theresa] That might be. why it takes an hour to cook. - Yeah.. (mixer whirring) And what did he tell us to. bake it on, Theresa, 350? - [Theresa] Bake it on 350,. (mixer drowns out speaker). - [Paula] Okay, well I'm not, I'm going to make sure. that it's not on convection 'cause I didn't, I don't want. the bottom to get over brown. Okay, those bananas make your. batter very, very sticky. See how sticky that looks? All right, a couple more spins. Then we're going to have Granny. French's cake in the oven. Gonna be hard to wait an hour. I'm about to swallow my. tongue right now. (laughs) All right, I'm going to spray my pan. This way we don't need to. worry about turning this out. So it'll live in that pan. until the cake's gone. All right, I'm gonna try to just turn that batter out. So that's pretty good, most of it. Most down it slung off. Just so I won't make a mess, I'll get rid of that. And now I'm going to stir in a cup of nuts and a cup of raisins. And I do love raisins. I love raisins in my cakes. So if you want a plump, plump raisin, you can soak these in hot. water and they'll just puff up, and they'll just become. real tender and big if you want them puffed up, but I'm not puffing these up. 'cause that doesn't matter to me because I just love that little chewy sweet bite of raisin. Okay. So Jeffrey, I hope I've. done it to suit you honey. So here we go into the pan. - [Theresa] Yum.. - [Paula] Huh? - [Theresa] I said yum - Do you want to lick the. bowl, Theresa? (laughs) I think Theresa would. rather have the batter than the actual cake. - [Theresa] You've got it. - Okay. (bowl clangs) Get you some Theresa. - [Theresa] That's unusual. for you to even leave that. - This is going to be a. very, very dense, heavy cake. Very heavy. I can tell just by the. way the batter feels. - [Eddie] So can you tell the difference? What's different about. this from your banana cake? - You know, I don't know, Eddie. Did you taste it, Theresa?. - [Theresa] Not yet. - Well, I didn't hear you... - [Theresa] I'm preserving. the moment for a little while. - You know, when I give. Linton a cookie that he likes, he says, ""Mm-hmm!"", and he will come up to me and say ""mmm"" until I say it. (Theresa laughs) That boy appreciates guineas cookies. This is a delicious batter. Mmm, mm, mm, mm. So, we're going to set. the timer for one hour. And if it doesn't turn out. it's Jeffrey's fault. (laughs) Okay, Jeffrey baby. It's time to frost your banana fruit cake. And I'm telling you what,. honey, this is one dense cake. I mean, feel how heavy it is Eddie, put out your other hand. - [Eddie] Yeah, it's... - I mean, it's dense. It's very heavy. Did you feel it? Yeah. - No, I pilled it, see you. could do a workout with that. - Yeah, I know! So I can't wait to taste it Jeffrey. And you know, I tried to call you earlier, (mixer whirring) but you wouldn't take my call. - [Theresa] Bet he's. going to regret that one! - You know, I got a private phone number so it wouldn't give you a number, and I said, people are. not answering phone calls from unidentified numbers. And I don't blame you a bit. All right, so I have got two sticks of softened butter that I've whipped up, and now I'm adding one. box of powdered sugar per Jeffery's directions. And it calls for one tablespoon of milk. So I'm going to go ahead and add that and see if that will help me incorporate that butter into that. powdered sugar better, and oh, it does. See how it's doing? A little liquid goes a. real long way, y'all, with powdered sugar. Okay, you know, I might as well stop now and add our tablespoon of vanilla. I keep wondering why the, why. this light is bothering me. 'Cause I don't know which. pair of glasses to put on. So there, I've got the best. of both worlds. (laughs) All right, so Jefferey tells me to add this mixture, which is two. tablespoons of very hot water to the three tablespoons. of an instant coffee. And he said just add that,. well now I don't need those. He said just add it slowly until the icing is creamy and that coffee smells delicious. (mixer whirring) Oh, it's going to be a. caramel color, y'all. Look at that. That looks just like caramel icing. - [Eddie] Like a tiramisu. - [Paula] Uh-huh, yeah. All right, so more coffee. This would be good with. some coffee ice cream. This cake. Jeffrey said to pour this. icing on the top of the cake. - [Theresa] I don't think that's pouring. - [Paula] I just can't imagine, you know, this pouring out of the bowl 'cause it's really kind of thick. So, hope I hadn't done. anything wrong, Jeffery. (mixer whirring) - [Eddie] Okay, if the coffee. was supposed to be poured over the cake, then the frosting. - [Paula] No, no, he said last add this and beat until it's creamy. Eddie, uh oh, (laughs) a little slinging (mixer drowns out speaker) Stick your finger in. - [Eddie] That's good.. - [Paula] That is good. - [Eddie] If you're a coffee drinker. - [Paula] If you're a coffee. drinker, you are gonna love it. And you know what? I like cakes. In a 13 by nine by two pan. 'Cause you're so easy to frost. No guessing whether you got enough in the bottom layer or the middle layer. Mmm, Theresa, do you like coffee? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - Well, stick your finger. in that for a second. - [Theresa] I will do it at the top so I won't really get it into anything. - [Paula] Okay, okay good. - [Theresa] Wow. - [Paula] Isn't that good? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm, that's very good. - [Paula] Yes, now you know what? I might like some more nuts. sprinkled on top of that cake. - [Theresa] Is that a hint to me? - [Paula] No, I was just. waiting for y'all to say un-uh, it doesn't need that, or yeah! - [Theresa] I'm not as big. of a nut person as you are. - [Paula] I am a nut. I am a nut lover. - [Theresa] Everything we cook. - [Paula] Uh-huh, got to have my nuts. - [Theresa] Eddie, are you a nut lover? - [Eddie] Yeah. - [Theresa] You like them. Would you put nuts on top of that? - [Eddie] Sure. No, when she said that,. I was trying to think what kind of nuts would be good on that. - [Paula] I mean, would you want a nut with that coffee flavor? Maybe not. - [Theresa] Well, you're. going to have it in the cake. So, might be too many flavors. - [Paula] Yeah.. - [Theresa] Competing. - [Paula] Yes. - [Eddie] You could put like. chopped, chocolate covered- - [Theresa] Well, you. know, the other thing is this is a pretty strong coffee flavor. So like, if you didn't want. it to be this strong coffee you could probably put a, you could lighten up the amount of instant coffee you put in. - [Paula] Yes, yes. - [Theresa] Taste that Eddie. - [Eddie] I've had it. - [Theresa] You already tasted it? - [Paula] All right, who's ready? - [Theresa] I can't believe. Michael's not already here. - [Paula] I know it, Jeffrey. Wait, I hear flip flops. - [Theresa] I do too. And speak of the devil! - [Paula] (laughing) We're. just fixing to cut the cake. - [Michael] I smelt it. - [Paula] This your banana cake. Oh Micheal, you're not. going to believe this cake. - [Theresa] But this. is a different version. Different version. - [Paula] It's a different version, but, I think it's going to taste much like your groom cake tasted.. - [Michael] Oh, good. - [Paula] So come over here and... - [Theresa] The groom cake. didn't have a coffee flavor, though, did it? - [Paula] No,. - [Theresa] Yeah, so - [Paula] No, but the cake part- - [Theresa] The coffee flavor's going to be just a little bit different. - [Paula] Yeah, but the cake part. So, come get your cake. - [Michael] I was so. excited on the reception, I don't even remember what it taste like. (Paula laughing) - [Theresa] He's trying to butter you up. - Well, well it ain't working. - [Theresa] 17 years later. - Yeah, (laughs) all right. - [Michael] I love it. - [Paula] Ooh! Jeffrey. That looks pretty good. The banana smell will knock you down. Smell Eddie. - [Eddie] I can smell it. - [Paula] You can smell it from there? - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. - All right Michael. - [Theresa] Come taste the first piece. - [Paula] So this is. Jeffrey's diabetic coma cake. - [Theresa] Only on special occasions. - [Michael] I'm going to take this one that's got more icing. - [Paula] Okay, you. take any piece you want. - [Michael] I don't know. - [Paula] (laughs) Why don't you eat two? All right, here it goes. Y'all get your cake. - [Theresa] I'm coming, I. want to see Michael's face. - [Michael] All the girls do. - Wow. It tastes as dense as it looks. - It's good. - Mm-hmm. - I get my fruit this way. - [Theresa] Bananas and raisins. - The banana flavor is very good in it. And it's tasty with the icing. The icing makes it. - Delicious. - Thank you Jeffery. Love you. Best dishes.";['postres']
LWRXYp4u9bM.json;"- Hey, y'all, today is gonna. be a fun day in my kitchen because I'm gonna be. walking down memory lane and I am with the best person in the world to walk down memory lane with. because it's my Aunt Peggy. And the sour cream pound cake, I call it Granny Paul's. sour cream pound cake. I have had a thousand. compliments on this, Aunt Peggy. I run into people all the time saying ""I make that grandmother's pound cake and it's out of this world."" And it's so funny 'cause. Grandma was a baker and Mama didn't do a lot of baking. She would have, Bubba and. me, warm banana pudding lots of times sitting on. the counter by the back door when we'd race in from school. And I was asking Aunt Peggy last night, ""You weren't a baker, were you? Did you ever make a cake?"" And she said, ""No."" I said, ""Well, did you. ever make anything sweet?"" And she said, ""Yes."" And I said, ""What?"" She said, ""A chocolate meringue pie."" (laughs) My Aunt Peggy,. trying to describe her. She doesn't want to do what. somebody's telling her to do. (laughs) Then I was coming. up with ways to describe it. And I was thinking free balling it. - [Eddie] No, but maybe. free spirit. Maybe. (laughs) - Free spirit. Anyway, she. doesn't like using recipes. She wants to do it her way. So therefore she's never. had any interest in baking 'cause somebody's telling her what to do and she ain't putting up with that crap. Right?. - Yes. (laughs) - (laughs) Some things never change. She's the president of. her company. (laughs) So (laughs) but listen,. she sure does enjoy them when I make them. And when grandmamma was. around and she made them, so I'm gonna have a question. to ask you in a minute. So I think I'll go ahead. and ask you now, Aunt Peggy. This cake is so beautiful. It's wonderful with just vanilla flavoring but I've got a lot of options over there in my baking cabinet of. different flavors we could use. So I would like for you to be. thinking about what flavor, if any flavor, you would. like this cake to be. We have got, let's see,. what have we got in here? (phone ringing) We've got. almond flavor, vanilla. Excuse me. Y'all I gotta let somebody in. Hello?. - Hey, it's Patty. (indistinct). - Thank you. Bye bye. (doorbell rings). (dog barks) Okay, just go tell 'em. Go let 'em in. It's so funny, Gus knows when. that phone rings a certain way that it's the gate and somebody. is coming in this house. So he's gotta go greet 'em, y'all. All right, Eddie, I'm gonna look up here and see what all kind. of flavorings we got. We got banana, we got coconut.. (dog barking) I can't even read that one.. - That's the orange. - Orange, more banana.. (dog barking) What does that one say, Eddie?. - Peppermint. - Peppermint, she doesn't like peppermint. That's red food coloring. And that's the butter one. So I'll use this with. whatever flavor she picks out. Have you decided yet?. - What flavor? - Have you decided on the flavor you want? - I didn't hear you call out lemon. - (laughs) I knew, I knew. she was gonna say that! And she's right, because. I don't think I have any lemon flavoring.. - We have fresh, fresh lemons. - [Aunt Peggy] Then your choice. - Well, if you wanted a. lemon, we've got fresh lemons and I will use those and. we can grate some zest. - [Aunt Peggy] Yes, I like all that. - Uh huh and what do you do. when you take that skin off? (laughs) Tell me what you do. - I don't like telling you. how to do things. (laughs) - (laughs) What did you call it? - Zass, did I say zass? Jest. - Jest. (laughs). - Jest, I think it was. - One day when we were. in here in the kitchen, she said, ""Can you jest. me some lemon?"" (laughs) And I said, ""What'd you say you want me to get you some lemon?"" (laughs) So that's why I asked.. (laughs) I'm sorry, y'all. I know I've embarrassed. her but I can't help it. - (indistinct). - I love to hear you say jest. (laughs) Alright, so back to business. So I'm gonna be taking a break in a second and I'm gonna jest some. lemon and get some juice up. (laughs). - Great. (laughs) - All right, now in this bowl I have three cups of plain. flour, a teaspoon of salt and lots of times I don't too much measure this stuff either. Half a teaspoon of baking. soda, not powder, but soda. I have six eggs. I have. a cup of sour cream. And I have, at room temperature,. two sticks of butter and three cups of sugar here in my mixer. So I already started. creaming them but here we go. We're gonna let that cream real good. And then we're alternating our. flour and our eggs together. But as soon as this creams, I'm gonna add the sour cream to our mix. Okay, our butter and our sugar has creamed so I have just added. one cup of sour cream. Let's see, what'd I do with my rag? There it is. All right, now we're gonna alternately add our sifted flour, salt and baking soda into our sugar and butter mixture. And we're gonna start with flour and we're gonna end with flour, y'all. And where you would normally. alternate with a buttermilk or something like that, we're gonna alternate with eggs. (dog barking). Sorry, y'all. Hush, hush it's Sullivan! Y'all don't go crazy. Crazy. All right, so there's our one egg. Hey, Sullivan, where have you been? - [Sullivan] (speaker. drowned out by mixer) - Huh? Your new house? What's going on? - [Sullivan] Nothing really. (speaker drowned out by mixer) - Nothing really? - [Sullivan] (speaker. drowned out by mixer) - Okay, well, I missed you. while you was gone. (laughs) Carly and Brian sold the home. that they were living in, y'all, and they bought a new home. Well, it's not new but they are redoing a lot, a lot of things in the house and they can't stay in. the house right now. It's not occupiable. So they are staying here with us while the work is being. done on their home. And it's gonna be. beautiful. Just beautiful. (dog barking). Hush! Hush, hush, hush! I'm telling ya, sometimes I'd like to give them a tranquilizer, Eddie. They bark so much. Not really. 'Cause sure as I'd do it, I would need for them to bark and let me know about something. All right, that's egg number three. It's looking so good. Wow, I just love watching. cake batter come together, especially when I'm using. my Paula Deen mixer. Because I sat down at the. table with my friend, Bob, and told him everything I. didn't like in a regular mixer and everything I would love to have if I could have a mixer developed. And this one is just wonderful. You can see my bowl is turning but you can also see my. beaters are moving back and forth at the same time. And I don't know if Eddie can get in there but if you could see in there, you would see a helping hand that is constantly scraping. the side of the bowl. If you come around here,. Eddie, and shoot down in there, you can see where the. bowl is being scraped. And I don't have to stop not one time to scrape the sides of that bowl. And I love that, y'all. I love that feature. All right, so the fourth egg is going in and this is gonna work. out just about perfect. But I just love seeing it come together. And the thing about my. mixer is lots of times, if you're putting a cake together,. you can get to the bottom when you're ready to. put it in your cake pan is you find just a glob. of stuff at the bottom. Well, I don't seem to have. that problem with this mixer. I just love it. All right, so we're almost there. I'm gonna let that flour get mixed in. The helping hand is the biggest, the biggest treat of all though. Because usually when I'm baking a cake, I'll have to stop, I'll. have to cut the motor. Stop, and at least eight times, I'll have to stop and scrape the bowl. And that gets very old to me. Okay, then we get the flour. Okay, I'm gonna let that turn that flour, let it get one turn. The last egg and that was a good egg. Had a lot of white to it. Did you see that egg?. - Yeah. - Okay and the last of the flour. So, Aunt Peggy, I'm gonna go ahead and add some vanilla flavoring. But then I'm gonna put some. lemon juice in there too, okay? (laughs) I wonder if I should use some of that butter extract. Smells like pure butter, why not. We'll have a buttery lemon cake. Usually, Aunt Peggy,. I put almond flavoring and vanilla flavoring in my pound cake. But I don't think Grandma did. I think she just used. plain vanilla flavoring. Ooh, it's so pretty. That's some pretty, pretty batter. Well, I'm gonna cut the mixer off and I'm gonna take a little break so y'all don't have to sit here watching me squeeze lemons and I'm gonna squeeze some lemon juice and put in this cake for our Great Great. Okay, so now we're ready. to put our cake batter into our tube pan. And I've got about a. tablespoon of zest here. Or jest, a tablespoon of jest. (laughs) Listen, my Aunt Peggy is. as smart as a whip, y'all. She is smart as a whip but she can murder the English language kinda like I can. (laughs). (Aunt Peggy laughs) I don't know where I. get that from (laughs) but Michael and I tease her all the time about her pronunciation of certain words. So anyway, (laughs) anyway. I put a tablespoon of jest (laughs) and I put about a. fourth of a cup of lemon juice. And I really do wish I. had some lemon extract to make it really more lemony. But I think what I'll do is. I'll make a lemon glaze for it and that'll kick that lemon up. I think you're gonna like it. Aunt Peggy just asked me, she said, ""What if I don't like it?"" I said, ""If you don't like. it, don't tell me."" (laughs) (Aunt Peggy laughs) I said, ""But all I have. to do is look at your face and I'll know that you're lying (laughs) if you're telling me you. like it and you don't. I'll so be able to tell."" 'Cause you are like your niece. or your niece is like you. Lying ain't one of our fortes. (laughs) - No, we get too much joy. out of telling the truth, - Out of telling the truth, yes. - as we see it. (laughs) - So I will be able to. tell if you don't like it. And we're gonna cook this cake on 325 for maybe 65, 75 minutes. I think Grandma said that she cooked it for about an hour and 20 minutes. I can't remember. I'll. have to look at the recipe. I'm getting every bit of that goody out. So I'm gonna leave enough. for Aunt Peggy to lick that and tell me if she tastes any lemon on it. Here, you gotta, I'm not gonna stand here and then hold it for you. (laughs) She's been here six. months, and I have to say, I think I mighta spoiled her a little bit. You think, Eddie? (laughs). (Eddie laughs) I've loved taking care of. her, during this COVID stuff. - Yeah, I was coming. for three or four weeks. - (laughs) Yes, you was. coming for three weeks, it's been six months. But she has had terrible,. terrible, terrible back and hip issues, so I kinda had. a captured audience with her. (laughs) She couldn't walk.. (Aunt Peggy laughs) And she couldn't walk,. she couldn't go home. All right, you taste any. lemon in that at all? - Yes, I do and it, so far,. the flavor to me is good but you can make a judgment. - I'll make a judgment when. you eat a piece of the cake and I look at your face. (laughs) So let's see what Grandma said. An hour and 20 minutes at 325. Let's see. Our oven is on convection, so I think I'm gonna take. that off of convection, Eddie. Because this oven, when. you've got it on convection, it's very, very hot. All right, so I'm gonna set our timer. And I will see y'all back here, probably in an hour and 20 minutes. But, y'all, it's gonna seem. like that long. (laughs) That hour and 20 minutes. just gonna fly by. (laughs) Okay, y'all, our beautiful. pound cake is ready. Grandma Paul's sour cream pound cake and Great Great asked for it to be lemon. So look at that.. - Smells wonderful. - Doesn't it smell wonderful. Well, come look at it, Great Great. Now Grandma said cook it. for an hour and 20 minutes. We cooked it for an hour and 10 minutes. Isn't that pretty?. - Mm-hmm. - What do you think about. me making some syrup, some lemon syrup water and. just pour a little of that over there to give it. that fresh lemon taste? - Mm-hmm, that'd be good. - Okay, well, let's do that.. - Good. - We'll pour on top and then. (laughs) Oh, you're welcome.. You're welcome, I love ya. So I'll get some syrup going on the stove and we'll pour it over it. Okay, friends, I have made a lemon syrup and I'm just gonna pour. some of this around there because I really am hoping since I didn't have any lemon extract and I really wanted to give it. a good, strong lemony flavor. So you just kinda wanna. do maybe equal parts sugar to equal parts water. And I took my little bitty. spoon that Eddie gave me that, I love this spoon so much, this is what I made my. holes with in my cake. And I put my lemons in and cooked them along with the sugar water. and the juice from the lemons. So we're gonna just pour. that on and let that sit and then we're gonna. take it outta the pan. And then I'm gonna make a. little lemon glaze for the top when it comes out. Oh, look, Great Great's clapping. (laughs) - I like the glaze.. - (laughs) She likes that. I like a glaze too. Look, y'all, the boys are multiplying. Another one just showed up. This is Henry. Are you number four or number five? - Three.. - Three. - Oh yeah, you're number three. - I'm second.. - No, you're not second. - You're not second!. - I'm older than John. - Well, you're not older. than me. I turned nine. - All right, Jack came first. Maddie came next, Henry name next. - Third. Then Sully. - Sully may be fourth.. - Years. - I think you came before John. - Yeah.. - Backwards. One of the ways. Anyway, there's 11 of them, y'all and I never know when. they're gonna show up. But it's just funny that. they showed up for cake time. - For cake.. - There's something very suspicious about that. (laughs) Oh, they're so sweet, y'all. So they helped me mix up a glaze for our Grandma Paul's sour cream pound cake that we turned into a lemon. pound cake for Aunt Peggy. So we have made a glaze. Well, after we did that,. I poked holes in it and I made up a lemon sugar syrup, cooked it for a while 'til it was thick, and then I poured that over the cake while it was still in the pan. But now, guys, we're gonna. spoon a glaze over it 'cause Great Great likes glazes. Just like me too. (laughs) So we're just gonna let. that run down the edges. And we made our glaze,. y'all, out of cream cheese, - Yummy.. - powdered sugar and our liquid was lemon juice. So didn't I say we put. a little cream cheese in it, Eddie?. - Yes. - [Paula] Cream cheese,. powdered sugar, lemon juice. - [Henry] That's why. it smells like lemons. - Yes, that's why it smells like lemon and I like a thick glaze, I just like for it to stick. I like for it to be thick. enough that you can see it. So I'm gonna take that now and just start kinda spooning and I let the cake get real, real cool. It's been sitting for a while. What do y'all think?. - Yummy. - What do y'all think?. - Yummy. - What do you think? Ooh.. - I don't know. - You don't know? (laughs). - It looks so good. - It does look so good. So good. - Can we help?. - Can you help? - Yeah.. - All right, can you-- - Me and Henry.. - Okay, can you take that spoon and drizzle it where you see. Whoa! (laughs) Yeah, do it, there you go. - Voila.. - Voila. All right, Henry, you get the next spoon. - Yeah.. - And just drizzle that where you think it needs it. Don't. Whoa, whoa, whoa! (laughs) Can't put it in the hole. (laughs) There ya go. - [Sully] Just drizzle it. on the bottom of the cake. - [Paula] That looks like a. cinnamon roll, doesn't it? - [Sullivan] Looks like a big-- - [Paula] Eddie makes wonderful-- It looks like a big cinnamon roll. - Cinnamon roll.. - Cinnamon. Cinnamon. - Cinnamon. Okay, I. think we've got one more. I think Guinny can get, ooh, I did. I was able to get one more spoon. Who's swallowed their tongue yet? Has anybody swallowed their tongue? - [Henry] I already licked my fingers. - [Paula] (laughs) That looks like a great big cinnamon roll. I love it, I love it. So we want a little to. fall down around the edges. See, I'm gonna just encourage. it to roll down the sides just a little bit.. - This one's rolling down all the way.. - Yeah, that's running down good, isn't it. So you just--. - Smur it. - Huh?. - Smur it. - (laughs) Smear it?. - Smur it. - (laughs) Now who. pronounces smear like that? Who have you heard say smur it? - Well, I'm country so. - (laughs) Oh, you are? I thought you were a city slicker. - Well, all right in the city but I get my accent from my mom and dad. - Oh, you get your accent. from your mom and dad? - Yeah.. - What kind of accent do you have?. - Country. - Country. (laughs) You think. your mama sounds country? All right now, boys?. - Yes. - Are y'alls fingers sticky? - No, 'cause they only got-- - Well, why don't y'all. come wash your hands anyway just for Guinny.. - Hot! Well, turn it, Henry, if it's too hot. Okay, a little lemon zest. And Great Great, come up here. and look at your cake now. Come look.. - Turn that water off, Sull. - [Aunt Peggy] Come on, come on. Come, come, come, come, come.. - Come, come, come, come. - [Henry] That lemon powder? That lemon powder, Guinny? - No, that's lemon jest.. - Lemon-ine, lemon-ine. - Aunt Peggy called it lemon jest one time and I won't let her live it down, boys. All right, come on up here. next to your Great Great and let's take a picture.. - It's called lemon-ine. - All right, get in. there in different sizes. - Are we still doing a video?. - Yes. (laughs) You know, this is just wonderful. The age difference, being in the kitchen. with the older and wiser and being in the kitchen. with the young ones that are just starting. their road to hopefully a long, healthy, happy, good life just does something to me. So I hope y'all have the opportunity, or have had the opportunity, to know what I'm talking about. Bon appetite and love and. best dishes. (laughs).";['postres']
LZKX5avUKFg.json;"- [Paula] We were looking. at this, uh, this recipe, and Eddie said now that sounds like an. old timey Christmas cookie. And we, Casey and I. both said, yes it does. And Jamie Williams sent this one in to me. And it's, it says, no title. provided ""raisin balls"" So that's a good name for. me, Jamie, raisin balls. She said, my mom made this. cookie every year for Christmas. I hope you pick me for your. 12 days of Christmas cookies. I love you all so much. Thank you, Jamie. And we return that love to ya, girl. Nothings sweeter than. the sound of your words. All right, I'm gonna put in. two cups of golden raisins in the skillet and I'm gonna. cover it with one cup of water. And Jamie says to, uh, let those cook until all the water has cooked out of them. So that's, that's what we're gonna do. So they gonna be real plump and real delicious. All right. Jamie told us to, uh, cook. our golden raisins, two cups of raisins and one cup of. water until the water is gone. And you can see the water is gone. (Casey laughs off-screen) So we're gonna have some wonderful plump golden raisins for our raisin balls. Now the first thing we're. gonna do is we're gonna cream our sugar along with is it one cup of oil? - [Casey] Mm-hmm - Not a cup and a half? - [Casey] One cup - Okay. Wonder where my glasses are? (Laughing) Let me get 'em. Okay, so it was, uh, one and a half cups of sugar. That's where I saw the one and a half. All right, so we're gonna beat our our oil and our sugar. Normally at this point it. would usually you think about butter, but uh these. are gonna be with oil So that's gonna be very interesting. - [Eddie] Yeah. - Do you ever make cookies using oil? - [Casey] No - You know, I don't recall it either. I'm sure I have just don't recall it. All right, let's see. Cream those together then add two eggs, three cups of flour, a. half a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla extract along with one teaspoon of baking soda. So There we go. So I'm gonna go ahead and add, oops. I'm gonna go ahead and add our eggs and I'll go ahead and add our vanilla - [Casey] Here's some more if you need - Thank you. You know, I. want some more vanilla. If it calls for one. teaspoon, I'll usually do two just cause I can. (Laughing off-screen) All right, we got a little salt and a little soda. So I'm mixing our dry. ingredients together. Why does that vanilla always look like it Some wants to stay in. the bottom of the bowl. That's good extract. Okay, here we go. We're on our way, Jamie. Now the last thing that we're gonna add is gonna be our raisins after they're cooled. You wanna stick those in. the fridge, Casey, or either in this refrigerator drawer right there? - [Casey] Mm-hmm, yep. - Because these are gonna. mix up pretty quickly, quicker than I think the raisins to cool. I think this'll get done first. (Mixer whirring) And Jamie says this makes like seven dozen Is that what she said? - [Casey] Mm-hmm - That's a bunch of raisin balls. Okay. That's it. That is it. And we're gonna roll these in sugar before we bake 'em right? And I like that. That gives your cookies a little crackled, kind. of a little crackled look. The last thing to go in our bowl is our cooled, fat plump raisins. And if you didn't have golden raisins I think a regular raisin would work fine. Don't y'all? - [Casey] Yep. - Does a golden raisin. taste different from - [Eddie] I don't know. - I don't know. I've never done a taste test. And again, this is a stiff batter so it's gonna require a little work. I'm getting my workout today. Looks like mashed potatoes with raisins. (Laughing off-screen) All right, (Paper crinkling) now we're gonna roll these in sugar. And, uh, Jamie said they make like seven dozen. So I'm thinking she must make 'em fairly small cause they're gonna puff up. Okay, here we go. Jamie! I couldn't wait for it to cool. I'm sorry. These are delicious. But I'm one of those people that I love a raisin cooked in breads and cakes, but this is really good. Really, really good. They're kind of cakey and your instructions. said bake for 10 to 15 No 15 minutes. And I probably baked these. about 13 to 14 minutes. So thank you so much, girl, for. sharing this recipe with us. This is one of those cookies. that's gonna get better as it cools, Eddie. - [Eddie] Can I try? - Thank you, Jamie. Yes, dig in. Thank you Jamie. Love.";['postres']

to be you're the master and i'm your puppet baby i've been waiting for this give me two cups of sugar okay that's your hookup all right now let me know when you want to cut your stove on because i'm going to hold it all in before we cut it on okay i've got your eyes over here that'll turn that stove on good okay so two cups i need a cup of half and half cream a cup and a half all right just go ahead and just pour it in yeah pour it in okay and i need a eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda okay and that's the ingredient nobody knows about really what's the recipe now that's soda not powder that's correct right an eighth of a teaspoon okay there you go and then however much butter you want to put in it cause i'm gonna [Laughter] when i'm cooking any recipe out of your cookbook i follow the directions when i use somebody else's i've double the rest butter recipe so give us about a third of that stick and we'll make it a little buttery than normal just a third because it's yours wow okay now let's get the heat on it okay i want you to use a medium heat because this cream will uh certainly scorch if you don't keep it moving okay and you want to stir this and this is something you cannot stop stirring you got to stir it the whole time so if you can talk in a stir you can have this job if you cannot you just won't work i can talk and stir i can i can multitask oh you want me to do well oh okay this will take about 15 minutes so i'll keep you busy for a while and we're going to cook this to the softball stage which is about 238 or 240. okay now i like to cook it just to shade more than that and i can do it by eye because we've done it so much but if you don't know what you're looking for you need to have that thermometer okay there you go okay stick that in it's gonna move

excited then i tried to take them up and they wouldn't come up they just fell apart i didn't know you had to butter the marble that was 30 years ago so they crumbled and we still sold them so i knew that oh i'm good i bet that's how you came up with the idea because when you go in to stay in store you can get samples i always get a sample so i bet you that's where that came from with little pieces in the beginning uh-huh the little pieces in the beginning that's good butterqueen that'll do it oh that's good well save it over here i just i'll just put this in my pocket you remember when

MEtMz_uMWlo.json;- I need to go out here to the candy jar and get um a few pieces. I'm not going, not going. outside, you wanna go outside? All right go outside. We going to get some candy. (frightening scream noise). (scared shocked expression) (eerie laughing) (laughing and giggling) (laughing) who does that sound like? It sounds like me. Um. I thought she was the cutest little witch. And so every Halloween I put it by the candy dishes. So I can tell when my grandchildren are nabbin candy. All right Lulu, you comin or going? I can't Mikey (back. round speaker talking), oh their beautiful Lulu's. outside ( back round speaker). (laughing) Oh, I forgot my candy. I forgot my candy. (back round speaker) Okay. (frightening scream noise) (man giggles) somebody's steeling the candy.( laughing) Oh my gracious, Happy Halloween Y'all! Oh we are gonna start with our pretty Halloween glasses first, and we're going to be making parfaits um for the children for Halloween. Look at, look at those skinny skeleton fingers. wrapping around that glass. See it's like this. - Perfect. - Yes. - Perfect match. - And this is very easy. Um. Theresa did do one part. though earlier for us, because it has to sit for. like four to six hours in the refrigerator. And I will share with y'all um what that part is. It's three 15 ounce cans. of Mandarin oranges. That's in water, um three tablespoons of sugar and one and a half teaspoons of cornstarch. Now you're gonna put that together, bring it to um, a light boil on top of the stove. And um you want to reserve eight Mandarin orange sections for us to garnish. on our Parfaits with. And when you're heating this up, you want to kind of break. up your Mandarin oranges, you know, with a wooden spoon. So um you put that in the. refrigerator, like I said, and let it um refrigerate for four to six hours, or overnight, but you do want that cold. All right now to put. our Parfaits together, I have two cups of heavy whipping cream and I've got confectionary sugar, and I'm going to beat until it forms soft, soft peaks. Okay. Now that's um beat just about perfect. You don't want it so stiff. that it turns back butter. You want it to kind of collapse just like that there when it fell off. So now we're going to come. on over here, to this bowl, and we're going to put in. one eight ounce package of softened cream cheese, You know me, I'm gonna fool around. and get every bite of it. All right. And then. we've got our honey here. Let's see how much money is that two tablespoons of honey. And we just to beat. that until it's smooth. And then we're going to. incorporate our two dishes. (whisking noise) okeydoke Now I'm going to start by bringing my whipped cream, my sweetened whipped cream over here, and I'm going to kind of slowly work that into our cream cheese And hopefully get it a little aerated, get some air in it. I love cream cheese and. I loved whipped cream, fresh whipped cream. there's just nothing's, any better. So this is going to make quite a few little Parfaits. And once I get it kind of folded in, then I feel like I can kind of give it a couple of good stirs to make sure it's incorporated. So here it goes the last. of our whipped cream in with our cream cheese. You know, you can put those two. ingredients together and there's so many things that you can make from that point. There is just so many ways that you can change this about and make all kinds of desserts. I think I'd have been safe to. go ahead and beat this with a mixer you know at 80. Okay. All right now to Parfaits together and you can kind of do this in any order that you want to, but, this is the way I'm going to do mine for our crust, where you using just a chocolate wafer. No, no cream centers. And we're going to put that layer down and that's going to act as our crust. Okay. Next we're going to Put a cream cheese layer. Oh I was trying not to do that, I'm gonna get a spoon look at this Eddie, Eddie gave me these little set of wooden spoons. And I think they're so. precious. In fact, Michelle, when she was shooting a. video with me the other day, she said, where did you get. those adorable little spoons? So remind me, Eddie um I need to order her some for Christmas. That could be a Christmas present. - Ill have to Ill have to. look when I go after the show - All right, I'm going to need. Yes. That would be wonderful um if you would do that, because I know that that would please her. All right. Now I'm going to put a few more like a little light layer. Again, and then another light layer of this. And then, its one of. them finger licking shows and look at this our oranges. are the color of our glasses. How cute is that? And the children are gonna love it. Let's see what I wonder if we have a scary finger that we could put on that? Aint that cute? Cute, Cute, Cute. I know Peeps push me that candy jar. Let me see what's in here. Oh how about a little pump in patch. How's that Eddie? - Looks good. - Got some more pumpkin patches. Okay. So like I said, you can layer these any way you want to, And you can make as many layers as you want to. - I'm gonna make one. - You going to make one, come on, come on and make one Peeps. - I like more layers. - Well you do it any way you want to. Well.. and we could do a candy corn. Its so so smaller. Than the than the Cabbage, then the pumpkin I'm going to use three of those. Okay. So just that easy. And I believe that this is in one of the issues of cooking with. Paula Deen magazine. I think, let me see the notes on this. Yes. So all you have to do, if you want um some ideas for Halloween, all you have to go do is go to www.pauladeenmagazine.com And um, and then once. you get in, you know, you can hit search and just. search for Halloween recipes, right Peeps? - Yeah. - You're creating a. masterpiece, Aren't you? - Yeah. Am I taken too much time? - No, like we said early, you can't rush an artist. - That's right. - So this is what I'm giving the children. for dessert tonight. - Now that's perfect. - You're happy. You're happy with that? - No not yet. (laughing) - Oh, that's right. You hadn't gotten your Mandarin oranges. Do you want to pumpkin. to go on top of yours? - No, mine is a diet one. (laughing) - You could make this light, sure enough That's so pretty Michael,. look at all the layers. Show him over here where. there's not so many fingers. - Yeah - All the pretty colors. Wow. You could make this. lighter because you could use um sugar-free chocolate wafer. You could use a light cream cheese. (laughing) You could move, use a light cream cheese (laughing) and a light cream cheese. (laughing) You want to spin? Oh, you know what I forgot? - What? - Forgot to put the chocolate curls on it. - Oh good I'll have some of that for mine. Oh, you did put a pumpkin patch. - Yeah. - That's it yeah - That's going to be prettier. Oh, that's so pretty. See those chocolate curls. I can't imagine what I. could do. If I could see, I could really be good. at this Eddie. (laughing) You know, if I could just see. Beautiful! Well Micheal, Happy Halloween! Bon appetit! - Cheers! - Oh I've got a itchy eye. - Cheers! - Cheers! Bottoms up. Happy Halloween! (loud witching laugh);['postres']
mEZfZuZ3DyI.json;"- Hey, my dear friends. Come on into the kitchen with me. You know, I'd like to think of y'all as all being on a stool,. sitting around this counter, and we're having a soda, or a. cup of coffee, and laughing, and just enjoying one another's. company, exchanging stories. Well, I know that can never happen. Not all of us will fit around. that counter, to start with. But Eddie gave me a few, what would you call these? They're not letters, Eddie. - [Eddie] Comments. - Yeah, more of a comment than anything. And these were on my YouTube channel. And so, which brings me to... Thank y'all all so much for your support. And I hope I've been a little. bit of comfort to y'all that have maybe been quarantined and not around your family or your friends like you used to be. So that was certainly my goal for this little Quaran-Deen Cooking show. I don't even want to call it a show. It's more like, help me come up with a word. It's more like vignettes or something. I mean, some of the. recipes are really long, and some are real short,. just like a recipe is. But Eddie just brought. these three to my attention a few minutes ago. This is from Sweet Home, Alabama. ""Paula, you need to do. a livestream one day ""where you guys can talk with all of us."" I would not begin to know. how to do that, Sweet Home. - [Eddie] We'll have to check into it. - But yes, Eddie and I will. check with our computer guru, Big Mike, that works on the property. Not Michael Gruver, but another. Mike that's part of our team that we couldn't do without. And then the next one is from Shane. Shane asks, ""I love to watch these videos. ""Don't think I've missed one yet."" Well good, Shane. How long do they stay up? - [Eddie] Oh, they're up always. - They won't ever go- - [Theresa] Once they go up, they live. - Yay! So if you miss a day, you can. always go back and find it. (cackling) And this last one made me laugh because this is from Paul Nunya. And for y'all that don't. know what Nunya means, it means none ya business. (laughing) I hadn't heard that expression, Paul. - [Eddie] You should see, it would take me forever to type something the. way he typed something. It's a lot of detail. - He does. He's a detail man. ""I seriously don't know. what I'd do without you."" Well, Paul Nunya, that is so sweet. That is so sweet. And I hope it's nothing. that you have to worry about in the near future. I hope it's a long way off. that you have to worry about being without me, but that. just touches my heart. So I just wanted to take an opportunity, and you know, I'm always saying. Excuse me. Y'all send me one of. your favorite recipes, or tell me what your grandma. used to make for you. And believe it or not,. I get a lot of recipes. And I'm so appreciative of those because I love hearing y'all's stories. 'Cause you know, we all got a story, just some people don't. ever get to tell them. And I appreciate when. we can tell your story. All right, so the cake I'm making today is from Megan Frounfelter. F-R-O-U-N-F-E-L-T-E-R. Frounfelter. And listen, Megan was short. and sweet with her words. She said, ""Hi, Miss Paul Deen. ""My granny used to make a cake. called a pea-picking cake. ""It was the best cake ever. ""Was wondering if you have ever made it, ""and if you would make one. on your Quaran-Deen Cooking. ""Thank you so much, and be blessed."" Well Megan, I have got a. recipe in one of my cookbooks, I can't even remember. which cookbook it is, but the name of mine is pig-picking cake, which is very close to pea-picking cake. Pea-picking came from Ernie, what was Ernie's last name? (snapping) From Hee Haw. He sang, what song was it? ♪ Takes a two-ton ♪ Oh, I can't remember, and. I can't sing to start with. Ernie. It's not Ernie Williams, is it? - [Theresa] I can't help you. - Ernie Ford. Was it Ernie Ford? Or was that a car? (laughing) Anyway. I'm gonna cut this oven down a little bit. So I'm sure that y'all can. probably tell by my clothes that either y'all are. thinking, ""That damn woman ""don't never change clothes."" (laughing) ""She has been wearing that for days now."" Actually, when I come. in here in the kitchen and shoot these vignettes, and shows, I do about five or six in one day. So that's why you'll see me. for days in the same outfit Well, today just feels like. it's Grandmother's Day, so I'm so excited because. in an earlier vignette, I made another cake. that came from a granny. So this one is so simple, and I hadn't compared this recipe, Megan, with the one in my book,. but they would have to be, if not identical, they would. have to be very, very similar. So we're gonna start. with a yellow cake mix. And you know what? You really don't even. have to have a mixer, an electric mixer for this, but I'm gonna use one. just to beat up my oil. I think that was a half a cup of oil. Let's see what Megan said. This is a real moist cake, y'all. Yeah, half a cup of oil. So I'm gonna just use. my little hand mixer. Make sure I get this mixed up real good, but like I said, I could. certainly do this with a whisk, and do it by hand. (mixer rattling) But I wanna make sure. it's mixed up real good. And our last ingredient that's. gonna go in this, y'all, is Mandarin orange. Mandarin oranges. And Megan tells us to only. pour off half of the juice. So that's what we've done. And because these beaters. would just tear the heck out of those little. fragile orange sections, I'm gonna just fold them in. After I get this mixed up real well. (mixer slows) There we go. So just gonna fold that right in. Because see, the only... We didn't have any milk, or buttermilk, or water to make that cake with. So we really needed that. liquid from the oranges. And I do want y'all to. be able to see these when you cut into your cake. Beautiful. So that's it. All right. Megan said put it in three pans. She didn't tell me. which size, or anything, so usually I make a nine-inch cake. But these eight-inch pans were so handy, I said, ""I'm just gonna. make it an eight-inch pan."" So I always use my measuring spoons to try to get my cakes perfectly even. So if I measure the batter, then I know they're all. gonna be the same size. Those orange pieces look pretty. in there, don't they, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - See, just stirring those little oranges wants to break them down. - [Eddie] You said you have. made something like this? - [Paula] Oh yeah. But like I said, we'd. have to, oh, start there. That one's got a lot of oranges in it. - [Eddie] Do the oranges. dry out as they cook? - Eddie, I don't remember. I don't even know if I. used Mandarin oranges. I don't remember. (chuckling) All right. I hope those are pretty close to even. You know, when we get done, I don't think any of my. cookbooks are down here. So we'll just have to go on the computer and pull up. Paula Deen's Pig-Picking Cake and see how much alike they really are. Because like I said, they. could be straight identical. I don't know. But, I sure do appreciate you sending in your version, Megan, 'cause there's always. another way to do everything. This one, this pan looks. a little lighter to me. But you know what? I'm not gonna worry about it. I'm gonna put these in a 325 degree oven. No butt shots, Eddie. No butt shots! (laughing) - [Theresa] Paula, remember, it's 350, but for your oven it's 325. - No, for these, no. - [Theresa] Oh, oh, little ones. - I thought it said 325, Teresa. - [Theresa] Did it? (both laughing) I think you're right, now. that you're saying it, especially with that looking- - 325. - [Theresa] With those wonky eyeglasses, I'm gonna go with you. - Hey, listen, I do what I. have to do to be able to see. (laughing) Okay, Jennifer. Your pea-picking cakes. have cooled down nicely, so now it's time for us to. make the frosting for them. And this comes from Megan,. as I said early, Frounfelter. Frounfelter. (laughing) I'm sorry, Jennifer. I mean, Megan. I was just talking to Jennifer. So Megan says, now here's. where I did something a little different, Megan. It called for one nine-ounce. tube of whipped topping. Well, I personally don't care for the frozen whipped topping. It's great if you're. trying to cut calories or something like that. I mean, it's better than nothing if you're looking for. something that's sweet, But I whipped my own fresh cream, my whipping cream, and I mixed it. I think I probably used. maybe a cup and a half of whipping cream, and put in, oh gosh, maybe a quarter of a cup of sugar. So I sweetened it up because, you know, that frozen whipped is sweet. So that needed to be sweet, too. So, she tells us to add one small package of vanilla Jello. Now this is gonna make all this tighten up and stay on that cake. And it calls for one, let. me see if it says an ounce. Just one large can of. crushed pineapple, drained. And you wanna make sure. you drain it real good, because if it's too soupy,. it won't stay on your cake. We'll let Michael. So we just gonna stir all that together. - [Theresa] It's interesting. how Michael always comes around when he sweets are coming out of the- - [Paula] When it's cakes. - Yeah.. (Paula laughing) Do you have a sense? Something speaks to you from... (Paula laughing) - [Michael] Sweets for the sweet. - [Theresa] Hey. - Right. (laughing) You know what I may do, y'all? Megan just said frost the cake. But you know what? It might be easier, and I. like lots of frosting, y'all. Now I'm gonna put a drop. of frosting right there, so that kinda glue my first cake down and not let it slide around. Isn't that beautiful? Remember we used that. can of Mandarin oranges. So this is what I may be thinking, y'all, 'cause like I said, I like a lotta icing. And I think it would be right prudent. Oh. (utensils clattering) You ever done that, Michael? Gone to slam that door,. and a knife be sticking up? - [Michael] Yup. (telephone ringing) - I know that's a sales call, don't y'all? - [Michael] Might be. your last chance, Eddie. - Last chance for that warranty. Oh no. Hello. (buzzer sounding) (dog barking) Hello. (dog barking) That was the gate. (chuckling) (voice drowned out) With you, Mikey? Ooh, and look at that. Mm mm, I shoulda sprayed that waxed paper. All right. See how that pudding got. that whipping cream so thick? On this. I can't stand it if I. don't have enough icing, so I'm wondering if may be I. could just get away with... - [Theresa] Doing the filling? - [Paula] Doing the sides. - [Theresa] And not the top? - [Paula] I meant the top. - [Theresa] Yeah. I would just do fillings. - [Paula] Yeah, cause I. like a lot of in-between. - [Theresa] And I was. gonna say, that wasn't... The tub wouldn't have given you any more than what you're doing right now. - [Paula] No, no, I don't think so. - [Theresa] So you really. coulda doubled this recipe in order to cover the whole cake. - [Paula] I could have,. yes, to just make sure. Like I said, to me,. the best part of a cake is having plenty of good old icing. - [Theresa] I'm with you. Especially when it's whipped cream. - Yes. And this cake is so pretty. with those oranges showing. (dog continues barking) You know, I'm not offended by this at all. Oops. Okay. Tastes pretty good, y'all. That's a big cake. (cackling) I love your pea-picking cake. Oh yeah. (chuckling) I always get nervous if my icing looks like it's running low. I have had to stop in the. middle of making a cake and make more icing. - [Michael] You need a tester for that? - [Paula] I do need a tester. (Theresa laughing) - [Theresa] Like we said,. it's amazing how you show up. - How does that look to you, Eddie? - [Eddie] Looks great. - [Paula] You got that good eye. It doesn't look weird? - [Eddie] Mm mm. Looks like something you'd. pay a lot of money for in a restaurant for dessert. - Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Thank you, Megan. - [Theresa] Yeah, can. you decorate the sides? You can just put some oranges. or things on the side. It would be real pretty. - [Paula] Yeah. Oh Megan. - [Theresa] Do we get to cut into it? - [Paula] Yeah, we gonna cut it. We can't do that to. Megan and not taste it. - [Theresa] I don't think people. realize in real television you always have all the things made up, but we could never eat any of it because you had to save it for beauties. - [Paula] Had to save it, yes. - [Theresa] So it was just torture. - Yeah, all you could do was look at it. - [Michael] You might have. to steal a piece of cake, Paula, and put it back again. - [Paula] Yup. (laughing) - [Michael] You ever seen her do it? - [Theresa] Only she. could get away with that. - [Michael] Yeah, let's. see how she does it. That's the way you get it out. - [Theresa] Well, maybe we'll. show the viewing audience that one day, but that's not today's... - Well, she could do it. - It looks a little funny to me because I know that icing is. supposed to be on the side. But we won't know it when. it's going down our belly. So let's cut it! Who wants a piece? - [Michael] You talked me into it. - [Paula] Okay. You know this way, you. know how we always fight about the end of the cake? Well, it don't matter. - [Michael] I know. - When I frost it that way. You got 'em, Theresa? Just those little plates, yeah. - [Theresa] I'm just getting the plastic, I mean, the disposable ones. - Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. - [Theresa] One, two, three makes Eddie, and four makes me. - [Paula] Look. - [Theresa] Oh my God. - [Paula] Doesn't that look good? I coulda stood some more. icing right in there. Yes, Megan, the next. time I make this, honey, I'm doubling the icing. All right, there you go, husband. - [Michael] Well, thank you. - [Paula] You're welcome. - [Michael] (mumbling) - [Theresa] No, I do not. - Thereser? Uh oh. (laughing) - [Theresa] I shoulda. taken the first piece. - I was trying to do that. from the wrong angle. - [Theresa] It's okay. It all eats the same. - All right, Eddie. - [Theresa] Yum. It looks so moist. - It does, doesn't it? That's 'cause it called for oil. I love a cake that calls for oil. - [Theresa] You know. what I love about this is it's not overly sweet. - No, strangely, it's not, Theresa. - [Theresa] And the cream is good. I love Mandarin oranges. - All right, I'm gonna try to cut me off- - [Michael] I like healthy cakes. (Theresa laughing) - It's hard trying to cut a thin piece. - [Michael] Usually I like carrot cake 'cause I get my carrots. - Yes, you get your vegetables. - [Michael] Yeah. - That is one pretty cake. That top layer's got a lotta icing. - [Theresa] You need to taste it, 'cause it's one good tasting one, too. - Delicious. - You like it, Michael? - Mm hm. - Yay. Megan, thank you so, so much. - [Michael] Thank you, Megan. - And I will see you next time. Thank you for sharing. Whoa! - [Theresa] It's good. - [Paula] Mmm!";['postres']
MHPldvK7FNo.json;"- Hey friends, thanks for coming in the kitchen with me today, because I'm gonna be sharing a recipe that we probably all had. at one time or another, and we love to eat this recipe. And you're gonna find me in,. say, the next five videos, I'm gonna be making things that I think adds a lot. to a Valentine's dinner for your sweetheart. And look, I'm even wearing. my Valentine's sweater today while I make this. You can't hardly see the Valentines on it, but it is my Valentine sweater, and I wear this once a year, one time a year around Valentine's Day. But before we do that, I just want to remind y'all out there to subscribe to the Paula. Deen YouTube Channel, and that way, y'all are gonna be. notified about everything. If you don't subscribe, then you're gonna miss all the notices. So just a quick reminder: Subscribe. Subscribe. (Paula chuckles) Okay. I don't know if I even. said the name of the recipe that I'm making today, but it's the Molten Lava Cake. And Theresa and I yesterday was thumbing through some of my books, and she pulled out. ""Paula Deen Celebrates."" And you know what? This is one of my favorite books, Theresa. But, you know, I kind. of just forget about it. I have my ""Kitchen Classics"" book that I just, it stays in my eyesight all the time. So I just go to that. But this is a wonderful book, full of wonderful recipes, and Martha Nesbit, a friend of mine, collaborated with me on this book, and she is one talented girl. So the recipe is in ""Celebrates."" I don't know what I did with the jacket cover, but it's gone. So we're gonna make this today. Hope it turns out. You might want to make. it before Valentine's Day to just practice. How about that? So, we're gonna start by greasing our, whatever, whatever kind. of little container that you're using. I've got these precious. little Valentine hearts, you know, that I'm gonna make mine in, but you want to make sure,. because we're gonna empty... We're gonna turn these. over and empty 'em out onto a plate. So you're gonna want to make sure that it's greased very good. And I'm using one for baking, because it has flour in it. So if you don't have that, you can always rub it. with some solid shortening and then sprinkle it with flour. And that'll give you a better chance of rendering a perfect product. So we've got our little ramekin dishes that we're gonna make our lava cake in, and the next step is gonna. be to melt our chocolate. Now there's a couple of different ways you can melt your chocolate. You can choose to do it. over a double boiler, which personally, I think that might be the. most accurate way to do it. But you know, we've gotten,. in this electronic world, so I'm sure that 95. percent of people out there probably do it in the microwave, which is what I'm gonna do today. But Theresa has been doing some research on different chocolates. And I know that you have. to be very, very careful. You can't get it too hot, but Teresa was actually sharing with me the temperatures that. your different chocolates should never go over, and the white chocolate. will seize up the easiest. I think it's, like, no. hotter than 85 degrees. Milk chocolate's right. there in the middle. I think it's, like, 88 degrees or 86. And then your dark chocolate. can take the most heat of all. And that one's 88. - [Theresa] 90. - 90. If y'all are out there. watching and listening, send me different tips and hints that you got, you know, maybe from your mama or your grandmama. I just love hearing what. they call old wives' tales that work! - [Theresa] Mm-hm. - Isn't that great? So share, share y'all's memories with me. All right, so I'm using six ounces of... Let me make sure I'm saying this right. Six ounces of uh... Where is it? - [Theresa] Bittersweet. - This is the bittersweet,. bittersweet, and it is bitter. So we'll start with that. And then we've got... How many ounces does this say? Two one-ounce squares. of semi-sweet chocolate. And you'll notice, we're. not using my favorite, which is milk chocolate, but I am doing this according. to the way we wrote it. All right, so I'm gonna. go into the microwave, and I'm gonna microwave it for 30 seconds. If it's not hot enough or at. the right temperature then, I'm gonna add 15 more seconds to it. What, Theresa? - [Theresa] You wanna add your butter. - Yeah. - [Theresa] This is not actually one of those recipes, Paula, where you have to really be. as heavy on the temperature because of the butter that you're adding, is what I read. - That's right. - [Theresa] It's when you're making one of our other recipes. - Yeah, the butter is cutting. the strength of the chocolate. So it'll be okay. But if your first time. around, it's not right, reheat in 15-second increments, because it will seize up on you. This looks really, really good. And as Theresa was saying, the chocolate that we are gonna do in the next recipe is really gonna, gonna have to be precise on that. But because we added the butter, and I had this in there, I ran it for 30 seconds. Then I ran it for 30 more seconds. And... So it took, like, maybe. a minute 15 seconds to melt this. So now we're gonna add our eggs. Let me get a fork, so I can beat these eggs up. And we're just using yolks, and I'm gonna have to find... a pie to make so I can use. those three egg whites. How's that sound? (Paula chuckling) Y'all picking up what I'm putting down? All right. So... Got those beat up. Now we're gonna add our flour. And I want to get that beat. real well, so it won't be lumpy. (Paula beating up the mixture) Look how dark that chocolate is, that bittersweet, that bittersweet is... - [Eddie] It smells so good. - [Paula] You like dark. chocolate, don't ya? - [Eddie] Well, I like all. chocolate, but, I'm in. (Paula chuckling) - Me too. I can eat dark chocolate,. but I prefer the milk. All right, next, I'm gonna add our... confectioner sugar. And I decided to go ahead. and add these two things before I added the eggs, because it was really nice and warm, and it could have cooked our egg yolks. And I didn't want to have scrambled eggs along with my chocolate. So next, I'm gonna go ahead. and add a little liquid, and that's gonna be in. the form of vanilla. Gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla. Maybe. (Paula chuckling) I got it! (Paula chuckling) You know how they'll crystallize. on that cap sometimes. All right, a teaspoon of vanilla. That'll help make that a little easier for me to mix together. And then I'm gonna add two tablespoons of something that smells so good. Oh, no! Look. My cork broke, Eddie. So... You know, how if you. store wine or alcohol, if you don't store it on its side, the cork will dry out? And that's what happened. So now the cork is down. there, but it's all right. (Paula chuckling) We can pour around that cork. And I'm gonna add two tablespoons of the orange lacquer. Oh, it smells so good. How would you use orange lacquer, Eddie? - [Eddie] How would I use it? - Is it good, fruit soaked. in it or something like that? - [Eddie] I mean, I sometimes. add a splash to gin and soda. (Paula laughing) - And does it taste like an orange? - Ah, it give it, you know, just a little citrus taste to it. - Okay, so that little. bit of liquid helped some. So now in go the eggs, and that's gonna help. loosen it up a little bit. Now I just cut on the oven, so I can preheat the oven, and it needs to be. reheated to 375 degrees. So these cook a little bit. faster than a normal cake. So here's what I'm gonna do. (spraying) I'm gonna spray that, because I want my measurements precise, since I'm having to divide the batter into six different cups. So I want to get 'em... See how that just slid right out, because I sprayed it? Because I want the cakes to be as close to the same. size as I can get 'em. One thing that I really. like about this recipe, you can go ahead and make these and freeze them and then just pull them out and pop them in the microwave just for like 30 seconds, not for much, but just... And that's after they've thawed. Just take them out of the. freezer, let 'em thaw. And, uh... You can have a molten lava cake very often. All right, so I'm gonna. kind of shake these around, get that... Get that batter spread out in there. All right, so we're gonna. put this in the oven. We're gonna bake it for 13 minutes, and hopefully the edges. should be kind of crisp but the inside is gonna be gooshy. So... Don't try to bake 'em until it's... like a regular cake where you can't... where it doesn't shake. Say a little prayer to the baking gods. Ouch. All right, now the. recipe reminds us that... the edges will be crispy, but I think we might need to stick. it back for a minute. And then again, I'm afraid to, because I want the center to be gooey. I don't know if I've ever. told you all this story of my best friend,. Bubbles, her experience... I may have told y'all. Who knows? After 20 years, I'm. bound to repeat a story, but she and Phil were. in this nice restaurant in Atlanta. I don't, have no idea what the name was. And it really doesn't matter, 'cause I wouldn't say it anyway. But she said it was a. very exclusive restaurant, very expensive. And they were kind of known. for their molten lava cakes. So Susan needed to use the restroom. So she gets up without. asking anybody where it is. And she goes to what she. thinks is the restroom. Now this dessert on the menu was like either $19.95 or $21.95, something like that. (Paula chuckling) So Susan mistakenly opened. the storage-room door, and she said it was up to the ceiling with a well-known lava-cake mix that you put in a microwave and... Oh, my gosh. So that may be the way we want to go by the time this is over. All right, my instructions tell you to take a knife and go around the edges, and loosen it. Ouch. So hopefully they'll come out. Oh, nice. And you know, on menu items like that, they'll usually say, pre-order it. You know, so they... Bakin' it hot! Oh, my goodness. I said, only you, Sissy, could... nose around like that. - [Theresa] And not get caught. - And not get caught. So y'all ready? (Paula laughing) This is always the scary part to me. All right, I got to. figure out how I can... flip this upside-down without burning my hands too, too bad. This is not gonna be easy. Please come out. Please come out right. - [Theresa] I see something on the bottom. - [Paula] You see something on the bottom? - [Theresa] Mm-hm. - [Paula] It's hard to lift that up. It's slick... - [Theresa] And it's hot. - And it's so hot! (Paula chuckling) Ooh! Who said we couldn't do it? But I will give y'all this. little piece of advice. When I sprayed it, I used too much spray. Y'all coming home. And too I think our. ramekins were a little big, because it made the heart thinner. So y'all, come on. - [Theresa] And they do. say six-ounce ramekins. I think those are bigger. - [Paula] Yes, and ours. were six-ounce ramekins - [Theresa] Oh, are they? - [Paula] that we used.. - [Theresa] Wow. - But maybe they could have been six-ounce but not as deep. - [Theresa] Yeah. - But, you know. So bon appetit, Eddie. - [Eddie] It's pretty good. (spoon clattering on the counter) - Mm. Michael's gonna go nuts. It's so good. Am I gonna be the only one to eat this? If I am, I'm not gonna. worry about double dippin'. - [Eddie] There's five more over there. - Yes, it is. Yes it is. So this is one of the five recipes that I think that screams Valentine's Day. So I will see y'all on the next video. Love and best dishes, y'all.";['postres']
mp2xxj9uz0Q.json;- Y'all know what. I'm talking to y'all two. - Um hm - Can y'all believe that. we got all three fireplaces running in this house in October? - No, that's a unusual. It's so unusual - We're still usually in hurricane season. - I know. (laughing) Oh, it feels so good. Wish y'all were in here. in the kitchen with me. All right then, I'm gonna just keep on doing pies. Seems like I'm doing a lot of pies lately. But you know, Thanksgiving. is really upon us. So, this is a wonderful recipe to prepare for your Thanksgiving meal, or your Christmas meal as. far as that's concerned. It's very, very easy. I've got my pumpkin puree that I'm gone be adding to our bowl. Three eggs, I think, was that a half a cup or one cup of, of brown sugar? One cup. And then sour cream. A pinch of cloves, a pinch of nutmeg, vanilla, dark rum. - There's your pre. - And don't worry about Oh look Lisa's already got our pie shell baked. cinnamon, ginger, and melted butter. Now we're just gone beat this. all together in this bowl and we're gonna pour. it into our pie crust, and we're gonna start off the oven at 375. And then we're gonna lower it 300 (spatula tapping) until the middle of your pie is set. (spatula tapping) (can scraping) (spatula tapping) This is a pretty color. All right, I'm gonna add my eggs first and beat them up with our puree. (mixture whining) Just wanna make sure. they are beaten up good. (mixer whining) (mixer whining continues) All right, now I'm gonna. add our cup of brown sugar. (mixer whining) This is gonna be a fat pie. It's gone be big. (mixer whining) (mixer whining continues) All right, now I'm gonna add our sour cream. (bowl scraping) (spatula tapping) - It's gonna make it creamy. Let's see, I think it was two, a cup and a one and a half teaspoons, yes, of ground ginger, ground cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. That's probably a pinch. You know, I've got those. little measuring spoons that call for a pinch or a dash And this is the ground clove, and it's just a pinch of that too. Ooh, those got big holes. It came out quick. And then we have our vanilla, our dark rum. And don't be worried. about children having this because the alcohol does cook out. So that's not an issue for your little children. They won't get tipsy,. I promise. (laughing) And then our cup and a half of heavy cream, and that's it. Very, very creamy. And I would make sure, if you decide to make this pie definitely do a deep dish crust on it. All right, so here we go. That is such a pretty color. Whoa. You know what, Teresa? I'm gonna have to get some tart shells, so we can finish using up the filling. (butter sizzling) Okay, now for the good, really good part. It's all good. But this is really, really good. I melted about fourth of. a cup butter in my skillet and I'm gonna add my brown sugar. And this is for the topping of the pumpkin rum pie. And it just sounds like. perfect, for Thanksgiving. - Or Christmas. But I don't know. I tend to think more along the lines of Thanksgiving when I'm. talking about pumpkins. I've already moved on to pine cones and stuff like that by the. time Christmas gets here. All right, so now I'm gonna add my pecans and I'm gone. toss those in the pot. So we've got our brown sugar, our butter, and our nuts. And I'm gonna stand up here and stir them and let them toast for about five minutes. And you don't wanna leave this unattended cause those pecans can, they can scorch on you real quick. So you'll want to stand. right here with them. Okay. I pecan praline, whatever pecan stuff. We gonna pour it out. onto a piece of tinfoil just like this. And I'll let it cool. And then we'll just break it apart, and it'll be kinda like. breaking up a praline. It'll be good. Good stuff. Okay, the last step for our pumpkin rum pie is the whipping cream. Now, I'm gonna beat up one cup of heavy whipping cream. Your timer's going off again, girly girl. All right, get every drop. You know, I'm gone get every drop. Now you can use confectioners. sugar or white sugar. When I'm whipping my cream I like to use granulated white sugar. Because this is sweeter than this. So I just like it. And I think, the recipe does not call for this, but I'm gonna put in , that was maybe a fourth of a teaspoon of rum extract. Like I said, it doesn't call for that but I'm just in a, I'm in a rummy mood. (laughing) (blender whining) My, kind of, own rule about whipping cream is I like it sweet. Some places, these fancy restaurants you'll go to and they. maybe put a tablespoon of sugar in their whipped cream. To me, it's just not good. I think of whipping cream as being sweet. So my kind of rule of thumb is a fourth of a cup of sugar, to one cup of heavy cream. So that one was kinda of. That was kind of overfilled. So that should be plenty sweet enough. Perfect. Yum. So good. So good. Our pies ready, gang. I had to have a lot of. patience to let this cool. All right now remember, when you've got a disposable pie pan take those scissors and just nip it like that. You know, the first piece that you take out is always usually, kind of messed up. But this just helps (scissors snipping) get it out a little bit easier. And then you just pull down on the fall like that. And then you can get your. pie server underneath that. Oh well it broke anyway, but the next piece will work out perfect. So, you know I feel obligated to eat that first piece since it's usually gonna come out ugly. (laughing) - Someone has to do it. - Yes. Somebody has to do it Eddie said. And that's exactly right. All right, so I'm gonna. top it with the cream. And what makes this one so special, is remember those praline nuts that we did on top of the stove? Mm, Mm, Mm And I wouldn't put the cream on until your serving. each individual piece. I wouldn't cover it, you. know, before you served it. Mm. So good. Tastes just like Thanksgiving, Eddie. Mm, so, so good Boy, it was a worth of wait chilling it. Mm. I'm trying to think is this someone in the baking cookbook? - No, that was the. - That was another Thanksgiving pie. - Buttermilk pie you did. - Well this one is so good. Mm Mm. Like those pieces of praline. And remember after I cooked. them for about five minutes I poured them out on tin foil and all you have to do then. is just break it apart. Now I've used cut, chopped. nuts, chopped pecans. But you can use hole ones that would be real pretty too. So I hope y'all enjoyed. It's mighty tasty. I wish y'all a wonderful, wonderful stress-free Thanksgiving. Is it such a thing? (laughing) I don't know. I don't know that I've ever had a stress free Thanksgiving. - Should be for you this year. - Mm Hmm. In case you didn't hear him. Eddie said, this year it. won't be full of stress. Cause we're going to Paula. Dean's Family Kitchen in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. for Thanksgiving. I'll be doing the cooking. in a roundabout way won't I? (laughing) Yum;['postres']
mscgIUa9VFA.json;hey y'all i'm paula dean and whether you prefer sugar or spice i'm gonna make everything nice with some of my favorite desserts that are so delicious but before i get started let's run to plains georgia the peanut capital of the world for some of their freshly creamed peanut butter and then we're gonna head back to the kitchen where i'm gonna put bob's peanut butter pie recipe to test taste test that is and today we're making the cream of my cheesecake crops smothered in a syrupy praline sauce and if that's not sweet enough i'm gonna spice it up with my crunch top apple pie that's sure to please so y'all bring your sweet tooth cause life's about to get even sweeter if y'all are aware or not but i went to plains georgia and had the most wonderful chat with one of our presidents jimmy carter had such a wonderful time and as you know planes is all about peanuts for today's show i think we ought to go back to plains and get some peanuts and maybe even some peanut butter because today it's all about sugar and spice and everything nice just what us little girls are made of so y'all come with me we're gonna have a nutty day today [Music] hey bobby hey paula how you doing again fine it's so good to see you i hadn't seen you since i was here to chat with the president good how'd the cat go oh gosh it was just fabulous hey i'm here for another reason today though i heard about your peanut butter bobby what makes your peanut butter so much better our peanut butter is an all-natural snack him with fried peanuts ground up into peanut butter everything in here is a good plate well i'm thinking about making a pie i got a couple of recipes for peanut butter buys i've got a great peanut butter pie recipe would you share it with me i certainly will we used to serve this in our restaurant whenever we was here in plains so this is a great peanut butter pie recipe you know that you could use if you like well i can't wait to get to my kitchen and make that pie i appreciate so much you give me the peanut butter and the recipe thank you thank you bobby i'll see you next time [Music] well did y'all have fun visiting planes such a pretty little town and the carters are so nice and wanting bobby just cute as a pig's ear i was just thrilled to get his homemade peanut butter but when he said well paula you want a recipe too i said you bet i do baby what a bonus so we're gonna be making bobby's peanut butter pie later on but first we're going to start with a cheesecake so let's get going now we're going to start with graham cracker crumbs and a little sugar and a little melted butter i just love my little cast iron skillet for melting my butter in all right so we're just going to mix that up and moisten all of those crumbs in there with that butter so we're just going to dump those into our pan kind of get it distributed and press it down okay so we got that in there nicely so we'll move on over to the center of our cheesecake and we're going to start with three eight ounce packages of cream cheese this is gonna make a big fat cheesecake all right we're gonna put a cup of sugar and we're just gonna beat this until it's creamy make sure our beaters are in there right and they are now we're going to add five eggs and i'm going to add those one at the time giving them an opportunity to get worked into that cream cheese and sugar all right now we're putting the eggs in it because it's going to make it cake-like because you know we're not putting any flour in this particular recipe some recipes actually call for like a fourth of a cup of flour but we're putting in none in this one all right so we're just gonna mix that up good we're gonna add a tablespoon of vanilla which is just gonna flavor it perfectly and we're ready to go i'm gonna raise my beaters slowly leaving it running just ever so low to kind of sling that batter off of those that helps clean our beaters off now we're going to pour it into our crust oh doesn't that look good it's just as smooth as a baby's behind now we're going to get this in the oven and we're going to let that bake for about 45 minutes and then we're going to pull it out let it cool for a minute and we're going to top it with one of my favorite ingredients in the whole world sour cream so i've got one that should be ready over here for the topping so let's give it a check oh and it is it's ready look at that nice cheesecake and see where it's got a little crack around the edges letting us know it's ready so i'm going to sit it right here while we stir together our sour cream and i wouldn't recommend using a light sour cream i would go ahead since you're having cheesecake and do the full strength sour cream and then we're going to add a little sugar and a little vanilla flavoring and this doesn't require a mixer we're just going to stir that sugar into our sour cream now i'm just going to take this and pour it over the top of our cheesecake and we're gonna run it back in the oven for an extra five minutes so that sour cream can kind of set up on top of our cream cheese now we're just gonna spread that around evenly and that five minutes in the oven is just gonna let that sour cream kind of set up all right we're gonna let that bake for five minutes and when we come back i've got one that's cooling in the window and ready for that sinful praline sauce so y'all grab your cup of coffee and come right back cause the best is yet to come [Music] okay i've got this cheesecake in the window that's totally totally chilled there's a nice little breeze this morning so it is totally cool i'm gonna sit it right here and we're gonna make that sinful praline sauce to go on it won't take it but a minute to make i'm gonna use oh about two tablespoons of packed brown sugar oh i'm gonna do just a little extra and then i've got ordinary corn starch and this is gonna tighten up our rayleign sauce so it'll stick to that cheesecake we're going to kind of mix that together quickly and then we're going to add one cup of dark corn syrup mmm that's gonna give us a nice caramely praline look to our sauce and we're just gonna cook this just long enough for the cornstarchy taste to dissolve and the sugar and while that's getting hot and bubbly i'm going to come over here and i'm going to just do a light chop to these pecans we don't want to ground too fine because you want to know that you're actually eating a pecan on top of that cheesecake just like that that's probably about a half a cup and when we take it off i'm gonna add some vanilla flavoring but i've already got some here that's cooled and ready for our cheesecake look how delicious this looks that caramel in that pecan oh it's gonna be so good all right we're gonna just gently remove that ring i just love cheesecake i love coming to work every day all right i'm gonna ease up there perfect cheesecake whoops that won't hurt it though all right this is nice and bubbly so i'm gonna turn it off all right here we go get set go and you see where i messed up that plate i think i know just what'll fix it we're gonna cover that up with just a little bit of sweetened fresh cream does that look delicious or what i wish you were here michael too bad it's unbelievably wonderful i'm gonna sit that right there and now let's move on to bobby's peanut butter pie i'm gonna take an eight ounce package of cream cheese and i'm gonna give it just a quick little beat to get it creamy and smooth all right now i'm going to take just 4x powdered sugar and add that right now i'm going to cut that off and i'm going to put a cup of bobby's peanut butter in it and this is a natural peanut butter it doesn't taste like your store bought all right there we go and i'm going to just add that to the cream cheese give that a quick whip down in southwest georgia peanuts are a very high commodity in fact mr jimmy started selling peanuts on the streets of plains when he was four years old so he realized the value of this nut very early on in his life now all we have to do at this point is fold it into our heavy cream now if you wanted to i guess you could use a refrigerator type topping but the fresh cream really makes it good so just going to fold that together into that whipping cream and we're going to put it into a store-bought graham cracker crust so we're just going to pile that in there all right we've got this one piled high full of that peanut butter and cream cheese and heavy cream and we're going to stick it in the refrigerator and just let it set up which won't take long in fact i already have one that's ready right here for us to pull out and look at and possibly even sample doesn't that look good it's got a nice brown look to it see how it cuts oh it cuts beautifully and i'm just gonna cut me a little little tiny piece doesn't that look yummy looks delicious and i'm going to sprinkle it with just a few peanuts just a few extra and put me a dollop of cream on it looks like this one turned out just perfect so good bobby thank you gene so much for writing down this recipe for me y'all don't go anywhere because next i'm gonna be baking up a crunchy topped hot apple pie so i'll see y'all in a minute [Music] [Music] now i've just taken my first apple pie out of the oven and i'm going to sit it here in the window and let it cool and if y'all will come back into the kitchen because i want to show you how easy it was to make america's favorite pie the apple pie i wish y'all were here to smell how delicious that pie smells so easy though you can have your one in the oven just in a jiffy i'm gonna start by using rome apples and i'm gonna squeeze about a tablespoon of lemon juice over them to just keep them from turning dark and i'm gonna use about three fourths a cup of sugar and to that we're going to add one tablespoon of flour a pinch of salt and some ground cinnamon and we're gonna just gonna stir that up one of my buddies her name's julia christian uh she gave me this recipe she said paulie you gotta try this it's just my favorite of all the apple pies and i did and i love it because it's we actually put apple sauce in it which makes it so good so we're going to toss our apples into our sugar and flour and get those apples nice and coated with that sugar ooh i can smell the lemon and the cinnamon all right now we're just gonna add our apple sauce which really is just a little different from your ordinary apple pie we're just gonna give that a little stir doesn't that look yummy all right i'm gonna let that sit there a minute because i want to talk to you about your pie crust you probably hear me saying all the time i really love the refrigerated dough now i've taken one section and i have put it in our pie plate and you see i'm using a deep pie plate for the apple pie today and we're just going to take that and pour it into the raw crust because this is going to bake long enough for your crust to actually get done on you i'm going to just make sure that apple sauce is distributed all around there and i'm gonna dot it with some butter just season up those apples just a little bit okay now we're gonna put a lattice crust on this pine it's so very simple we're going to take an extra round of dough now this is on parchment paper so it won't stick on me now i'm going to take my knife and i'm going to run it down into my flour so the dough won't stick to our knife we're just going to cut us some strips now if you like wide lattice you can cut them wide if you like a narrow lattice you can cut them more narrow all right so we're gonna start with the outside of our circle and i'm gonna use five strips now latticing is very very simple i'm gonna pull every other strip back and lay a piece of crust in there and then fold that back over so you see i've got three strips under two strips over all i'm going to do now is take the three strips that are under bring them back and come in there with another piece bring them back over and then do the same thing again with another strip as it looks like it might be hard but it's not at all and we have a latticed pie crust now i'm going to come in and just take the edges and trim them up to fit our plate now before we put that in the oven we are going to make a crunch topping for it very very simple to do we're going to take some flour some sugar and just a pinch of salt and then we're going to cut in some butter until it's kind of crumbly just like we were making biscuits and then we come come over here and just sprinkle this on top of our pie all right now we're going to slip this into the oven which has been preheated to 425 degrees we're going to let it bake for about 10 minutes and then we're going to lower the temperature to 350. but this one in the window should be ready for you and me to taste and you know i don't believe that we can have a piece of apple pie without some vanilla ice cream so you see i got my scoop right ready but i'm gonna go ahead and cut into this one and get it on the plate and while i'm getting this ready i want to tell you how southerners love their apple pie when i was a little girl and my mother would make apple pies she would always pull out the cheddar cheese grate that put it on top of the slice of apple pie and run it under the broiler and we would have cheese topped apple pie that was so delicious but i'm going to serve this first piece with vanilla ice cream doesn't that look good you can see all the applesauce oozing out of there y'all think i got me enough ice cream i hope this is gonna work out right doesn't that just look yummy it's too good and too simple i gotta take a quick break and when i come back i'm gonna share some bacon tips with you so y'all don't leave me now [Music] there's so many varieties of apples out there it can almost confuse one but if you'll stick with an apple that has a lot of sugar in it that will help it hold its shape and for your apple pies i recommend the rome apple the granny smith or the golden delicious all these will work out real real well for your pie and for those big old cheesecakes if you're having a cocktail party and everybody just wants a little bite just downsize them into your mini muffins and people will think you're just wonderful and awfully awfully sweet i hope that y'all sugar and spice day will be as sweet and spicy as mine's been i hope that you'll try the cheesecake recipe just lathered with sour cream and the praline sauce and of course bobby and jeans peanut butter pie is just out of this world and the crunch top apple pie is just so delicious in fact i've got some with some melted cheese on it that i've just got to taste you just need to try this because cheese and apples just go together my mother may not be with me today but she'll forever live in my heart and on that note america i wish you best dishes from my kitchen to yours;['postres']
msKxU1lOmEk.json;"- Hey, y'all! Happy whatever day it is. (giggles) I think this is a Wednesday, right, Eddie? (laughs). I don't know. (in background). - It's Wednesday, yes. (chuckles) - Anyway, I hope y'all. are having a good day and I am so happy that. you've joined us here in not my kitchen, but Bobby's kitchen. Look, I'm already getting. butter all over me. Oh, I forgot I had it on my spatula. So, I'm fixing to share. with y'all a recipe that was given to me by. a very special friend. Her name was Maggie. Her name is Maggie. And the name of this is. Maggie's Decadent Brownies. So I've got 4-ounces of chocolate in here along with two sticks of butter. So, Maggie tells us right off. the bat, this is decadent. So, I'm going to put it in a microwave. And she says, to microwave. it for three minutes. So, let's see what else. they tell us to do. She tells us after three. minutes in there to make sure the chocolate. is completely melted. And we're gonna to add the eggs, and 2-cups of sugar, and a. teaspoon of vanilla extract. (coughs) This is decadent, y'all. - It already smells decadent. - I know it smells decadent,. dunnit? And I wouldn't-- I wouldn't expect anything. less from Ms. Hart. Okay. Now, I added this. sugar first because I-- Ouch, it's so hot I didn't. want it to cook our eggs. So, in goes our vanilla. So, we're going to add our eggs one at a time. Oh, a double yolk! You don't see the double yolk? Kinda like a bathing suit--. suit top, doesn't it? The top to a bikini.. (chuckles) I love that! You know, we don't get many double yolks from eggs that we buy. from the supermarket. Very, very seldom. But when I had my chicken. coop, and look, they're like Siamese twins, Eddie, they're-- (chuckles) they're actually joining a-- they're adjoined. Okay. So, but I used to. get a lot of double yolks when I had my chicken coop and I can't wait for us to get into Dogwood because I'm. going to get my chickens back. I'm gonna have me a chicken coop if I have to go out there. myself and string up some-- some wire. (chuckles) to keep 'em in, cause the raccoons will sure come get 'em, you know, if you don't. find a way to protect them. All right, so, I'm gonna. get a fork so I can beat those eggs a little bit (clatter). Uh, oh. Oh, oh. Butt-shot. You missed it, Eddie. - I didn't get it. - You missed the butt-shot. Okay. I can't get over... I've never seen the double yolk that was actually joined. together, like that. Can't even beat it up. Okay. So, I just want to make sure that-- that chocolate and sugar. won't turn this stuff, scrambled eggs. No, it's all right. It had cooled down enough. Okay. So, we just want to incorporate our eggs in that batter really well. So, somebody told me yesterday, Eddie and I were out running--. running errands. Look at that, that's-- I think that's from that double yolk. And I said, I couldn't hardly. wait to get in our house because I definitely wanted. to take everybody on a tour, to show them what we've been. doing for the last six months. And somebody said to me, ""Oh, I'm so happy to know that. You need to do a room a day."" And I said, ""that's. such a wonderful idea."" Because it would be hard, the video would really be. long, wouldn't it, Eddie? To try to give a tour of the whole thing? - Well, depends on how fast--. - On what? - How fast we walk. - You know I ain't walking fast. (laughs) You know I'm not walking fast. Okay. So, now that's well incorporated. Let's see what they tell us to do next. Oh, okay. We added the sugar, the-- beaten eggs, a teaspoon of vanilla, and now we gonna add the flour and stir to combined,. spread the battery evenly in the prepared pan and. bake for 25 minutes. Okay. So, this is our flour and it-- it is all purpose flour. - Not a lot of flour. - No, lotta sugar though.. (laughs) Yeah, that-- that works a little better. All right, now, it said a prepared pan. So, that tells you that. it needs to be sprayed with something non-stick. But what I did, when I unwrapped. my two sticks of butter, I just took the paper that the butter was in, and I used it to grease my pan. And that worked out perfect, cause I had two sticks of butter and two sheets of like the. wax paper, that it comes in. Now, the thing I do like about Margaret Jo's recipe is I hadn't had-- I have not had to pull out a mixer yet. Okay. So, we're putting this. in the oven for 45 minutes-- for 25 minutes. And I. will see y'all back then. Okie-dokie, the brownies are almost ready to come out of the oven. Maggie's decadent brownies. And now, we gonna make the. frost and it goes on 'em, y'all. And I have to say, I've been talked about a lot cause of the butter I use, but do y'all realize that. Maggie's decadent brownies has one pack a butter in it? It's got four sticks of. butter. You go, girl! (laughs) So, for the frosting, we're gonna melt four 1-ounce blocks of cheese, - Of chocolate.. - and it's-- Not cheese. (laughs) I think I'm thinking. a cream cheese, maybe? This is unsweetened. chocolate, right, Teresa,? - Yes, ma'am.. - That you have up here? - Yes, ma'am. - And then we've got. our two sticks of butter and Maggie tells us, because this frosting. really doesn't get cooked. She tells us, to use that. pasteurized egg substitute. Am I correct, Teresa?. - Yes, ma'am. - When I say that?. - That is correct. - But I don't have any of that. You know what?. - I say we leave it out. - I don't think I'm gonna put eggs in it. The eggs would help bind it together. But rather than me using. my raw eggs that I have, I just don't want to chance. getting anybody sick, you know, with them. - And we are going to eat these. - Yes. They gonna make me eat it, y'all. Theresa said that I had to eat some. - And Eddie and Theresa.. (laughs) - All right. So, let's see. I think she'd probably tells. us this for three minutes again she had a us warm this. Let's see. Three minutes. Yup. It's actually the same amount. that we used for the brownies. We're gonna make sure you do whatever you need to do, Theresa. - I'm gonna bring it over here for you, so it's a little easier.. - Oh, thank you. Yes, because we're going to. pour this frosting on them while they're warm. All right. That's one pound of-- (laughs) Everybody get in the picture here. You just go, Maggie. I'm telling ya. - Yeah. I mean it's pretty. much pure sugar and butter. - Yes. Yes. All right. Well, this is going. to be really, really stiff and I don't think it, the eggs. would do that. Do you, Eddie? I'm gonna add my vanilla flavoring. Give it a little moisture. - So, do you remember her ever baking-- - No. No, I don't. I'm sure she did though. When she was at home, but being our teacher,. you know, we didn't have-- I know some of the girls. used to hang out with her. Some of the kids that were. ahead of us, you know, like if I was a sophomore or junior, there was some senior girls. and girls below us that were really, like Susan, like Bubbles. She was five years-- She is five years younger than me. So, her class got real. close with Margaret Jo. Like I said, she just had. a lot in common with us being not much older than us. You know what, I think-- I think I'm gonna have to put. this back in the microwave, Eddie. - How much egg substitute. was supposed to go in there? - Like a fourth of a. cup, something like that, - So--. - Half a cup. So, that-- that actually didn't get very hot at the end of the three minutes. The butter and the chocolate. wasn't all that hot, so. And I may wind up having to. add a little cream to it. But it's okay. Okay. So, that was the. end of an extra minute. So, let's see what we got.. Yeah. Yeah. It needed just a. little-- little bump. And I am gonna add just a little cream. To make up from us not having the liquid of the pasteurized eggs. That looks pretty darn. good, doesn't it, Eddie? (laughs) You smiling hard, Eddie?. - Yeah, it smells good. (laughs) - Wow. If this doesn't satisfy. your sweet tooth, y'all, I don't think it can be satisfied. (chuckles) Wow. Yeah, that little bump in. the microwave helped it. It just didn't get hot enough. those first three minutes There is not a better word,. for this, than decadent. Taste, Eddie. - Okay, the kitty cat. is like harassing me. - Oh, she is? - She keeps scratching.. - She's grabbing your cord. - She's grabbing my. cord, my leg, everything. - For good reason. Looks so good. And it's chewy. (joyfully exclaims) - Yum! That's like eating fudge outta-- - Oh, it is. It's like. eating a chocolate cake, chocolate pancake in fudge. - I wanna tell, y'all what kind of person Margaret Joe Hart was. She and Bubbles would come over when I first started the bag lady, and they would help me, they. would go to the grocery store, and find my groceries for me. Because they knew, you know, the only money I had was. whatever the children brought in from that day's revenue. And, so, it went on for a. year and a half that away. And-- Kenny, who's a friend of. mine, called and said, Paula the Best Western kitchen is empty. And he said, you really. need to go down there and try to get that space. So, I did. And naturally at night I wanted. to be able to cook steaks and, you know, I had no way to cook them. So, Maggie and Bubbles. was over here one time, and I said, you know,. showing them all around, I said, you know, we should add a grill, you know, so, I can grill steaks. And Maggie said, well, Paula, I've got one that was in the Oglethorpe. Her mother and father owned. Oglethorpe hotel/motel, And Oglethorpe restaurant where. a lotta people went to eat, - Wow. - And she said, I'm gonna bring you over the. one that was in our restaurant. And she said, I want you to have a grill. So, the next time they came, honey, they came loading up that gas grill and put it in my kitchen. So, that's the kind of people that I've been around all of my. life. You know, good people. And-- so, that sums it up, what kind of person Margaret Jo was. So, I send you, honey, love. and best dishes, today. And thank you for everything. that you ever did for me. And especially for this. wonderful, wonderful recipe. (giggles)";['postres']
MyWkHPh6bs4.json;"- Hey everybody, Bobby Deen here. I'm fillin' in for my Mom, a little bit. You know, it's hard to believe, but we're really only about. six weeks away from Christmas. I just, where's the time go, I've no idea. It seems like it was just. the 4th of July, right? We were just celebrating that. But it is time to start making all these delicious side dishes and casseroles, and incorporated fruit, and sugar, and butter and. all these wonderful things that we all enjoy so much. at this time of the year. I love Fall, and this is a very Fall, I'm gonna call it a casserole, but it's a really nice side dish. So, for your Thanksgiving. dinner or your Christmas dinner, or for your next party,. this is a great side dish, a warm casserole that incorporates. lots of different fruits that you might not expect. And also some curry, which. is a little different. So, it's really easy and. let's blow through it, okay? I've got a round casserole dish here, and I'm gonna start by very simply dumping in some canned peaches. You know, we talk about this all the time, and things are not always in season, things are not always easy to find, and I don't mind using canned fruit, or canned vegetables, or whatever, you know, you gotta do from time to time. So, what we've got here. are peaches and apricots, which are both nice. We've got pineapple and also pear. - [Theresa] Yum. These are wonderful, wonderful fruits that I like all of these individually. So together, they should. really be fantastic. And you want to mix it up a little bit. So you've got, and my hands are clean. They've been washed and. I will wash them again. But you want to sort of. make it to where, you know, you got your fruit, sort of, you don't want one big. clump of apricots over here. And one big clump of. peaches you want to sort of get it all married together. - [Theresa] Bobby, do. the triplets like fruit? - Our children love fruit. Yeah, they do. They in fact our kids, yeah. I've got one that won't. eat really neat at all. All she really wants is fruit. So it's funny how three people. can come from the same place at the very same time and be so different. And the child that I'm talking. about that likes fruits. I think our favorite fruit is tomatoes and we've got a beautiful garden at home. We're so fortunate and. we've got cherry tomatoes growing on the vine back. there, not for much longer, but she likes to walk through. the garden and pick them and just eat them right off the vine. And that is a beautiful. sight to behold for me. Okay, so we've got the. fruit in the casserole dish, and now let's mix. together some brown sugar. - [Theresa] This is a. quarter cup brown sugar and a quarter cup of white sugar. Thank you, Theresa. - [Theresa] I'll help you out on this. - Quarter cup of each. And here is the unexpected. The curry. - [Theresa] I love the. way this stuff smells. - It does smell great. - Now that's one and a half teaspoons, but you can really kind of do it to, you know, you can do it. less or you can do more. - And to that, we'll add. some butter, melted butter. - Now Bobby you know what- - Looks like about a half stick. - We need to put our cherries in, too. We almost forgot our cherries. - Uh, oh. Sorry, cherries. Not that you don't matter.. - [Theresa] Look at that. - You know you're important.. - [Theresa] Look how pretty. - That's okay, the cherries. can sparkle right on top. And you know what I'm gonna do? (whispering) Pour in that little bit of that cherry juice, okay? - [Theresa] (whispering) You. can never have enough juice. - Waste not, want not. And look, I'm just shaking. I know I'm gonna have to use my hands. We'll just get them down in there. It looks very, very nice. I'm just gonna mix these. sugars and the butter and the curry together. And make a little bit of, you know, when I look at this, I kind. of think like a crumble. You know what I mean?. This is, or you know what? My cousin Don, let me give. him credit, used a good term. When we were discussing. this recipe, he said, ""It's really just sort of. a baked fruit cocktail."" I think that's a good description too. We gotta lotta good cooks in the family. And my cousin, Don is one of 'em. Our family tree is loaded with good cooks. - [Theresa] I think cousin. Don is gonna be in some videos with your Mom. - Oh, really? What a treat for all of. Mama's friends out there. You're gonna love cousin Don. He's an awesome guy. I can only say one. negative thing about him. And that is that he graduated from the University of Florida. (cackles) And it just so happens that he's standing right over there to hear that. But I got to give you a ""Go dog,"" especially this year because. the University of Georgia is so good. - [Don] They are. And the University of Florida is so bad. I'm not, you know, whatever. Okay. So let's see how we can sort of try to evenly spread our butter sugar. - [Theresa] And there is also, Bobby, a spatula either behind. you or in the drawer. - Yeah. Let me try to just-. - That might help. - Use the spoon and just. spread it around a little bit. Let's just get it all in there. first. Let's start there. Everybody in the boat. It is that time of year. These are the type of things. that we're all looking forward to smelling in our mothers'. or grandmothers' kitchens and all the sorts of things that bring back those great. memories of our Thanksgivings in Statesboro for me, or. you know, down in Albany, where we're from, you know, and there's just, there's nothing like special memories. And as you get older and as. you begin to lose people, you know, those memories. become more and more special. God rest my Daddy's soul.. I lost him last year. And whenever I'm making a good. meal or eating a good meal, I really think about my Dad. and, you know, family and food. These things go together. And it's a beautiful tradition to uphold. It's a good thing to, you know, teach your children how to. cook and enjoy good food with your family at home. We like to eat a lot of. meals at home, we do. My wife and I cook for. our children all the time. And it's just, you know, even- - [Theresa] Watcha doin' now, Bobby? - I'm adding some walnuts. I'm talkin' is what I'm doin'. - [Theresa] You mean some pecans. - Pecans, I'm sorry. Pee-can, pecan, walnut, whatever. - [Theresa] But you could do- - It's pecans, yeah, we're from Georgia. These are good old. Georgia pecans right here. So, but we cook at home. a lot for our family. And I think, that you should too. So if you're not already doing that, y'all get in the kitchen. together and laugh and talk and have a good time. Okay, so I've got my oven. pre-heated at 400 degrees and I'm gonna bake this. for about 20 or 25 minutes. So we'll see you in about. 20 or 25 minutes, okay? Welcome back, everybody. Our Curried Fruit Casserole. has come out of the oven and it just really looks great. It's fantastic.. - [Theresa] It's pretty. - [Theresa] I love all the colors. - It's really pretty. Love all the colors. The aroma is really, really nice. And I'm excited about the curry to see what that adds to the dish. So I'm going to just take. a page out of Mama's book. I'm gonna spoon right out. of the casserole dish here. Just sort of put it back together and make sure it doesn't. look too tampered with. Mm! Mm! - [Theresa] It's good. Isn't it? - Mm! - [Theresa] You're surprised. Aren't you? - Oh, I am. - [Theresa] My Mom used to. make this for bridge parties. - Don, that's wonderful. The curry is really nice.. It's right at the front. You get it immediately when. you taste the casserole, but it is, it's soft. I don't know if it's. because it's been baked and because it's in there. sort of with the juices from the fruit or not, but the curry is soft and it's mellow and it goes beautifully with the fruit and the pecans are a nice touch on top. This is excellent. Okay? This is the first time I've ever made it. That's the first time I've tasted. I'm pleasantly surprised. at how nice it is. Please make this for your. family and your friends at your next holiday event. or your next Christmas party or Thanksgiving is coming up. Man, y'all make this. That is excellent.";['postres']
mzXsXXE9qv8.json;"- Hey y'all! Here in the Dean family camp, we are celebrating with a. recipe that is so deserving, because it's father's day. And it's also the first day of summer. So, you know, there's just. nothing like good old ice pops cold fruit pops to give to the children. You know, they actually kinda healthy. Yeah. They healthy compared. to some things aren't they? [Camera Man] (LAUHGING). Like chocolate cake, or? - But we're doing this,. in honor of our fathers. Because we want you to. have a real cool day. And these are for the kiddies, because we want them to. have a good, cool day too. And that'll allow you. to have a cool day too. So I'm gonna take our raspberries, beautiful, beautiful raspberries, Theresa. - [Theresa] Thank you. All right. And we're going to puree these. until they are really, puree. You know, raspberries have. a lot of little seeds. And so the recipe and gosh I've had this recipe so many years. Y'all in fact, I've made this before for some of my grandchildren. and they love that ice cream. (sink running) So this is a wonderful way. to give them what they want without you worrying about so much sugar. But now this does have sugar in it though. I don't want to mislead you. All right. So, and go, oh, I better get. a bowl, better get a bowl Cause I'm fixing to throw the. pop away and keep the scenes. (LAUGHING) which would be so Paula-ish. So, what I'm going to do now. Oh my goodness. Look at that beautiful fruit y'all. What I'm going to do is. I'm going to encourage, the juice to come out of there. Therese could you pass. me a spatular please? - [Therese] Sure. - [Paula] That rubber one. it says, ""butter y'all"". - [Theresa] Can't think. about what a spatula was. - Well my definition and yours are probably two different things, so. Now to me If our making this. for my older grandchildren, I wouldn't bother separating the seeds. I would give them to them. just like this is pureed out. But since it's gonna be. all kind of little ones licking on these I am. gonna remove the seeds. And I'm going to do that. by stirring and mashing stirring and matching. mashing, not matching. It's coming. So I got every bit of the goody out of it. That is just the seeds y'all. And it's still seeping through there. Oh my goodness it smells heavenly So there is our seedless, raspberry juice. All right. Now I'm gonna add some yogurt. Stir that in. And I'm going to add some lime. juice, got a little tartness And then I'm going to add,. turbinado simple syrup. Now this is two thirds a cup of turbinado sugar and. two thirds, a cup of water. And you just put that on the. heat until that sugar dissolves - [Theresa] Then that one. actually they ain't tell you Paula they'd like you to cool it. - Yeah. - [Theresa] And it has. to be made a little bit. - [Paula] Yes. The reason. it's already been done is because it has to sit, but. at least an hour to coupe. So Theresa did go ahead. and do that part earlier which I appreciate. This looks delicious. I can see little pieces of the yogurt. I know Cloud, you know, with. me living right next door in Bobby's guest's house, I. can see a lot of things that go on and see their routine. and what Cloud gives them. I mean, I got a front. row seat on watching this and I know she him yogurt. every day of their life but they have never tasted milk. She will not give them milk. I don't know the reason. I don't know the reason. And I certainly don't question it but for some reason they get their dairy through cheese and yogurt. All right. I'm going to use my handy dandy little, - [Theresa] What would. you do without that? - I don't know. And listen, it's so old. Theresa, it's getting. - [Theresa] Might have to glue it? Oh my gosh. I can't, I can't stand. the thoughts of something happening to do this thing. I bought it at an antique shop somewhere. I say antique I'm sure it was a junk shop. Cause that was all I did for years and years and years. and years was junk shops. So for some reason, I just. love digging for my treasures. I just left it. - [Theresa] I think a lot of people do. It's the find. - Yeah. - [Theresa] It's the thrill of the hunt. - Yes. The hunt, the hunt. It's all about the hunt. I think I'm going to use my. whisk because I'm seeing pieces of yogurt. And how would it be. happier if it was blended. Better a little bit better. Theresa, where in the. world did you get this. - [Theresa] Amazon. - Look. - [Theresa] My favorite place. - I mean this is so stinking cute. It even comes with a. little, your little funnel. - [Theresa] Yeah. So you don't make a big. mess, but I tell you what old Paula, I'll find a way to. make a mess, I can promise. Whoa! - [Theresa] And there we have it. - See (LAUGHING) what did I tell you. - [Theresa] Now I read a little tip. - [Paula] Yes, well share it with us. - [Theresa] The little recipe. book that came with it. They say you should let these. freeze for an hour and then put your sticks in. - [Paula] That's right, if. you're using a small paper cup that's exactly what you would do. - [Theresa] And then were. gonna freeze them overnight and when we shoot tomorrow. Paula your gonna get to bring them back out again. - [Paula] Yes. So, but. here's the deal y'all. This ice pop get up, has. the lid with holes in it. So you don't have to freeze. them until they're semi-frozen. You just send them through those. slits and it holds them up. I love it. You know, it's the little things. that can make me so happy. I just love this trick. that Theresa got on Amazon. Look, that's got a little. cover and all you do. Let's see, I got, I got two, four, six. What is it? 10. I got nine. I think let's go ahead, peek. Okay. Yeah. And see, by using this little. contraption, you don't have to wait until it's half frozen. because this little top keep some standing up right in the center. I love it. And this is probably going. to take a few hours to to freeze. Theresa did a good day's work when she - [Theresa] (LAUGHING) It was so hard. - [Paula] found this well, when. you found that when you did a good day's work sister. Alright now, I'll put these on our tray because our freezer is outside. So I don't want to trip (LAUGHS) or I don't want to drop this. In fact, I think I'm going. to pass it on to Theresa. She's younger and more surefooted than me. (LAUGHING) Okay. It would be good if I. had set these out a few minutes but I walked straight from. the freezer into the counter. So they'd be a lot easier to get out. If you let them fall for a second. There we go. This looks like a professional. fruit pop doesn't it. - [Camera Man] Mm. - Here we go. - [Theresa] Made by you. - Made by us. It's so tart. So refreshing, very. strong raspberry taste. So if you're not a fan of raspberries you could use any fruit you want. - [Theresa] Blueberries, strawberries. Yeah, blueberries would. be so good or strawberries - [Theresa] Paula questions for you because we put lime juice in there. Would you still keep it as. long juice with any fruit - Yeah, or lemon. - [Theresa] Okay. I didn't. know if there was a, a rule. - Yeah. Just to give it that little tart, that little tart flavor. Would you Like a bottle of my yogurt pop? - [Theresa] I'll take it from you. So never gets upset from the backend. - Oh. - [Theresa] I know. - We're all clean we've spent. so much time with each other. What do you think? - [Theresa] These are so good. I mean - [Paula] you like it? - [Theresa] I was scared based. on your face was I was like. - It was tart. - [Theresa] It's got a good tart to it. - [Paula] Uh huh. Good tart. - [Theresa] It's creamy. - All right Eddie, you can. take a bite right there. (LAUGHING) - [Theresa] Yeah that drives him nuts. - Eddie is so nice nasty. Mm. - [Theresa] That might be a. little too tart for the babies unless they really. - It might be, but they eat - [Paula] So much fruit. I mean they love raspberries. - [Theresa] Do they like lemons? - Mm. - [Theresa] Then they'll be fine then. - [Eddie] And pickles, Olivia was chucking. - Oh they'll be fine - [Theresa] they'll be better than us. - Mm. Oliva is like a fruit. eater you have ever met. I mean, she is. So I'm going to put these back. in the freezer unless y'all want on does anybody here want one? - [Theresa] Not right now. - Y'all want one? You got to do this and you got to get this little contraption from Amazon. - [Theresa] I'm surprised. you finally used it. - I know. - [Theresa] Now I know how to use it. - I know, it's just great. And I know this has got to be better for us than like. - [Theresa] well it's. natural, it's all natural, I mean even if it though. it has some sugar in it. - Yeah. Mm, It's good y'all gotta try it. Perfect for the summer. - [Theresa] Mm. - You can put that back in the freezer. - I sure am. - Thank you, Thank you. And the colors are pretty. Bye y'all I'm going to eat my yogurt pop.";['postres']
N4PFSG8eBkw.json;(bang sounds) - Well y'all, you know,. it's all about Valentine's here at our house this week, and I'm fixing to share with y'all the easiest, hot fudge. chocolate sauce in the world. I've been... I think I made. this for the first time when Jamie was like. six and Bobby was four. It was just always our favorite sauce to eat on top of ice cream. And of course, after you. make it and you've eaten it that first time, while it was hot, you put it in the refrigerator. And when you use it the next time, you can just put it in a little glass bowl and reheat it in the microwave and it creams right back up, so smooth. So, I'm starting with... What did I do with my pot? - [Lady] It's right there. - All right, I'm gonna put one. stick of butter into my pot (metal clanking) and get that to melting And then I'm gonna add one cup of sugar. And then I'm gonna add evaporated milk. And then when I get through cooking it just for a few minutes,. I'm gonna add my vanilla because if you put it. in while it's boiling, the vanilla has a tendency. to cook out of it. And I really want that vanilla flavoring. Okay y'all I'm back. This kitchen is very, very small. So we had to put our. refrigerator in the garage and then we got stainless. steel shelves out there to hold our... it's like our pantry. So I knew I had those chocolate chips somewhere in that pantry. Now I'm melting the stick of butter. (paper rattling sounds) And I'm gonna add one cup of sugar. So this sitting fat in and on y'all. (giggles) Okay. So in that goes. And then I'm gonna add... (paper rattling sounds) You know it depends on how. chocolatey you want it. I'm using a real milk chocolate because... No this is the semi-sweet. I thought I had the... I thought I had the milk chocolate, so I'm going to go back and. look one more time y'all. (muffled giggles). Hold on. All right y'all, so I. got me a cup of sugar, stick of a butter and it really... And Theresa found my milk chocolate. I am not a semi-sweet or dark chocolate... I'm just not a fan. But feel free to use whatever. chocolate is your favorite. You could actually make. it with white chocolate, but I just... I'm a big. fan of milk chocolate. (paper rattling sounds) So that's what I'm using. (paper rattling sounds) And you know, this you just... Just kinda put what you want.. (paper rattling sounds) I'm gonna put... that's. probably a half, yeah, it's probably a half a cup. I'm gonna start with that and. you can come over here Eddie and show everybody how fast this melts. So, I'm just gonna put. enough chocolate chips in this to make it the color I want. So I may wind up in the end... It may be like a cup of chocolate chips but the milk chocolate now,. it's a lighter chocolate. If we were using semi-sweet. or what's the other one? There's a semi-sweet and... I can't remember, cause I always use milk. So that's the color I want mine. So I'm saying that was a cup and I'm going to turn this. up just a wee little bit, because I want that sugar to melt. So I'm melted one stick of. butter, put in one cup of sugar and a cup of milk chocolate morsels. (ticking sounds) But I tell you if I put in... Listen to what I did with it now. (giggles). (ticking sounds) If I had used... Oh, it's bittersweet. - [Lady] Right? - There's a bittersweet. chocolate, there's... - [Lady] Semi-sweet. which is what these are. - Yes, semi sweet which. I can take a semi sweet but I really prefer... So I'm going to put just a. little bit of this in here. Just so you can see the color, how much darker the semi-sweet is. (ticking sounds). (bang sound) Come on, get hot. (light giggles). (ticking songs) Get hot, morsels. (ticking songs) See, because other chocolate is like the color of milk chocolate. So if you like a Hershey bar, that kind of chocolate. you go on and get a straw. (laughs) But this sauce... Okay y'all. So our chocolate now our. chocolate and our butter, everything's melted and. it's coming to a little boil which is what we want. We want to cook for just a minute. And this is where your own your own because I don't think I've ever measured. I don't think I've ever. measured my evaporated milk. So I'm gonna just say,. let's start with that much. And what is that? - [Lady] A fourth of a cup. I think it's a third, isn't it? So see how that bubbles up. - [Lady] It's a fourth. - Okay, it's a fourth of a cup. And see, when you put in that cream It makes it bubble. Look at that. (metal clanking sounds) So it's immediately so creamy. Okay, so a stick of. butter, a cup of sugar, a fourth of a cup of. evaporated milk, and a dash. (laughs) So the thing is when you're... Surely you can't eat. all this at one sitting. I mean I could, but I don't. So when you reheat it you'll wanna maybe just put a little dash. of evaporated milk in it and it just creams right back up. So we're just gonna let that. come to boil and you can see, just that little fourth of. a cup of evaporated milk, how loose it made it. So you don't want to overdo it, but you want that to just. cook for a minute or so and make sure all your. sugar has evaporated and it's not grainy. (bubbling sounds) It's still just a wee bit grainy. So I'm going to add... this. really, really creams it up. - [Lady] So you're probably. at a third of a cup now. - I'm probably at a third of a cup, yeah. Listen to Teresa, she.... (laughs) - [Lady] I am because I'm. one of those precise people. - You are getting there. And I know people like to know, I mean, I know that's a big thing to people, it's to really know the measurements. So... - Yes. - I'm keeping you in check - That's right, I need. somebody to do that Teresa. (laughs) A lot of people have tried. - [Lady] I've been trying for 18 years. (laughs) - Have we been together 18 years. Well, you deserve a medal. - [Lady] It's been a easy job. - You deserve a Ruby on your booby. (laughs) (bubbling sounds) All right, now I'm going. to check for another spoon. (metal clattering sounds) - [Lady] Here's a spoon for you. - It's all right, I got... Oh look, no that's not. a spoon, that's a fork, thank you, thank you. All right. (ticking sounds) - [Lady] Yum. It is not grainy. So it's really better y'all,. if you let it cool some, which you know I don't have at the time. (water splashing sounds) I wanna still have... Oh my Gosh. I love maraschino cherries. And I like them with some on them. See this needs to cool, so the chocolate will stick to your cherry. (water splashing sounds) Good. It would be better. enough if it was cooler. (water splashing sounds) But that's it. And if you want a caramel. sauce you would make it basically the same way, only. you use dark brown sugar. Versus or light brown sugar,. one of the brown sugars. And y'all know my beautiful,. beautiful ice scoop that a friend sent me. I love this ice scoop so much All right. See how it just rolls through there. - [Lady] Mm-Hmm - You put that under. - [Lady] Yum. (light chuckle) Oh, I wish this was cool. (clanking sounds) That's okay. Ice cream is just as good melted. - So we need spoons. - [Lady] Well, we just gave you a spoon. - I know, but we need three, for tasting. And the dishes are clean. here in the dishwasher. Aren't they Eddie? - [Cameraman] Yes. - Okay so... (clattering sounds) Gosh the dishwasher's still hot. All right. Y'all gig in. - [Lady] Okay, poor Eddy in the camera. - Yeah poor, - [Lady] He does get a lot of food though. - He does. - [Lady] We feed him after. (ticking sounds) This reminds me of.... - We're double dipping. What? - [Lady] You know, the. chocolate sauce that you do with and you can scoop your ice cream cone in. - Mm-hmm. - You could do that with. this and it would harden. Cause see how it's hardening on... - I don't know. - [Lady] Look at that though. - Yeah. - [Lady] I don't think you can do it after the first one but I think... - Yeah. - [Lady] Wow, that's good. - All right. Not everybody got a cherry, so... Somebody's cherry. - [Lady] Oh boy. That's great. - Delicious. I love things that are quick. and easy and simple to do. Like Theresa said y'all,. she had been so surprised (water splashing sounds) - [Lady] At how easy it is to cook. - Yes, yes. And you know I tell everybody. if you can read, you can cook. So, - [Lady] And I'm not... I'm an old dog. This isn't like... I'm not. like one of those young whippersnappers trying. to learn how to cook. - Old dogs can learn new. tricks though Teresa. - They can, that's what I'm saying. - So tomorrow, I'm gonna make. y'all a chocolate fudge pie to put ice cream on top of it and top it with the chocolate syrup. Happy Valentine's Day.;['postres']
ne8O9f2j0Ow.json;- Hey friends, today I'm gonna. share a recipe with y'all that might be the best cake. you ever put in your mouth. Starting with a cake mix. Well, the gooey butter cakes too, but that's like a bar dessert. I am gonna share with y'all. a recipe that I've had for years, and it was just. published in one of my, in Paula Deen magazine. I don't know which issue, do you Teresa? - [Teresa] No ma'am. - Okay, but you can,. there's several places. - [Teresa] All you have to. do is gone onto Paula Deen, it'll be on Pauladeen.com. - Okay. - [Teresa] But it's also. on the Paula Deen magazine. - Okay, pauladeen.com or Paula, Cooking with Paula Deen magazine. So we're gonna start with one box of a classic just white cake. All right, I've got my cake mix. I'm gonna add a three. Let's see, a three ounce. package of strawberry jello and I pulled out a half a teaspoon of the strawberry jello. because in the frosting recipe, it calls for a half a teaspoon. of strawberry extract. Well, we couldn't find strawberry extract. So we got in touch with a Baker, a young lady that has. a bakery here in town and she says she just uses the jello, where it called for strawberry extract, so that's why I held that out. So I've got four eggs. A half a cup of oil. Like a, oh my gosh, that. had water in it, didn't it. I didn't see it but that's all right, 'cause this is a dumping beet. So what just went in there was a fourth of a cup. of water with that egg. That's how good my eyes are. y'all, I can't see diddly squat. Like I used to be able to. So we're gonna put, like I say, put all the ingredients in this bowl and then we gonna beat it for two minutes. And then we gonna divide them. up between two cake pans. So y'all won't be able. to hear what I'm saying because I'm gonna be doing. this for two minutes. So if y'all wanna give me. two minutes, that's good. Okay, y'all, I beat this. up, put all the ingredients in the bowl at the same time,. beat it for two minutes. Now, ordinarily I would line my cake pans with parchment paper, just. to make sure they don't stick but my parchment paper is in storage along with everything else. So I'm gonna use the spray. that also contains flour and I hope they don't stick. These were my pans, gosh,. years and years ago. We came out with some bakeware and these are the best. Cookie sheets, baking dishes, they were of the highest. quality and I'm still using them and it's probably been 15 years. 12 to 15 years since they were introduced and of course you can't get them anymore but I'm so thrilled to have mine still. But I am gonna spray it good. (bottle spraying) 'cause I want this cake to. come out nice, nice, nice. (bottle spraying) I had some old cake pans the other day. One of my brands, Sullivan asked me if I would help him make a carrot cake, that's his momma's favorite. carrot cake in the world was my carrot cake. So he came over and I happily make it, and I used, I couldn't. find these for some reason. So I used some that probably. came from the grocery store. When I went to take. Kari's cakes out of there. Oh my gosh, it was the biggest mess. I had to take my hands and. kind of mold those cakes back together, all right, now we wanna let our layers to be perfectly,. you know, the same size. So I start by measuring them, with a one cup measurer. 'Cause it... Didn't make me happy to pull out cakes and one's thin and one's thick. So I am kind of peculiar about this. The strawberries smell wonderful. All right, let's get in there. so I can get me one more cup. Come on, Paula. Okay, almost, uh oh, uh oh. It slipped, you know, I've said for years, when I come back in my next life, I wanna come back as a octopus. Wouldn't it be great to have six arms? I think it would be wonderful. I said I could just see myself. staring up at that stove and the fryer and the oven. and have everything going. Okay, so I'm gonna. Those should be perfectly,. perfectly correct. Now I'm just gonna. take, clean my bowl out. But the rest... Okay. That's good. And that's good. Okay, you know like, getting all my goodie, I wanna get everything. that's due for this cake and that will get it. Now I'm gonna put it in the oven at 350 and I'm gonna bake it for. 30 to 45, 30 to 40 minutes. And this one will take. a little longer to cook because it's just two. layers, instead of three. So I like to, once I. get my cake pans loaded, I like to just drop them and you can see the air. bubbles coming to the top. Okay, kids, the cake is out of the oven and I want you to see how. beautiful they came out. Perfect, and you notice. it's on a dinner plate. That is because Teresa is. gonna take this cake to Tybee, she's got a bunch of girlfriends coming in for the weekend and they gonna. be out there on the beach, raising all kinds of sand and drinking. And you know you will. - Oh my goodness.. - And eating. And y'all will have a ball. I'm jealous I'm not going, but I won't entrust her. with one of my crystal cake. - [Teresa] I don't blame. you, I don't blame you. I don't trust myself anyway. - 'Cause you girls y'all don't need to have to worry about anything just. - [Teresa] Well I'm gonna. tell them I made the cake. - Well you did, Teresa. made this cake y'all. And I've got mine in the oven, but rather than sitting. around, having to wait on that one to bake and cool. Teresa done help me out. - [Teresa] So we're all bonusing, every one of us gets a cake.. - Yes. Yes, yes.. - You get a cake, you get a cake, you get a cake. - Everybody gets a cake. And this is truly one of. the most wonderful cakes. Do you like strawberry cake, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes. - I foresee Eddie having a half a cake and Paula having a half a cake. All right, now I'm putting a half a stick of butter in my bowl. And one eight ounce. package of cream cheese. And let's see, I've got a little. Oh, here it is, I couldn't. see it behind the bowl. And remember the frosting. called for strawberry extract, which I don't have. So I'm gonna use a half a teaspoon of the strawberry gelatin. So was the first thing we're. gonna do is take our butter and our cream cheese. (mixer whirring) And we're gonna whip it until it's smooth and well. incorporated with each other. (bowl clanging) Now I'm gonna add that half a teaspoon of the strawberry gelatin. And I've got a fourth. of a cup of strawberries that we held out from our. frozen pureed strawberries. Thank you, Teresa.. - You're welcome. - [Paula] You keep that eye on me, girl. - [Teresa] I am. - You know, as we start. getting older, it's funny. We almost revert back. to our youth, don't we? In some ways.. - Well, you've got a long way to. - Yeah.. - To be with, I mean, this isn't your. normal environment. - No, listen, I'm so out of place here. I'm so thankful to be here,. y'all, don't get me wrong. This was one of the biggest blessings, for Bobby to have this house. But when everything he got's in storage, it's just hard. - [Teresa] Well the. kitchens your safe place. - Oh yes. - [Teresa] It turned out really be set up. - That's right, but you know, it's been a wonderful little. kitchen, it really has and I've learned how to cook on. - [Teresa] Oh that's right. - [Paula] Yes, oh no. If you'll just help me tell what it is. - [Teresa] What's it. called then, induction? - Induction yes. All right, this was three stops. - [Teresa] That had seven cups. - Seven cups.. - Of confectioners. - [Paula] This is gonna. make enough icing, y'all, we could make some. cupcakes that go with it, but you know what, I hate. standard cake with skimpy icing. - [Teresa] I was gonna. say, you usually are like. - I don't like that. 'cause I like a little. cake with a bug of icing. Okey dokey, now at this point, you can see it's just a very light pink because all we have is fourth of a cup of the pureed strawberries. and a half a teaspoon of strawberry gelatin. So if you wanted to make. this a more vibrant pink, you could always add a. little red food color. Or you can leave it like. this where it's more natural. We have some food coloring? - [Teresa] I know, I'm. in the closet getting it. - All right, you wanna squirt? - [Teresa] Oh I'm scared. - [Paula] Don't be scared. Don't be scared, just a. drop and it'll be all right. Let's see.. - A drop at a time. - [Paula] Yes, I like doing it very slow. - [Teresa] You've taught. me you can always add but you cannot take away. - [Paula] You can't suck. that stuff out of there. Okay.. - Look how beautiful. - Aint it beautiful? And like I said, all of my cake recipes. should be that generous with the powdered sugar, you know, all the carrot cake recipes and any of your cake that does cream cheese icing. - [Eddie] So much is left in the bowl, you use seven cups of. - I used every bit of it, Eddie. All right and how would. y'all like to top this off? You're taking this one to Tybee with you. So how would you like it done? - [Teresa] Just what you're doing. - Faby Crutcher. - [Teresa] So it looks like. that I was really skilled, so however you wanna make it that. - Do you want this down on the plate or do you want it up on the cake? - [Teresa] I would probably. say down on the plate so that I can cover it. Oh no, up on the cake and. that way it'll help keep the. - Okay. - [Teresa] Don't you think? - [Paula] I think. - That'll keep.. - Any way you want it is what I think. - [Teresa] That's what's. always so good about Paula, she wants it to be how you want it, not. - This aint about me. It's about you and your friends. - [Teresa] Well, my. friends, I can tell you are already saying thank you. - As they toast with a. strawberry margarita. - [Teresa] Probably a. prosecco and like a mimosa. Like a mimosa, you know. champagne and orange juice or champagne.. - Yeah, yeah. - [Teresa] But we might have. to find some strawberry juice at this point. - [Paula] Let's see, how do I want that? Maybe like that. - You talking to me?. - Okay, Teresa. There you go, angel.. - Yay. - All right and I put... I put three tooth, tooth, three. - Three.. - Two did. I two put three toothpicks in this cake, so hopefully it won't slide off.;['postres']
nfDnM9Q1Pi8.json;"- [Paula] Eddie just said something that it reminded me of... Who, who did our.. - [Eddie] Our counters? - Uh-huh. - [Eddie] Uh, Ralph Chapman. with Creative Stone. - Ralph Chapman with Creative Stone. I just have to say that. those folks are so good. Ralph really cares about his final product And, um, my first. countertop that was in here he knew it wasn't right. Uh, that the, what hit the did the material done it. - [Eddie] It It was, um,. courtside and it was, it was, uh, warping, I mean, I mean it's a very - Yeah - [Eddie] it's a very. hard stone but it had - Yeah, it was warping. And, um, Ralph said ""You. know we we can't have this, I want the project to be perfect."" So, uh, they couldn't. get him on that stone so they asked me to come out and pick out another one. Is that right, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah, well,. the ones were picking out were were having the same issues. - Having the same issue, so, - [Eddie] So we different, - So Ralph said, - [Eddie] different direction (laughs) - Just go in a all new direction. So, um, seventeen years ago. when we built this house I put in this soap stone. And I liked it soap stone is beautiful. In fact, you can see some of the original, uh, soap stone is in the pantry. And, um, its been there. since the house was built, so, you know what I decided what the heck I'm just going back with soap stone because I know that I like that, and it was good, but, um, when they, when they finished putting it together, Eddie and I looked at it and I said Eddie... that um, (laughs) - [Eddie] Paint color - The island needs to be. painted white. (laughs) And he said, you know I. totally agree with you Paula. Because it was like dark and dark So, we'll get around to. painting the bottom white. One day won't we? (laughs) Someday we are going to get it done. But in case you think, what's different about her kitchen, that's what it is, it is soap stone. So, anyway, um, you know it is strawberry season. Eddie was telling me up where his mother lives in New Hampshire, there's, she's probably got another month before strawberries come in. They have like plant city flora, I mean, the strawberries are just... scrumptious! And, um, so in this issues magazine look, uh, there's a. story about my surprise birthday party that was thrown for me. And, uh, you see on the cover, I want to show you all, is this issue still out Eddie? - [Eddie] It's just coming out right now. - Oh, just coming out, good. - [Eddie] This is... - I don't mean to brag but this is a wonderful magazine y'all it is so so good. Uh, you know, just really. family friendly recipes. So, uh, this is the story on my surprise birthday party. And I want to show you that, that was my cake. Totally edible! And the flowers, uh, I mean that's not glass, that's cake! It's all cake! And, uh, I just could not get over it. In fact, I said, Eddie we've got to save those flowers. So, we took them out and they are know in the china cabinet. You want to show them how, what we did with them, Eddie? (footstep sounds) - [Paula] And the ladies. that made the cake uh, said they would last until the year. You know what, they're not as pink now as they were. - [Eddie] Yeah, yeah. - [Paula] The color, they. they kind of turning white. - [Eddie] I have a. feeling once the humidity hits here they may... - [Paula] Yeah, yeah. - [Eddie] They may be going away. (laughs) - [Paula] But Bonnie Bedingfield, uh, and Eliane Drewin. - [Eddie] Elaine make the flowers and Bonnie made the cake. - [Paula] Uh ah. Yes. So, those two girls are located, um, around the Atlanta area. - [Eddie] I'm thinking Newnan? - Newnan? - [Eddie] Newnan, Georgia? - [Paula] They are so incredibly good! And naturally Sissy Bubbles. Uh, told Michael and. Eddie about these girls and Susan arranged for them to delivery the cake to me. And it sat right over there and I, I just, I was just floored. All those folks surprised me. But I hope y'all can find an issue. And Peggy came. Oh, we had a good time. But if you see this magazine and you interested in seeing. about the surprise party you go pick that up. Plus, it is full of great recipes, in fact, um, I'm fixing a recipe today, from this magazine, and um, it's kind of a salute. to strawberry season. Alright, so I'm watching this over here, this one does not go. all the way up to 350, that candy thermometer. It's so old. But so anyway, this is very very simple to put together. I've got one and three fourths cup of all purpose flour. No, it's self rising, I'm sorry. One and a fourth cups of sugar, but that's divided. I've got one cup over here that I'm going to use later. So, a fourth of a cup of sugar. Into our self rising flour. And, I think it's a half a teaspoon, fourth of a teaspoon of salt. And... One and a fourth teaspoons of cinnamon divided so, uh, about. a fourth of a teaspoon is going into our actual batter. And we are just going. to blend that together. (stirring sounds) (glass clanging) (egg cracking) And we are going to put in one egg. (whisking sound) And we're just going to try to beat it up a little bit in this little bitty bowl. And we've got three fourths of a cup, two thirds of a cup, of buttermilk. (stirring sound) So, we're just going to. stir that all together. I'm worried about my... My oil over here getting too hot. I would fry 'em in my deep fryer but I hate to do that because I don't think most people have a deep fryer, so... I want to do this just like you would be doing if you're. doing it in your house. Plus I'm not crazy about that air, that deep fryer. (laughs) Okay, so this batter's going to be stiff. And, I am, using naturally fresh strawberries for these fritters. (stirring sounds) And, uh, (glass clanging sounds) Now I'm going to fold in one cup of fresh strawberries. That have been cut up and, uh, drained or dried. You want to just dry them off before, you, start dicing them. (stirring sounds) Oh, it looks good, good! And it smells so good! You smell the strawberries, Eddie? - [Eddie] Mmm hmm! - [Paula] All right, I want to make sure I've got everything right, ready when these come up. All right, I'm going to. get me some cold water. (water rushing) So, hopefully, I'll be able to, Okay, so I think, this candy thermometer. just goes up to 300. Which is a hard crack. So... All right, we're going to need something to drain these on, Theresa. - [Theresa] Okay. - [Paula] Um, please. (banging pot sounds) - [Theresa] Do you want something. like this to go over it? - [Theresa] Are you just going to... - Yeah, that that that, would be good. Or I can just drain it. on the paper towels. Okay, and then, uh, - [Theresa] Do you need a. bigger bowl to roll the? - No, I don't think so. - [Theresa] Okay. - I'm going to go ahead and, uh, add my cinnamon. A teaspoon of cinnamon. to the cup of flour. I mean, cup of sugar. (stirring sounds) - [Paula] And this is what we are going to roll our fritters in. (stirring sounds) (spoon clanging on glass) Okay, so I'm going to get my spoon in water and hopefully this batter will come out. all right off the spoon. (spoon clanging in glass) (sizzling sounds) Looking good! (spoon clanging in glass) (sizzling sounds) Oh, thank you, I, uh, this is where I make my hush puppies. If you water your spoon down every time. Uh... And you'll want to start. turning these pretty quickly. Because if you don't, they got top heavy. (sizzling sounds) And they don't want to stay flipped over. So, see what I'm saying? If you've ever... Put up, (laughs), turning back over. These are going to have to stay buddy, on that side, sorry. (sizzling sounds) And you too. Uh, they look so good! (sizzling sounds) So good! All right, now, our instructions tell us to, um, cook them for about four minutes. (sizzling sounds) And I'm going to cook them in kind of small batches so that I don't have to wait so long before I start turning them. (sizzling sounds) Yum! You know what, these would be good with a glaze. That would taste like a. strawberry donut, wouldn't it? (sizzling sounds) So if y'all do that let. me know, okay? (laughs) I'm going to want to know how it turns out if you decide to glaze them instead of rolling them. in the cinnamon sugar. Mm, look at that y'all! - [Theresa] Those are so pretty! - I say its been four minutes. And you can, uh, make these kind of any size you want. (glass clanging) In the book we recommend, just a scant... under a fourth of a cup. Now that was a good bit. Okay, so those should be all I need to be cooling off for me to, yeah, it's cool enough for me to touch. - [Theresa] I timed it. - [Paula] Yeah, yeah, oh good! Yeah, just keep flipping those Theresa, or either change places with me and roll, what you want to do? - [Theresa] I'll flip if you want to - [Paula] Okay. It don't matter to me cause. it's all got to get done. (mixing sounds) Those look good enough to eat! - [Theresa] Yeah. - My Grandma used to make up fritters. She would make apple fritters and, - [Theresa] And you could make this look, could you pretty much use the same recipe and change out your? - Oh, yeah. - [Theresa] First - Yes. I'm a glutton for punishment but I'm going try to finish. Use up all that batter. - [Theresa] Those are beautiful! - [Paula] Aren't they beautiful. - [Theresa] Think the babies will eat one? - I bet they would. If their Momma would. turn her back. (laughs) So I could give them to them! (laughs) I think all the babies would. I know Davis would. Davis has got a sweet tooth on you (Eddie laughs) like you wouldn't believe. He comes in and he says. ""suck suck"" ""suck suck"". He's looking for gimmes. Jar of suckers. (Theresa laughs) I said well I'm your. biggest sucker. (laughs) (stirring sounds) Okay, Eddie, do I have you takers to taste with me? - [Eddie] Oh yeah! - [Theresa] I'll hold the camera. - [Eddie] I think I can hold it. (Paula laughs) - [Theresa] Ohh! He ain't giving up. control, honey. (laughs) - [Theresa] He don't want. his face on the camera. - Do you want a hotter one? Or do you want one that is cool down? - [Eddie] I'll take a cooler one. - [Paula] Okay, I'll take the hotter one. - [Theresa] Be careful. (biting sounds) (chewing sounds) - [Eddie] It's good. - It is good. - [Eddie] Mmm hmm. - So next time I'll try with a glaze. And then the next time I'll try confection sugar. You know? - [Theresa] And blurberries? - Just dusty, uh, blueberries would be one. - [Theresa] Right after Easter. - [Paula] Uh ha. - Mmm, mmm, look at the mess I've made. You like it, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah, it's very good. (Paula laughs) - [Theresa] He can't eat. and film at the same time. (Paula laughs) Loving best dishes y'all.";['postres']

see the recipe so I've got a copy right here so we started with yes uh-huh two dozen Krispy Kreme donuts one yes 112 and I think it's 12 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk and don't get that confused it's not evaporated but it's sweetened condensed and I'm telling you what you could just open that Ken and eat it with a spoon mmm Tang Chuck how many calories do you think are in this well

no that's how that's the icing I don't save you it's nuts from you no way oh I see so that is it and the confectioner sugar that Teresa is thinking about that's the rum glaze oh I do it so she won't look at this yeah you know I thought when bill gave me this recipe that they want enough liquid in it mm-hmm here I'm going Congress how about if I take yeah cuz that was kind of awkward for you nuts we didn't bring nuts bill we need nuts some pecans yes I'm a firm believer that you followed the recipe the way it was written the first time and then you make it your own because you know what I want to do I want to take some heavy cream and pour over that because to me it means some liquid it really doesn't okay we don't cover this weekend phone DeBakey okay that's what I was saying it's been I have not made this since I did it on the show what year without a been Louis years ago yeah that we did huh well we're not gonna we're not gonna put nuts on it we got enough nuts in this room you just

leftovers it's just crazy good I don't know key and when that melts we go slowly and powdered sugar and then we're gonna add rum to taste and this is real rum I would probably use rum extract but it's not it's not that strong because I think about how children know um no you don't make this sauce yeah that's what I'm hoping Susan was a schoolteacher for 27 years so I'm I'm thinking her to know what the heck she's talking about I was in the back and a chocolate Hershey's over here with cinnamon I just went out there she was she was heck no she was actually like but I think she just waked up but

Nm70WHQdhGw.json;"- Y'all know how much I love hearing from all y'all out there. And I really got behind. in my correspondence between movin' into my son's. guest house, and COVID, and trying to get our. Dogwood house renovated. You know, I just got kinda out of kilter. So, I finally finished all. my corresponding yesterday that had been piling up on me. So, if you hadn't heard from me, it's because I've been in a... What would you call what I've been in? Not a funk. I've been displaced, you know - [Eddie] Pre-occupied. - Well, I feel displaced, you know. 'Cause I can't remember where anything is, but 98% of it is in storage. So, (chuckles) anyway- - [Eddie] At least we know were it all is. - Yeah, we know what seven bins, rooms, where everything is in. those seven container rooms. But I think it was just the other day. I reminded everybody. If you had a favorite. recipe of your family's, that you've been eatin' for years, that your family loves, send it in. And I would love to. share it with everybody, if you are willing to share it and naturally give you the credit for it. So, I just love the sound of this woman, Elizabeth Van Winkle. That's not a made-up. name, you'd reckon, Eddie. - [Eddie] No. - Wasn't it Rip Van Winkle Elizabeth, are you married to Rip? (Paula laughs) I bet she's so tired of. hearing that old joke. (Paula chuckles) I never met anybody named. Van Winkle besides Rip. Well, she sent me a wonderful. note, a lovely note. And she sent me a recipe. to share with y'all, and it's called Speedy Pineapple Cake or The Number Two Pineapple Cake. And that would be because. of the number two can of pineapple. So, she said, ""You will not. believe how easy this is. You just mix all this. stuff together, in a bowl and put it in a 13 by nine by two dish and bake it at 350 for 35 minutes."" But here's what she says, ""Note for Ms. Paula, Theresa and Eddie. Throughout the quarantine,. and to this day, your 15 minute show on YouTube has been a bright light in a dark world. I love waking up and drinking my coffee to Love and Best Dishes. I thank Theresa and Eddie, for all their support behind the scenes and getting these vignettes. out to Paula's friends. Yes, a big thank you to. these two from me, as well. And of course, Ms. Paula. for being her shining self."" Elizabeth, that is so sweet. And when I hear things like. that, that was our goal, to have people that were quarantined in an almost empty house, to be able to come in and. hopefully share some laughs and some good recipes. So, this one sounds incredible. So, here we go. The only thing, Elizabeth, that I don't know if I'm. gonna be able to do or not, is you say, ""Put this. in an ungreased pan."" But yet, there's no butter in this recipe. So, I'm just a little afraid it might... (drawer opens) All right now, where's my whisk? Where'd my whisk go? Who ate my whisk? That's a big one. - [Eddie] I see one,. right there on the left. - [Paula] Where is it? Ah, that's my favorite one. it's small and fits my hands. So, there's no butter or anything in this. So, I'm afraid it might stick, but I'm gonna do just what you said. Two cups of flour, (bowl clanks) and you see, I don't even. have a mixer out y'all. Two cups of sugar. I'm just gonna take my whisk. and whisk that together. She said, ""Just mix all the ingredients and pour into an. ungreased nine by 13 pan."" Okie doke, our two eggs, our baking soda. So, we just wanna whisk. those eggs up a little bit and then we're gonna add our 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple. Juice and all. (ingredients squishing) - I don't think you can. get any easier than this. Do you Eddie? - [Eddie] Mm-mm. (ingredients squishing) - Look at that it's done. - Now, I just gotta figure out how to get that gunk out of the whisk. I should not have put. that back down in there after I started adding my wet ingredients I should've just used that. strictly for the dry ones, but I didn't. Sometimes, I get ahead of myself. (Water running) So we got our oven pre-heatin' to 350, This wooden spoon'll get it mixed up good. (ingredients mixing) Perfect, okay, so where is our dish? Right here. Okay, so (chuckles) to. grease or not to grease? Elizabeth- - [Theresa] We have problems. with things stickin'. - Yes we do, but you know what? I trust her. So, I'm just gonna go for it. - [Eddie] Maybe the pineapple. adds extra moisture. - [Paula] That's what I'm thinkin'. Maybe that pineapple does somethin' crazy. And if it sticks only me. this time, then next time... But, you know, I tell y'all,. when you get a new recipe, and somebody shares a recipe with you, do it just like they say to do it. And then if you wanna change something', change it on that second round. So, there we go, 35 minutes, 350 for... Yeah, 35 minutes. I think I said it. So, Elizabeth, can't wait to taste your. quick and easy pineapple cake. Elizabeth Van Winkle sent me a recipe, that her family has made forever, The Quick Pineapple Sheet Cake. And now, I'm fixing to make the dressing, I mean the frosting,. (chuckles) this ain't no salad. I'm fixing to make the frosting to go on top of this quick pineapple cake. So, I'm gonna start by beating up one 8 oz package of softened cream cheese and one stick of butter. So, this is gonna be a really, what can I say, a really. intense cream cheese icing. Because we're only adding. one cup of powdered sugar. Where normally, for an 8. oz stick of cream cheese, you would use a one-pound bag, which is like, three and. half cups of powdered sugar. So, like I said, it's gonna. be a rich, intense flavor with the cream cheese. All right, so I'm just. gonna set that to the side. Uh-oh, I'm just gonna set. that to the side y'all. And when our cake comes out, I'm gonna try to cool. it rather quickly and- - [Theresa] We'll be back. - That is so good. I mean, it's really intense. You know, it reminds me of like, those cream cheese. rolls that you get, you know, that have cream cheese in the center. A cream cheese Danish. - Yeah.. - Yum. (Paula laughs) - That's what it reminds me of because it's really cream cheesy. Okie doke, so we'll get back together in, not too long, maybe 30 minutes. Elizabeth, I wanna go ahead. and just speak for everybody, thank you so much for sharing. this easy recipe with us. I mean, I've never thrown. a cake together that quick. And the icing looks just delicious. Now, we have let the cake cool and we're putting that wonderfully rich cream cheese icing on it. I'm just gonna spread that. And the cake is still just a. little bit warm underneath. So, I'm gonna put this. icing on it very quickly. And then I'm gonna put it. back in the refrigerator, so it can finish cooling. But not before I give it. just a wee little taste. (Paula chuckles) Right gang? - Yeah.. - Uh-huh! - [Paula] It's funny, if. you wanna see Theresa, just get to the end of a recipe. (Paula laughs) And you see where she's standing, Eddie? (Theresa laughs) - [Theresa] Especially the sweet ones. - [Paula] You wanna show everybody else where she' standing? - [Eddie] She's standing. behind me, after me, after I get my bite. - You can have your bite first,. especially on the sweets. - [Paula] That's where. I can find her, yes. 'Cause she likes a sweet as good as I do. (Michael speaks in background) What Michael? - [Theresa] He's bein' ugly. - [Paula] Well- - [Theresa] Yum, that looks good! - [Paula] I mean, it looks so good! - [Theresa] And it was so easy. - [Paula] So easy! I mean, when you don't. have to use a mixer, that is a bonus. - [Theresa] And besides,. probably crushed pineapple, most of that would be in your pantry. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Theresa] So, if you. just kept the fruit? - [Paula] Yeah. - [Theresa] Can, you'd be good to go. - [Paula] You could probably. open my pantry and find- - [Theresa] Crushed- - [Paula] Find some. pineapple in there, yes. 'Cause you never know. when you're gonna need something like that. So, what do you think Elizabeth? Did I do you right, girl? Beautiful, (chuckles) delicious! (Paula laughs) Poor Michael, I think he's mad. - [Theresa] He can't have any cake. - [Paula] Mm- hm, he can't have any cake. (Paula and Theresa giggle) (Michael sniffles) Oh, he's crying y'all (chuckles). All right, Theresa, there you go. - [Theresa] Oh my gosh. See, and I like it bein' just a teen- Oh, it's not that warm. - [Paula] Eddie. - [Theresa] Oh, my God, this is good. - [Paula] Is it good? - [Theresa] It's so moist. - Well, I'm fixin' to find out. (Michael sniffles) You've got to stop cryin' over there. (Theresa laughs) Show 'em what he's doin', Eddie. (Michael sniffles) - [Theresa] He's still crying (laughs). - [Eddie] Well, that's. self infliction there, so. - [Theresa] The bomb, is this just not... and it caramelizes. - Thank you girl. Thank you, Elizabeth Van Winkle. This is... Just cover your ears, Michael. This is freaking out of this world. That's all I can say. - [Eddie] Yeah, great flavor. - How'd it get so moist with no butter, oil, or nothin'? - [Eddie] It reminds me of. that, on Steel Magnolias, that cup a, cup a, cup a. recipe that she talks about. Cup of fruit cocktail, cup. of sugar, cup of flour. (Paula and Eddie laugh) - Well-. - That's amazing. Thanks, thanks, thanks. - Elizabeth, thank you. You know, when somebody. shares a recipe with me, I'm always think, oh, well gosh. Wouldn't some so and so,. so, so, be good to it? No, honey. This one's perfect just the way it is. So, thank you honey. And you know what, it's not that sweet. - [Theresa] No, it's good. - It's not overpoweringly sweet. And it didn't stick, y'all. And I didn't spray it. - [Theresa] She knows her thing. She said that they've been. making it for 60 years. It's pretty tried and true. - Thank you, honey. That's all I got to. say, ain't go no words. But you are wonderful. You is wonderful!";['postres']

NUAxkVYzItY.json;"- Happy Halloween. I'm going to be in this. kitchen for a solid week, the week of Halloween to make all these Halloween goodies. And I'm hoping that all. your little children are with your mama or daddy or your grandma and your granddaddy and you're watching so that. you can make these recipes with your family. Okay. This week I'm Paulaweena. And these glasses won't stay on my face so I'm going to take them off. And you know what we're fixing to do kids, you know at Halloween,. you get so much candy and you have candy left over don't you? Well, Paulaweena is. gonna show you what to do with that leftover candy. So you won't have to eat. it like all at one time. And somebody passed this recipe on to me I can't remember who it. was or where it came from, but it's a great way to. use up the leftover candy. So we're going to start, excuse me. The fog is getting to my throat. Wonder if it's real frog in there. I don't know. It's Halloween it could be. I'm going to start with. one stick of butter and like a half a cup of brown sugar. And you'll want to make. sure that your butter is kind of at room temperature,. softened a little bit. So we're just going to, make sure we beat this very, very well and incorporate our brown. sugar into our stick of butter. (mixer whirring) We want it to get really creamy. (mixer whirring) And then the next thing. we're going to add kiddos, is an eight ounce package. of softened cream cheese. I hope before the Halloween week is over that I can show you how. to make the neatest goblin and you use cream cheese for the goblin. My little ones love it. (mixer whirring) So y'all can see this is. going to be pretty soft. And the hardest part for. y'all is going to be waiting because going to have to. put this in the freezer for an hour and a half and let. it get really, really hard. All right, so there's a. half a cup of peanut butter and a teaspoon of vanilla and we're going to mix. that in really, really good with our cream cheese. Doesn't that look great? Now we're going to want. to take our spatula and come around our bowl and push all that down into the center so we can get every drop. of it mixed up real good. (mixer whirring) Now we're going to add our powdered sugar. I think it was like a cup and a half. Let me taste. (Paulaweena laughing) That's very good. (mixer whirring) I'm just trying to sling our cheese ball off of our beaters. That way I don't feel. compelled to have to eat it off the beaters, which is good. Now we're gonna stir in. You know those little buttercups, those little Reese's butter. cups that we had leftover. Well, we have chopped ours up and now we're going to stir it in to our cream cheese and. peanut butter mixture. Now here's the hard part. You see how soft this is. You could not even begin. to put it in a ball. It would stick to your. hands and be all messy. So we're going to have to cover this and put it in the freezer. for like an hour and a half. We're going to get it,. let it get real firm and then we're gonna. make this into a ball, and I've got another one. of our leftover candies that we're going to finish it of with. Okay, so our leftover. Halloween candy cheese ball. Now we had this in the freezer really for hour and a half I think,. wasn't it Theresa longer? - [Theresa] Yes.. - All right. So my hands, the warmth of my hands is helping to mold this into. a nice ball and it's sticky. So what we're going to do, 'cause I told you, I said, ""We got one more. leftover Halloween candy that we're going to use."" And this is our Reese's pieces. I'm going to have to wash my hands so I don't get this all. over our Reese's pieces. Reese's pieces (laughs). The older I get the harder. my tongue has to work. Alright, let's leave out that one. This will help me, doing it this way. So we're just going to take our ball and roll it all in our Reese's pieces until it's totally covered. And I'm helping it along. I'm kind of sticking them on. This is going to be one. pretty cheese ball kids. Theresa, we may need some more. - [Theresa] I got some-- - M&M is good. Uh-oh. They're hitting the thrower. Thank you girlfriend. Ain't that pretty? Looking so Halloweeney. Do I have it all covered. daddy, can you tell? - [daddy] That looks a bit (mumbles). You got a few spots on the bottom. - Few spots. - [Theresa] Yeah you might want to just-- - Oh yeah. Yeah, I see them now. Am I getting it? - [daddy] You look set. - Is your ball covered? - [daddy] I'm the dig in. - Yes. Alright. Now what are we going to put this on? Do we need a plate to put it on or just do it just like this? - [Theresa] This will be a cheese ball-- - How is that? - [Theresa] This will be a. cheese ball the kids will want. You know, some children. don't want cheese balls, but this one I think going to be-- - Y'all come get your bite. It's the first sweet. cheese ball I've ever had, but I tell you this, I don't. think it's going to be my last. This is my (mumbles) glasses. One of my ears is lower than the other. (laughing) Happy Halloween y'all.";['postres']
NVXCm3XnBlM.json;- All right, today, I'm going to make one of our favorite desserts and y'all probably have. made them in the past. But for those of you who. have not ever made them, I want to give y'all this recipe and we're going to start. with two cups of flour, and that would be all purpose. - [Theresa] What are we are making? - We are making lemon bars, and about a teaspoon of salt, and a cup of confectioner sugar. And I'm gonna just stir that up and then we gone cut in two. sticks of softened butter. So this is truly like a butter crust. And we're going to bake this. off for about 15 minutes after we get the butter cut in. See how nice and soft that butter is? It's just going to cut right. into that flour and that sugar. This just reminds me of. some kind of French pastry, you know, 'cause you're. not stingy with the butter, but yet it's not a real sweet because a cup of. confectioner's sugar is to me, not nearly as strong or as sweet as a white granulated sugar. Okay. It's getting in there pretty good. All right, we might be to a point where I could kind of. start stirring and mashing. Yeah, 'cause that butter is so soft. I'm gonna go in like this. and the warmth of my hands is gonna help soften. that butter even more. Hm. You know, these, these. things are our best tools, they're our best tools we got. All right. It's coming together. Look at that beautiful. crust we getting, Eddie. Perfect. All right, probably, I'm probably gonna need to dip my fingers in some powdered sugar so the crust won't stick to my fingers. - [Theresa] How about I help you out and put some of this in here. - Okay. - [Theresa] I'll put. it in this little bowl instead of you having to put. your whole hands in there. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Now we're just going to. transfer that to our 13 by nine. And I'm not gonna butter this because there is two sticks. of butter in that dough. So I don't think we're. gonna need any more butter. So this is going in the oven. at 350 for 15 or 20 minutes. And after that's cooked, we are gonna come back and do the topping for it. And then we'll put that on and we will bake it. another 15 or 20 minutes. So all total, it'll bake about 45 minutes. Just want to make sure. that's flat and even. That's it, we're halfway. there to lemon bars y'all. So, we are ready now to make the filling for our lemon bars y'all and you can see this beautiful crust and I've let it cool down. actually for a minute and it's going to be wonderful. And this is so easy. All we're going to do is add. two cups of granulated sugar. I can't remember how much plain flour. - [Theresa] Six tablespoons. - Six tablespoons? Okay, six tablespoons of plain flour and that's gonna get this, will kind of set up, you know? All right, and we're also putting in six tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Now I know you can buy. that lemon juice, you know, in that, it looks like a lemon. and, but don't, don't use, don't use that, take the time to just. juice you some fresh lemons because it makes all the. difference in the world y'all. All right, now we're. going to add four eggs and we're just gonna pour. this on top of our crust and we're gonna put it. back in the oven y'all. Look, any other time, those yolks would break and. be all over the place, look. I'm gonna have to just stomp them. So, we're gonna pour. this on top of our crust and then we're gonna put it in a, I think, I think I said 350 degrees, and that, the egg in. this is going to call, cause that to, to bake. up nice and custard-y. And you know, if you wanted to, you could grate up some fresh lemon to put on top. of it, but there we go. In the oven, 25 more minutes. No butt shots, Eddie. Well, y'all our lemon bars look fabulous. So I just took those out. and they're piping hot so I'm going to dust them. with a little powdered sugar so they won't feel so naked. Don't want them to feel naked, do we? Theresa just said this is. one of her favorite desserts and they're so easy. I don't know if they're. going to cut, Eddie, with it being this hot. I'll try. - [Eddie] Yeah, I mean this. is kind of a chilled dessert. - [Paula] Well, you just want to cool so you can cut it, you know? - [Theresa] Oh, look at that. - [Paul] Look at that. Clean as a whistle, it came out, but they may be, Theresa come on in and help me. taste your favorite dessert. Okay? - [Theresa] I don't have. a problem doing that. - It's gonna be boiling. hot, but so, so good. - I love the creaminess. - There, you wanna cut it? Don't burn yourself now, it's hot. Is it good? - So good. I love the crunch 'cause it's got the crust and the top. - Are you gonna share a bite with me? - No. - I just want a little tiny. bite and the rest is yours. - [Theresa] Oh, that fresh lemon it makes such a difference. - I know. - [Theresa] People don't realize that. - That artificial lemon is the worst. - [Theresa] I mean, it's. good if you're in a pinch and I mean, but you can. definitely tell the difference. - You'd have to be in a bad pinch. This is like, it's like candy where it cooked around the edges. Now, if you wanted a thicker lemon square, you would cook this in an. eight by eight or nine by nine, if you like thicker, but. this is pretty rich so, 'cause of that two sticks of. butter in the crust, right? - [Theresa] My kinda dish. - If you've never had one,. you gotta try it y'all. Love and best dishes.;['postres']

okdFF5NDGYw.json;- Hey, y'all I'm Jamie Deen, back in mama's kitchen, bringing you delicious, easy recipes that you could share with your family, or don't share 'em with nobody. Doesn't matter to me. They're all good. Today, we're doing old school popcorn. I've got one tablespoon of oil in here. I'm gonna add half a. cup of popcorn kernels. When's the last time y'all. did this at the house? It's been a long time since I have, but we're doing a. special flavored popcorn, cuz popcorn is good and. special flavors is good too. Now you can stay just. as long as you'd like I'll be staying here for. the next few minutes, doing this, that's not irritating at all! So how have y'all been doing? Pretty good? Actually, I'll see y'all in a few minutes when my popcorn's done, okay? Poppy pop pop! I had so much fun. popping my popcorn y'all, and it turned out good. I didn't burn one piece. So to finish this popcorn what I'm doing is I'm melting some butter and it's got just long enough for me to show you the ingredients that we're gonna be putting. on our popcorn today. So I'm starting with granulated sugar. We're gonna add some cinnamon, I've got some cardamom. And I also have, what was my other weird thing that I had? - (Paula) Ginger. - (Jamie) Ginger, ground ginger. And then some salt. Now this is where y'all. have to decide what kind of popcorn you're making. You can put red pepper in here. It's not a little amount of red pepper that the recipe calls for. So if you want that spice,. go ahead and put it in. But folks around this house don't really eat a lot of. spicy unless Peeps is here. And I think he's working today. So I'm gonna leave out the cayenne pepper, but you can add it. Let me get a little tool. This will work. I'm gonna turn my butter. off before I burn it. I'm gonna mix up these dry ingredients. Now don't knock it 'til you try it. And I know there's some flavors in here, you're like ginger, on my popcorn, with sugar? - (unknown woman) Well,. the name of the recipe is Snickerdoodle. - (Jamie) Snickerdoodle Popcorn, nothing to complain about there. All right, so I'm gonna drizzle. our butter over our popcorn. And this is really, don't get too stressed out about this cuz I know you want to coat every kernel because that's what I'm. standing here thinking how can I hit every kernel, but we're gonna stir it up. So just do your best to spread it around. And then I'm gonna take. our seasoning here. - (unknown woman) Yum. - (Jamie) Mama's sitting right over there eating the French toast. that we made earlier. - (Paula) Hot, hot,. and making my nose run. - (Jamie) Really, really good. - (Paula) Mm! - (Jamie) Oh are you tasting. the spice that I put in there? - (Paula) Mhm. - (Jamie) All right. - (Paula) Mm! Mm mm mm! - (Jamie) Well, how about that? Y'all are watching one recipe, getting a live review of another recipe, and then I've got.. - (Paula) I'm having french. toast and a glass of milk. So good. - (Jamie) Toss this to coat. And if you want to jack up. your butter quoting on here, you certainly can. This, I used a very little bit of oil, which is good to know. Cuz if you want a popcorn bags. or something for your kids and don't want 'em super, you know, loaded down with buttery things, this is a good way to make popcorn. Cause it's pretty dry. If you want to, you can add. a bit more butter in here. Snickerdoodle Popcorn. Put a little in this. bowl so we can see it. I love popcorn, I always have. And playing with different. flavors of popcorn is fun too. And there's a lot of. big business around town that's developed all these crazy flavors you could put on popcorn. So don't let me tell you. what to put on your popcorn. You decide for yourself. You might wanna start. with Snickerdoodle though. I'm Jamie Deen. This is good popcorn. We'll see y'all around the kitchen. (Paula clapping in the background) Thank you mama, thank you mama, Thank you, thank you.;['postres']

oh gosh son i can't remember my my memory is not that good you know is it a family recipe or something that you found i can't remember if a family member gave it to me or a friend but this one's been in the files a long long time let me help you yeah well i got it now but yeah you can finish finish up with that here you may want to use this on it so how's our little jack doing he's great isn't he

birthday coming up won't be long and um y'all have not given him really anything sweet to eat yet have you no no sugars yet no sugar and he's gonna be allowed to to dive into his birthday cake on his first birthday ethnicity yes i can't hardly wait he's gonna love it he's a dean he's gotta love it all right so it's just that simple so we've poured that into a 13 by nine by two prepared pan we greased it and floured it and so now it's going to go in the preheated oven at 350 degrees and we're going to bake it for like 25 minutes and this is going to be the best moist chocolate cake you've ever put in your mouth gonna put icing on it oh it does a fat puppy poot yes we're gonna put it uh we're gonna put a fabulous chocolate icing and look at my squirrel now what is that this man made it for me look see you pull it out and then push it in this just helps so much all right son you were asking if we were gonna put an icing on it chocolate icing yeah yeah it's like a fudge icing so to make our icing sun we're gonna i don't know if you've noticed butter but yeah this actually has two sticks of butter in it one uh just to stick in the cake and a stick in the frosting all right so so we're gonna add about three tablespoons of cocoa now i don't like a real real dark heavy chocolate i'm one of those folks that likes more of a milk chocolate so i'm going to add a fourth of a cup of milk and we're just going to let this come to a bowl and when we come back i'm going to add the sugar and what are we going to do when we get back i'm going to teach you something what you going to teach me bobby and i have come up with a truffle pie recipe that's pretty good that we got from colorado that's true sweets for the sweet oh i got the sweetest boys y'all i'm a lucky lucky chick we'll

about wonderful sweet dishes today now i'm finishing up the icing jamie for our cake now i've melted our chocolate and our butter now i'm gonna add confectioner's sugar all right i've melted the butter the cocoa now i'm just gonna add the sugar here you wanna beat that for me you know it might have been a good idea to sift it so it won't be lumpy but since i got a strong guy in the kitchen today so jamie let me get our cake out of the oven and what'd you tell me that you were gonna make bobby and i have come up with a truffle pie we went to colorado we worked it uh with a guy named william poole at wins chocolates he does beautiful chocolates we were so surprised when we got there he had truffles called the savannah truffle with uh but out there they cooked with a lot of peppers and paprika it was spicy and he put dried mangoes on top of it all right while you're telling me about that i'm just gonna pour some marshmallows all right add your cup of pecans into this icing uh-huh there you go whoa look at the mess you made my nuts are everywhere this looks good uh-huh all right now son just take that and pour that over your cake this is like a rocky road that doesn't look too bad no scrape it scrape it son all right there we go son okay now that i've got this heavy cream heated mom what i'm going to do is pour it over these six ounces of semi-sweet chips okay and i'm gonna let this melt your chocolate i'm gonna melt it down i'm gonna smooth this around son and then i'm gonna let it sit and we'll come back and taste it in a minute after that chocolate icing has uh had a chance to work on those marshmallows all right so what a good idea this is yeah the hot cream melted that chocolate uh-huh i i can taste oh yum and they're great now bobby and i would kind of do things a little bit easier so you'd make a homemade but we're using a store bought i use a lot of these but bobby and i we're kind of doing things a little bit simpler so instead of fooling with making a homemade graham cracker crust we just buy one these are so easy to use i'm going to spread this in here so see this is kind of like a pudding uh-huh but we're going into the freezer with it uh-huh now let's hope i've got room in my freezer this will only take about probably 20 minutes to set gosh that's so good and look at this so now what we've got is a solid layer it's like a piece of fudge okay mom this is the second layer and this is almost the same as the first it's a melted six ounces of semi-sweet chips it's got heavy cream in it but a little bit of vanilla what we're going to do different to this is i'm going to put it in a chill bowl and we're going to whip it to get some air in it and it's almost the same but it'll set up different i think this this layer has a little bit more heavy cream maybe than than your first layer i think so we're gonna oh that's good yeah put it in this chill bone we're just gonna pump some air into it sounds good boy this is for a real chocolate lover yep this is the real deal this would be really good for mine the bottom layer is more of a solid chocolate this center section is going to be almost like a mousse this is real real chocolaty it's a chocolate truffle pie mama is what it is and there's there's no sugar in it yet so well using the semi-sweet chips it's really ready to eat now instead of having to put a bunch of sweetener in it it's not like you were working with the cocoa so we're going to spread this out and i'm gonna wrap this up with saran wrap looks very good i'm gonna wrap this up mom and stick it into the fridge for overnight okay while you're doing that i'm gonna cut us a piece of our cake that's been kind of sitting here doing its thing look at those marshmallows they've melted yum look at this y'all i'm swallowing hard look at that wet cake come on mom i enjoy wet cake you want to share yourself with me not really with melted marshmallows [Music] we need some milk when you put that in the freezer grab us a glass of milk and i'm gonna clean up when we come back i'm gonna be making a georgia cookie candy i'm gonna finish this truffle pie too y'all stick around and later a vanilla

gonna give that a little squirt so that peanut butter will come out easily i see your sifter you want me to finish this yeah i've got three cups of confectioners sugar and i'm measuring out one cup of crunchy peanut butter y'all and i like the crunchy cause it just gives you a little snap all right so see how easy that peanut butter came out of there jamie because i sprayed it so all you have to do son is dump your sugar in there and we're just gonna run this through the food processor [Music] all right so there we go all we're gonna do just let it let it smooth up this is going to be kind of

Ovn2ADGKwp0.json;hey y'all I'm Paula Deen and you know not all foods look as good as they taste and I happen to call those foods grub food and on today's show my sons Jamie and Bobby are gonna be helping me fix a grub fest we're gonna be starting with my barbecue meatloaf that's packed full of sweet and tangy flavor and then we're gonna move on to Wayne's beefy macaroni and cheese yeah beef and cheese just doesn't get much better than that and last but not least is my banana split cake it's so sugary and sweetened so y'all want to grab plenty of napkins and maybe even a bib cause it's time by a drug fest you gonna be all about grubbing and grub food and to me grub food is is just real honest food food that just tastes good that everybody across America likes and course to me there's no grub food like a meatloaf a barbecue meatloaf so I'm gonna start with a pound and a half of ground beef and a half a cup of tomato sauce and I'm gonna move this over here because that's gonna go in the sauce that we're gonna top our meatloaf with I'm gonna add a cup of breadcrumbs and these are fresh breadcrumbs I'm gonna add one diced onion and Gertie's sticking close to me this morning y'all she loves meatloaf so we're gonna add one egg and then salt and pepper and just do this to taste and we're just gonna mix those ingredients together Michael fusses at me because you know he worked hard to buy this ring and to see me getting food on in it just kills him but I just feel so much better about them being on my fingers I just rather have them dirty and on my fingers than clean and lost you know but a second I'm gonna have to take them off so I can really get in here alright so I'm just gonna take our meatloaf and put it into our baking dish and I want to make sure he's nice and compact in there so he won't have a bunch of cracks all right now we're gonna make our sauce and our sauce is gonna be a little bit on the sweet side to our tomato sauce I'm gonna start by adding the Worcestershire sauce the brown sugar the Dijon mustard the vinegar now we're just gonna pour this over our meatloaf YUM all right so we're gonna put this in a 350 degree preheated oven and we're gonna let it bake for an hour alright I've got that meatloaf in the oven and remember about every 15 minutes we're gonna go to that oven and spoon that sauce on top of that meatloaf and keep it basted for the entire hour that it's baking but in the meantime y'all I've got another one you know around my house I can't do anything in small amounts I have to have a lot of whatever I'm cooking because not only now do I have my two sons I've got another son and another daughter and I got a niece and I got a brother and I got their friends there's always somebody to feed in our house look at this I get it I get it it's one of my favorite --white Oh what are you doing Bobby you want one or two pieces Oh - I'm gonna have - two dozen white bread man yes Hector I'm gonna get us some bread please just a second Dave the boys just gonna try to baste em it's two of them thanks mom thanks my favorite appreciate that I don't think you basted it enough though where y'all going gonna watch TV thanks mom oh well Lisa left me the biggest part that barbecue sauce is just perfectly yummy you know this piece of meatloaf two pieces of white bread and some mayonnaise it just don't get no grub here and you know I think I'm gonna have to excuse me I can't stand and I've got to find me some bread oh man I can't wait this is the absolute perfect way to eat meatloaf and y'all see I'm not being stingy with that mayonnaise what a sandwich hey boys oh that looks good I think I have a sandwich now oh one for sure I guess you won't so guys I forgot to get the bananas for the banana split cake so guess who's doing the next segment what do you cook him off Wayne's beefy Mac y'all be fine you can do it so I guess it's uh I guess it is all right then so next on the Jamie and Bobby's home cooking show Wayne's beefy macaroni sounds good does sound good as we wait for Paula so stay tuned and we'll be right back to the Bobby and Jamie show [Music] [Music] welcome back y'all and do not adjust your televisions this is Paula's home cookin you believe we are out of bananas and moms had to go out and pick some up so we're taking over this segment we're gonna do Wayans beefy macaroni this comes from a friend of mom's up in Maryland his name is Wayne so first thing we're gonna do is start with a skillet we're gonna put a couple squirts of some vegetable oil down here I guess what we should do first is we got a pot of boiling water yeah one box of elbow macaroni I'm gonna put my fresh garlic down in this pan and now I see Jamie this is this is a variation of one of my favorite things that mom cook she used to make a homemade goulash for me but I see that some of the ingredients are different and I know that you're familiar with Wayne's recipe and I'm really not so tell me what you want me to do and how to help you well this is the main ingredient of a lot of our recipes and this is a sauteed fresh garlic onion and bell pepper and we're gonna cook this until it's soft if you want to stir this Bobby alright well I'm gonna put some salt down in our macaroni first we forgot to do that I mean I don't want compare it but similar to like that lasagna basically Bobby all it is is a goulash recipe that we're gonna put in a casserole dish don't cover it with cheese and bake it off that looks pretty good Bob okay so we're done here go ahead and pull this off now we're gonna leave your pan there I'm just gonna take this stuff out and then I'm gonna get you to brown the hamburger meat huh I'm just gonna Brown this like we were making a lasagna spaghetti pretty standard stuff anytime I'm doing any cooking with beef I always always Psalm that Brit can't get can't hurt it well when do we do that do we do that while it's in the bowl or do we drop it in there and begin to brown it and then season well this is warming back up let's do it this way just put a little bit of salt in here and that way once you get in the pan you can just concentrate on cooking it all right back up I'm your little brother what I can do this okay maybe Brown that hamburger meat off are those noodles born the noodles are boiling you go just brown that off might want to turn that down a little bit so you don't get grease splatter on you looks like the noodles are done I'm gonna drain those you want to go ahead and get everything seasoned yeah do you want to do this now or are we gonna combine everything after a branch a wide range that's almost brown we'll strain that grease off of there okay before we season it up it's a hot pot Jamie's got more experience than I do Jamie was working in restaurants well before I was the first restaurant I ever worked in actually belonged to my mom so my cooking skills are still a work in progress so to speak and I like to get in the kitchen with Jamie anytime I can cuz I can I can always learn from him how many years has it been now Jen that you've been cooking for mom in a week it'll be 16 years hard to believe the thing about it is that Bobby is that everybody that cooks I mean you'll always there's always more to learn but it's something that you just keep doing and you always some people come in and say gosh it it looks so simple and you make it look so simple but it's just the knowledge that you're armed with is what makes it look simple okay this is some oregano by we're gonna put some dried oregano in here and we've got some basil this is my favorite anyone else you got some cumin over here yeah cumin is what gives it the really distinct flavor right I'd love to put cumin in my chili okay Bobby let's put those canned crushed tomatoes in okay and three cups of cans recutting yes you shouldn't act like I've cooked a lot longer than you have you and I were there with mom when we started well no I mean I've been cooking with mom and with you and at home for you know better than better than 20 years now but as far as the experience is concerned I mean cooking in restaurants for selling food yeah you know I've been I've been using people as guinea pigs for over 20 years I couldn't have been selling that well still I'm still learned so we're gonna do now is we're just gonna add all this delicious stuff onto this macaroni and give it a big turn let's see I hope this bow is big enough oh this smells so good I just love meat and pasta and this is so close to my favorite the goulash that mom used to making it's so simple you know it's just like everything that mom does that's what I was saying it's all about what you're familiar with you know I bring that over here Jamie I'll hold your bowl if you want to scrape that off into your casserole dish there we lightly grease this so it wouldn't stick too bad so we're just gonna cover the top with cheese and at 350 everything's done on the inside so we just want to melt this cheese real good so it's about 2 cups because this is a pretty full casserole I've got your oven its own at 350 so if you want to drop that in there then that looks good and because Paula's home cooking is my favorite show on television and I know how she does it we have one already ready practically screams grub faster good great and that's something that looks wonderful should we test it I think so so yeah give coming it looks great yeah see how good all that comes together in there yeah and you see what I mean when I say that this Vermont reminds me of like a baked lasagna mm hmm hmm man is that good I don't go away coz when we come back mom will be back with the bananas for the banana split cake Jamie thank you for the lesson Wayne thank you this is spectacular [Music] [Music] okay guys I'm back with the bananas how'd it go how'd y'all do yeah we have fun that's a simple recipe Paula's home cooking is still no longer the next dish that we're gonna do it's just a banana split cake but I have to tell y'all this is one of those recipes that I've always had a lot of calls on because of the controversy of the raw egg in the dish and this dish doesn't get cooked and you know I'm just not afraid of raw eggs as long as they're nice and tight in their shell no cracks and they hadn't expired but for those of you out there that might have an issue with that you can use a pasteurized egg in place of it and then that way you have no worries at all Jamie why don't you start by making a crust to my favorite things graham cracker crumbs and butter it's about 4 cups of graham cracker crumbs and then just stick of butter and we're gonna do a little something different the recipe doesn't call to stick this crust in the oven but I like what heat does to this it makes it kind of hard and in form more like a a hard crust so we're just gonna press this into our dish and we're gonna stick it in the oven for like five to eight minutes and pull it out and let it cool so while you're doing that I'm gonna slice the bananas and Bobby you want to go ahead and make the filling side yeah I'm gonna start with two sticks of butter and I'm gonna go ahead and begin to cream that I'm gonna add two eggs beat two eggs into this as well and I'm gonna add in a box one one-pound box of powdered sugar all right James son if you want to go ahead and get that in the dish and get it in the oven we're gonna put that in a 350 degree oven I said for about five to eight minutes just gonna harden up and Bobby how are you coming over there son perfectly alright Jamie I've got another one in the oven if you would go ahead and get it out please cuz we want to make sure it's cool we don't want to put this together while it's hot you know Bobby it's funny you've never had any cooking experience like Jamie had you really had you in sales yeah well I got my experience trial trial by fire I really wanted you to join us and you did you quit your salesman's job and you came over and you became the dishwasher I've been working out for you taking me so far and then you were promoted yeah all the dessert the pastry shell and I got really good at it never got bored with it but I really got no not at all and I've always you know growing up with you or growing up in your house rather no I always enjoyed cooking but I didn't really get the joy of once I started cooking for people and getting their reaction from it that's what I really started to enjoy to me there's nothing like our job granted it's hard hard work you really put yourself on the line out there you really opened yourself up for shots but if you're good at what you do there's nothing like that immediate gratification that we get from walking out on the floor and people saying oh my goodness you know I just love your food see one looks on their face that looks so good and buttery Jamie you know it's not the easiest thing in the world to spread mm-hmm alright so what we're gonna do now son I'm just gonna spread this bananas all over and then we're gonna top our bananas with the canned crushed pineapple that's been very very well drained all right I'm gonna top this now you can use a frozen whipped topping but y'all know when I'm making these kind of desserts that I only use one thing in that sweet and fresh cream all right so that was just that simple and now we're just gonna top it with a few graham cracker crumbs that an ad from Jamie's crust and that looks yummy mm-hmm and you got dishes yes oh this looks so good gonna fix the dish mom well I think I'm just gonna try is it good - really good I think I'm gonna try just a bite I love the pineapple in it I do tuna pineapple really makes it to you my darling and to the part you played into all the desserts that we serve at the lady and sons I think I'm the reason for your success here for you Bobby mister me that's really good mmm you know I think I'm gonna have to take a break and when we come back I'm gonna share with you a great grubbing tip many BLTs you're not gonna believe how simple easy and delicious they are so I'm gonna find a wash rag for the boys and I'll see you back here in just a second [Music] you [Music] has your husband ever brought home unexpected company with them what are you gonna feed them you need a quick little appetizer something that will fill them up well I've got just the trick for you because there's a good chance that you have all these items in your refrigerator all you're gonna need is lettuce bacon tomatoes mayonnaise and sour cream and of course some kind of chip and most all of us keep these things in our house at all times all you want to do is shred your lettuce mix your sour cream and your mayonnaise together two of my favorite condiments love sour cream we're gonna just mix those two items together quickly put those in the center of our container just pile our lettuce up around it top it with Tomatoes top it with bacon stick our chips

only is it fun to eat and make these it's fun to dress them up so that's what we're gonna be doing today y'all come along with me because it's candy time [Music] you know we're very lucky here in Savannah because we're the home of SCAD Savannah College of Art and Design so we have some great art supply stores well right now I'm in primary art supply and they have some neat things look this

candies I just love it so I'm gonna share the almond coconut balls with you first now I've got two boxes of confectioner's sugar and I'm gonna add one stick of a really softened butter I'm gonna add one can of sweetened condensed milk now I'm gonna put a teaspoon of almond flavoring a bag of sweetened flaked coconut and I'm gonna finish this off with a cup and a half of chopped almonds your hands kids kind of look like the abominable snowman when you pull them out all right and see how quickly we've gotten that together it doesn't take long at all okay got to do a quick wash-up I've got me a cookie sheet ready here and y'all will notice that these are no cooked candies now this is the boring part making balls so you might want to whistle in for the family cause before you know it you get to talking and chatting and laughing and having a good time and all the balls are done I'm bored already I cuz I got some ready in the refrigerator so they ain't no sense in me doing this is it alright here's our chilled Bowl now I'm gonna take chocolate chips now you can use semi sweet or unsweet alright I'm gonna use a half a bar of paraffin wax and that's why it's that you used to like make your jellies and jams with and this is gonna make the chocolate stick to our candy so I'm just gonna melt that over some ball and water it's gonna make our balls real real shiny and pretty way to go Paula alright now we're gonna take our candy we're gonna stick a skewer into it you can use it toothpick but I found that the skewers are heavier and it just works better so we're just gonna run them around in there using another stick I'm gonna push that off and just cover that hole pretty neat little trick getting it so we're gonna do that same thing again perfect alright I tell y'all something this has made me so hungry I've got some in the refrigerator that's already set cause you can leave these out on the counter or you can put them in the refrigerator well I want to rush it along so I put mine in the refrigerator so why don't we stop and have a little bite of candy and then I'll come back and do these while we're on break good least look and they've hardened up now these candies are good at any holiday look at those chocolates you don't stick around cuz when we come back I'm gonna be making old-timey fudge like I used to make years ago and pecan praline more alright I'm gathering up the last of the things that I'm gonna need to make two of my candies that I love so very much but let's get started with our old-timey fudge right now and I'm gonna put three cups of sugar and a cup of evaporated milk I'm gonna put that on this side and then over here I'm gonna put our cocoa and we're just gonna incorporate that real good until our sugar has dissolved and our cocoa is well blended in there all right now I'm gonna stir in about three tablespoons of a white corn syrup and this is gonna make our candy just come all together like I said you just want to make sure you have a good thermometer that you can read some of them today they're hard to read all right so I'm gonna go ahead and clip this onto our pot yeah we're just 150 degrees right now so we're gonna just let that cook over kind of kind of medium heat so we'll want to keep a close eye on our thermometer all right now over here we're gonna move on try a pecan praline morsels I've got my two cups of pecans here and I've got a half a cup of light brown sugar and a half a cup of heavy cream the brown sugar and the heavy cream are gonna give it kind of a praline coating on these pecans and they're just gonna be so good now we're gonna put these on our pan we're gonna put them in a 350 preheated oven and we're gonna let them bake for about 20 minutes after about 10 minutes I'm gonna go the oven and stir them because you have to be very very careful with nuts because if they burn which they won't burn easily there's just nothing you can do to get that burnt taste out of them all right so we're gonna give our pan a squirt all right we're gonna dump these onto our cookie sheet all right so let's get these in the oven because I've got to give my attention back to that fudge all right ten minutes we'll give those a quick little turn to just make sure they're not burning it's right there y'all around to 34 to 35 with this thermometer is reading properly all right I'm gonna take that out and I'm gonna add six tablespoons of butter may have been seven tablespoons I added I can't tell all right we're gonna add about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla flavoring and cup of chopped nuts we're about a cup and a half I like to add the pecan to it but you can do walnuts macadamia nuts alright we've got our dish nice and buttered now we're just gonna stir this I think to save some wear and tear on my arm I think I'm gonna do this with electric mixer just a little hand mixer we're gonna beat it until it's not quite so shiny [Applause] we want to work quickly from this point and it looks very good y'all just get this into our butter dish before it gets too hard let it cool for a few minutes and then I'm gonna score it and cut it but I think we have created a wonderful pan of old-timey fudge I gotta run over here and check on these pecans because I know it's been ten minutes and we need to turn them and toss them around we've got yeah those look pretty good just gonna give them a quick toss all right now we're gonna stick those in for about ten more minutes now when we come back I'm gonna be making buttery nut fingers so y'all don't go anywhere cuz we got some more good sweet things coming up see you in a couple [Music] I don't want to get my spoon out because I know I'm gonna need it in a minute but in the meantime we've got to check on our pecans all right those look delicious don't they all right let's get them up and get them in our bowl cuz we don't want to keep these on that hot cookie sheet because they will continue to cook yeah I don't I don't know what happened all my little spatula respect this one's working out good in fact I'm really starting to get attached to it all right now I'm gonna move this because we're fixing to move on to an old standard of cookie now this particular recipe that I used was my grandmother Paul's and grandma made hers in balls well and sometimes I do them that way too but over the years I just started making them in fingers but in the meantime I've got two and a half cups of plain flour or all-purpose flour 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and we're just gonna mix those two ingredients together this cookie is very very easy but it does take a while because they have to bake for about 20 or 25 minutes which is what about 15 minutes longer than a normal cookie whoops Pillsbury Dough girl all right now I'm gonna start this off by using a wooden spoon to just kind of cut that butter in there a little all right now I'm gonna put in some vanilla flavoring and if you wanted to kind of shake your flavoring up you could do just about any kind of flavoring you want to orange flavor and would be nice almond would be delicious in there all right now I'm gonna add our chopped pecans and you can see how quickly let me get my hands in here it's coming together I still think that some of my best utensils are the ones that God gave me these two hands right here they make great spoons and mixers so like I said my grandmother Paul used to roll these into balls but I'm gonna roll mine into fingers and I just remembered our oven is on 350 from our pecans so I'm gonna reach over here and turn that to 325 and if my hands are not too greasy I'm just gonna fan it to cool it down for a minute because we're ready to put these in the oven all right so here we go into the oven [Applause] okay so we got those in the oven but I've gotten dough all over my hands so I'm gonna give a quick grant I love raw cookie dough but I don't want to mix it in with my fudge so I do want to get rid of that all right nothing this is probably my favorite time right now I get to cut into my fudge and let's see how it does oh and look ya'll look down here at my side she's enjoying this unusually cool but wonderful day we're having it's made all the dogs sleepy including this dog I could take a nap tube look at this wonderful fudge oh my goodness this brings back so many memories oh it could not be any more perfect it is just hard to beat the old-timey cooked fudge mmm just can't hardly wait not that this fudge needs that not at all but I just want to garnish the plate a little bit so I'm just gonna dust it with a little cocoa and just to make sure I do have enough nuts on it I'm just gonna sprinkle it with a few extra cuz I can always take my piece of fudge and dunk in there like that and get me a few more nuts mmm this is so good it's kind of got me booyah I'm lost in it but if I don't work my way out of this we gonna have bud burn if I can say it we're gonna have burned buttery fingers so let's go over here and check you can see how they swelled up a little those are perfect just barely a light brown let's see if I can alright now we're just gonna toss these in our powdered sugar while they are warm and look it's sticking so nicely I've got me a plate and when we come back I'm gonna show you some tips on how to wrap all these wonderful little goodies up [Music] I want to share a few tips with y'all on packaging your candy now that we've got it all made you can take tissue papers and it's very very pretty to take two different kinds of tissue paper and offset one of them pile your candy in the center as much as you want to give and then pull up the corners like so and tie them up with a pretty ribbon and you've got a perfect container and you can also buy a little colored sacks you can get your corresponding colors and write a message on them just like this and our pecans will go nicely in these sides because it kind of looks like a little peanut sac anyway and we'll just tie those up with a pretty ribbon you can use Halloween colors and look how cute that is a great little handout for the children at Halloween so if you don't have time to make your candy don't spread over it don't feel guilty don't feel bad you can go to the grocery store or the candy store and find all kind of beautiful candy and all different colors and you can package them in a clear bag and put the ribbon that matches the occasion on them it's gonna make your candy giving so easy boys and girls moms and dads grandmas and grandpas aunts and uncles whatever you're making of these dishes the butternut fingers the chocolate almond coconut balls the pecan praline morsels or old-timey old-fashioned fudge whether you want to pass these out at Holiday time or you just want to have them around your house for your family and friends when they drop in you're gonna find that they're all easy delicious recipes so until next time America I want to send Joe that's dishes from my sweet tooth to yours;['postres']

poCVs8ORMFc.json;- Hey y'all, you know just. lately I've been asking y'all, if you had a recipe that you and your family have loved for years, or just loved in the last year, to share 'em with me. And I'm so happy to be able. to give y'all credit for 'em. I'd just love to know what other families, love out there. So I'm getting some response and I'm going to read this. letter as quick as I can to you. Hey Paula, I love watching your videos. I usually watch them while. I'm making breakfast. Thanks for making me laugh,. it is so needed this year. I met you in Durham, North. Carolina about 15 years ago, I had my mom and baby girl with me. You held baby Madeline, and now she's learning to drive, I can't believe it. Anyway, I want to share a recipe for my grandmother Evelyn Brown, my mother's mother. She passed away several years ago but one way that we. like to remember her by is the good food she made for us, and the way she prepared. a meal for her family. This recipe is for Chew Bread. I don't know why she named it that. It's more like a cookie bar, and it's so good! I have kept the recipe, I have kept the recipe on a. Post-it note all this time, because I wrote it down. when I was talking to her on the phone, Lauren Caldwell. I thank you so much, Lauren, for sharing this recipe with me and, and all of our friends out there. It just, it just makes. me feel good to know that other people have wonderful memories like I have of being in the kitchen with mamas and grandmamas. and aunts and friends. So we are fixing to make. your grandmamas, Chew Bread. And again, I thank you Lauren. So here we go and plus it's real easy. You forgot to say that didn't you Lauren? Lauren? Lauren. It's Lauren, not Lauran. Alright, so preheat oven to. 300 degrees, we've done that. Butter a 13 by 9 by 2. pan, we've done that, combine one stick of melted butter, one box of light brown sugar, and two cups of self-rising flour. Now this sounds a little like. my Aunt Glennis's chewies. Do you Eddie. - [Eddie] Yes. - I just made some kind of recent- - [Eddie] Right, I think we. put coconut I think in ours. - [Woman] It had icing in too. - No, not on the Chewy's, not on the chewy. - [Eddie] The brownies had the icing - Oh yeah. The decorate Maggies Yes, yes, If everything wasn't. enough, there was an icing. All right. So that's, this bag is. equivalent to one box. It's a 16 ounce box. I love stirring recipes. You don't have to collapse. a big old mixer or anything. Okay, three eggs, three eggs beaten, and then pour those in. So it looks like this might be- all right now, that was. plain flour to what- - [Woman] Self rising - No. Two cups of self-rising. Okay, so it is going to rise up. And Lauren said bake for about 40 minutes it's tempting to cut into them, when they come out of the oven, but wait, they get sort of crackly tops, once they are cool, then you can cut them to squares and enjoy. Keep making those videos Paula. Thank you, Lauren. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right. It calls for an eight ounce. bag of semi-sweet chocolate, but there's no such thing as. an eight ounce bag anymore, they're nine ounce. So I'm going to leave. a little bit in there. Calls for three fourths of. a cup of chopped pecans. Yeah, this looks like my chewies. Chew bread, I love it. All right, now I'm going to stir in our. two cups of self-rising flour and let's see how much. vanilla, one teaspoon. That's kinda my teaspoon Lauren. I have a big teaspoon. Oh my gosh, I can't wait for. these to come out of the oven. So, you know, I, like I said, just lately, I have been requesting if. y'all would share your family recipes with me. And so Laura is, and I shot a video, of a pineapple cake the other day that somebody sent to me, it is out of this world and it's like this, you just mix it up - [Eddie] And it is gone. - It's gone. - [Eddie] That thing went fast - It was gone last night. - [Eddie] Yes. - It was one little edge like. that left and I ate that. Oh my gosh. And I'm going to be making another one. I'm going to make another one. because that was too good. - Okie dokie. - [Eddie] And I had it for breakfast. - You did. - [Eddie] I did. - That's where my cake went. Oh, I'm going to make one this afternoon. If I've got a can of pineapple. Calls like 20 ounce can of pineapple. Now who sent that to me? - [Woman] Well, you might. not need to after this. Elizabeth. - Elizabeth, yes Elizabeth Vanwinkle I Love it. All right. I think I hear Michael coming in. Chew bread, it really does look like. my aunt Glennis's chewies. So we'll see. Grandmothers have left us with lotta good memories over the years. You know, I just hope that when my grandchildren get some age on, that they'll, they'll say, oh, remember granny? What she used to make for us? Cause' that's what it's all about is, keeping the family going. With all your family traditions. So in the oven this goes, 40 minutes Lauren says, and that's what I'm going to put it on. That looks matching mighty good. It doesn't look like bread either does it? Okay, we got Lauren's. grandmother's Chew bread. We cook it for 40 minutes and she said, now you gon' wanna cut into it, but don't. Because it's so much better after it's cooled. - [Eddie] I love the top - [Woman] And it crinkles on the top - It's going to crinkle as it cools. So I'm going to do as Lauren requested, I'm going to let it cool before I cut it, but I'll be sharing it with y'all. When I do. Hey Lauren, I have done. exactly as you told me to do and we have let these get cold, grandmamas chew bread. It reminds me very much of my. aunt Glennis's chewy cakes. Okay, I can't wait Lauren. - [Woman] Brown sugar All I can say is keep them. cards and letters coming kids. Thank you for sharing Lauren.;['postres']

For ourselves, and for our children. And uh, Claudia, wants. to share with you today A cookie recipe that she loves to do. So, with no further ado, take it away My beautiful bride, Claudia Dean. - Simple, I think is the key,. like, I like to do things That don't take much time. Bobby loves to go like,. through the recipes And measure everything. I measured these just for the purposes So you can make it at home. But if it were for me, I. would just eyeball everything. So, I brought this specially for Bobby Because he hates when my hair is down. - Yeah, run your fingers. through it a few times. - I'll wash my hands - Oh yeah - Bobby hates hair. - Hey, I'm a kitchen guy. - Hates hair. - I'm a restaurant guy - If he sees hair - No, I don't mind hair my head - Its like, his biggest nightmare. - Ironic that I hate hair and. look at how it paid me back I don't have, hardly any of it. Where I don't like hair is on. the countertops, in the food - Even in like the bathroom. floor, he'll freak. - All right, so, back to the recipe. And it is? What kind of cookies are these? - Hates hair, so I'm going to put my I'm going to put my nail away, my ring. - Put your nails away. - Oh Coco Um, Coco's our dog, one of them. Okay, so we are going to do. a five minute cookie recipe. - Okay - We can call it - I'm looking at the clock - Five minute no, sorry, five ingredients. - Okay I was going to say - Its going to take twenty minutes From the beginning til the end. - That right? - And its because it. cooks for fifteen minutes. So to put it together. is only five minutes. Um Its a chocolate Almond butter cookie. No A chocolate, almond cookie. Or an almond, chocolate chip cookie. - Mhm - Which one sounds better? - I liked the chocolate,. almond butter cookie. - Its not almond butter, just almond. - Okay, well chocolate,. almond cookie then. - Okay chocolate, almond cookie. - By the way, speaking. of things being great. I look great. Am I a lucky duck? Or. what? Cause, everything That's going on right here Are you going to wear earrings. today? Oh, you got some on. I didn't notice them. - Do you have your target shirt on? - I certainly do, damn right I do. - I got it for him. - You bought this. - Target - Don't make fun of it. - This means we're not going to - What were you doing at target? - With my face mask. Okay, so Okay, so We have We're just going to mix it all in. - Take it away. - We preheated our oven at three fifty. - Damn right. Then what? - And again, the recipe. that y'all can find online I'm doubling it, because its Friday. Even though you might not. be seeing this on a Friday. And I want cookies for the weekend. So, I'm doing double the recipe. - And there's a lot of. mouths in this house. - Yes - So they will get eaten, believe me. - Yes, so, we are going to have - What kind of utensils do you need? - Hands, so, this is very simple. - I don't like it - No, no, you use your. hands, hands, your hands. All right, so, we have - Your hands? - Yes We have, you may get some. nail polish, if its my hands. - Why was I looking at the. whole nail, oh , it is my nails. - Ew - all right, so, we have - The visual We have Two cups Almond What's it called? Flour, thank you Eddie, I know flour. You can do this with any, like ground oat - Mhm - So it would be like oat. flour, but this is almond flour. - That's a good start - Mhm, well we may want a spoon. - How about a rubber spatula? - All right, then we have one cup of almond butter. Am I as good as your mom? - No, its just, you asked me what I like - I'm just trying to remember the amount. I said, chocolate almond. butter is what I like And you said its not almond butter. - Well, there's almond. flour, so you can't just Call it almond butter,. its like double almond. I'm sure I remember the amounts. I poured this in this container Like five minutes ago and I. already forgot the amounts. - Two cups of flour, One cup of almond butter.. - I just eyeball everything. I just like to eyeball. - Its good, I like that. - Then, half a cup of maple syrup. Lets talk about each ingredient Lets go back, the almond. flour is just ground almond So you can do, this is. very natural, very simple Ground almonds, then you have the almond butter And its just ground almonds. So when you go to the store. you want to get the almond Butter that the only. ingredients are almonds And maybe sea salt. But no sugar or oil, you. don't need any of that. Like the almond butter. already has a lot of fat. Which are healthy fats,. any free fats, that's okay. And then the maple syrup,. we just get like, its not Like the pancake, its. like real maple syrup. Like Vermont maple syrup. Even though it came from Publics - That's a running joke, a. running joke in our family. A running joke about a. trip we took to Vermont That we took a few years back. - Yeah - Now as far as the almond butter And peanut butter is concerned. - Baby I said with your hands. I do it with my hands. But Bobby doesn't want. our nail polish in it so - There are almond butters. and peanut butters out There that are completely natural. That the sole ingredients. would be almonds. - Roasted almonds or peanuts - Right - And sometimes it has sea salt - Right - But you don't want it to. have sugar or like palm oil Or any of that, that's. just not sustainable its added fat and sugar. that you don't need. - And you know what, I'm here. to tell you that they're good. The natural ones, they really are good. - Bobby for lunch every day has Two bananas with almond butter. - Yeah usually I do,. cause its quick and easy. That's on the go food. These, okay, so, - So, this is what that looks like. - Yes and Bobby did it with a spatula. That's pretty good. And then we have half a. cup of chocolate chips. So, I'm using dark. chocolate chips for baking. You can just like mash a. chocolate bar, whatever works. But this is a Vegan Chocolate chips So these can be vegan cookies. - Mm - Or you can just use milk. chocolate, whatever you like. There you go - Probably a Semi sweet Probably a real high cacao. - Yeah that's like fifty five I think. And then there is a half Sorry I'm just trying. to remember the amounts. - Its all right, its all. right, its countable. Its a full teaspoon. - Okay - Of baking powder - Okay - Perfect, that's it. My memory, deceased my brain. - Well, I think that you're. doing good considering you have Three young babies Two dogs Me - A husband And usually, like again. like, the way I cook I just eyeball everything. So when I have to put. everything into amounts That's hard for me - I'm with you Claud, I always, yeah - You always like to. measure everything, baby. - No, well I do, I'm about. to make a comment on it I think that pinch and. dash cooking is lots of fun And I don't think that it. has to be exact or precise But when baking you do have to. be a little bit more precise. - Well, this is like kind of baking So what we're going to do This is probably going. to be sixteen cookies. Again the recipe that. y'all can find online Is eight cookies. So we are going to make little balls. - Do you want a spoon? - No, we are going to do. it with our hands, come on. I took my wedding ring out, so Oh, should I bring it here? - Mhm - So we're going to make Actually, I think with the spatula It got mixed better than with the hands. What would I do without Bobby? - You'd probably be better off. But my mom has always said, The best tools in The kitchen are the. ones that god gave you. So you're not wrong. - Yeah but last time made But last time I made them I. think they were not as pretty. You know what? We are going. to need another of this. So you are just going to make Little balls with your hands. And you're going Not little balls, you're just. going to make your cookies. And they are going to be so good. And the fun thing about this recipe Is that you can make it. whatever you want to make Whatever you want it to be. So you can do almond butter. These, again are almond chocolate cookies. As Bobby called them. But you can make them like,. peanut butter, if you wanted. Or if you like sun flower butter. Or whatever butter you. like, you can just use that. And again if you want. something that is not almond Or maybe you have an almond. allergy, or who knows what. You can use ground oats as your flower.

pTqWCb9Dy0A.json;"(laughs) - Guess what time it is, kiddies? It's time for Halloween. And Aunt Paula is here. to show y'all some tricks and some treats. No tricks, no tricks. Just treats, isn't that. right, isn't that right, Sam Skeleton?. (laughs) I'm gonna put him back. where Eddie had him, just cooking right there in the fireplace. I think we've cooked all. the meat off his bones, don't you, Eddie? - Picked it all off.. - And we have cooked it all off. Oh, and the fire feels so good and the witch has got her witches brew brewing in the cast iron skillet. And it's just looking spooky around here. So I'm gonna slide on over here and I'm gonna watch out for goblins, 'cause I've been a good girl, a big girl and I don't want the goblins to get me. I just want treats today, not tricks. So the first thing we gonna. start making today, kids, is pumpkin spice cookies. And they are so easy to. make and yet so good. And these are gonna have a frosting on it. And there's nothing better. than a cookie with frosting. It's like two in one treats. So we are gonna start. by beating the butter. And I've got two sticks of butter here. And after we get our dough made, it's gonna have to sit in the refrigerator for about an hour because. we are gonna roll this out and we are gonna use our cookie cutters. Let's see, there they are over there. We're gonna use our cookie cutters to make our cookies in. the shape of pumpkins. All right, so we're gonna mix our sugar and our butter together. until it's completely, uh oh. You know what? My mama told me that. it always works better if you plug this in. (laughs) Thank you, mama. Thank you mama. Okay, so this should take. maybe a couple of minutes. So we got that nice and creamy. So the next thing we're. gonna do is add our eggs one at the time. And we've got two eggs. Come on now egg. There you go.. (laughs) So while we're making these cookies, I would like for y'all to think about your favorite Halloween memory, your all time favorite one, whether you're a wee little. child or a great big grown up. Tell me, and if you. would send me the story of your favorite Halloween memory. Can y'all do that? Okay, egg number two. And we're just gonna beat. this until it's creamy. And then we're going to. give it one more twirl with our spatula to get. that all down from the sides so that it's well incorporated. And now we're gonna add a rum flavoring. And let's see, how much is that? A half a teaspoon of rum. and a tablespoon of vanilla. So there's our vanilla. And let's see, somehow all my little. teaspoons have gotten away so I'm gonna use my. tablespoon to judge that. Oh, there was my teaspoon.. - I was like there they are. (laughs) - It's so good when you can see. And one tablespoon of vanilla extract. And this is that good extract. And you can find these in our stores in our Paula Deen Family. Kitchen restaurants. And I think the Lady and. Sons, don't we carry this at the Lady and Sons, Eddie?. - Oh yeah, definitely. - It's the good stuff. All right, so we're just. gonna incorporate that. Make sure, oh, that rum smells so good. It's not that kind of rum. that'll make you silly. You know, (laughs) this rum won't affect your thinking. All right, so I'm gonna come. over here and let's see. I think that's a, yep,. that's my powdered sugar. All this is for our icing. All right, so I'm gonna add a little salt. Two teaspoons of baking powder. And I think it's like one. tablespoon, one tablespoon plus. Anyway, let's see how much is. supposed to go in the icing, 'cause I wanna make sure this is right. Whisk together cream. cheese, half cup butter and one tablespoon of pumpkin spice. So the most pumpkin spice. does go in our icing, not our cookie. So we're gonna mix this together and we're gonna slowly add this to our egg and butter mixture. And that's when we're gonna. put it in the refrigerator and let it get hard, or at. least firm so we can roll it out without it coming apart when. we go to do the cookie cutouts. Okay. There we go. Like a half a cup at the time. And we'll need to keep our spatula handy so we can make sure all of our ingredients gets mixed in well. And after every couple of additions, we're gonna take our. spatula and we're gonna rub all those ingredients down and make sure they all get mixed up. Okay, so I'm gonna get some wax paper or parchment paper to. wrap our dough up in. And we'll start the hour with the refrigeration part. Now let's see, what do we want to use? Let's use wax paper. I love wax paper, I. couldn't do without it. That and parchment paper. Plop. (laughs) Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. See that dough is still real soft. What you doing, Theresa? - I'm cleaning your mess.. - Okay, thank you. Everybody should be so lucky to have a Theresa and Eddie to help. me keep my mess clean. - I take it you didn't. like all the pumpkin spice? - No, that goes in. A tablespoon goes into icing.. - Oh, awesome. I'm glad you read the directions. (laughs) - Let's see.. (laughs) - [Theresa] Why don't you. add it to the icing too. - It's pretty good. The cookie is not all that sweet. - [Theresa] I like that. - But what's gonna make it sweet is this. There's three cups of powdered sugar and an eight ounce package of cream cheese and a stick of butter. So make sure this is out. all at room temperature so you can beat it nice. and easy, look at that. That feels like two. pounds of cookie dough. All right, while our dough is. chilling in the refrigerator for our pumpkin frosted cookies, I'm gonna go ahead and make the icing but I tell y'all what I. think I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to move to a smaller frame. That frame is so big with my hat on. All right, so you wanna make. sure that your cream cheese and your butter is at room temperature. And you can see how nice and soft this is. So Eddie, this little tool. right here is wonderful. And Michael and I have been using it for our mayonnaise on a sandwich. And it worked so beautiful. And I was just asking Eddie, I said, where did this come from? It just appeared in my kitchen one day. And Eddie remembered. about this precious woman, Joelle Mertzel, she is. the inventor of Butterie. ""Please join me in my. mission to spread the word ""that butter does not. require refrigeration"". I've said it so many times, Joelle, so thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm gonna read this. book to my grandchildren 'cause every 11 of them love butter. They wouldn't be mine if. they didn't love butter. But look at this cute. little card, a gift for you. So it said, hey, Eddie and Paula here's another fun box. of goodies for butter. What do you think? If you ever need a comrade in. arms to talk butter, call me. I'm your gal and probably the only person who's written a book about butter storage. - [Eddie] And that's the picture of it. - Hugs and kisses. Yes, that's the picture.. - Well on the front. - Oh yeah, there it is, big time. And it comes with a knife,. you know, to store it. Cute little container. So thank you so, so much, Joelle. I love this thing right here. So I'm glad because I didn't realize that that came from her,. it was a gift from her. So I love hearing from. y'all and hearing your ideas and just everything that y'all are doing. All right, so we gonna move. on up for our frosting, for our Halloween cookies. And I'm gonna beat up our. cream cheese and butter. And now I'm fixing to add one tablespoon of the pumpkin pie spice. Yeah that's almost a tablespoon. I think it's close enough. So this is just gonna. take a couple of minutes. Now I'm gonna add our powdered sugar, you know kind of in small amounts, so I won't cover myself with it. This is gonna be so good. And I love a cookie, a frosted cookie. There's nothing any better. It's like half cake, half cookie. Perfect. Perfect dough. - [Theresa] Now we'll. just need the cookies, so you can cook 'em,. - Yes. - [Theresa] we can ice them. - Now we gotta make the cookies. All right now I'm not gonna attempt to roll out all that. dough at one time, y'all. And you know, for years. I've got a tablecloth, and I swear I think it was my mother's, maybe it's mine from before. the war, I don't know. But I've always liked to. roll my dough out on that. But having this soap stone,. you know, it's kind of like what is that stuff that. you use for peanut brittle? What kind of slab is that? - It's like marble.. - Marble, yes, marble. You know, this kind of reminds me of that. Now we're gonna roll this dough out to a quarter of an inch thick. - [Theresa] Will that dough freeze well? - Yes, yes, yes.. - (indistinct). - Yes, yes. Which is perfect. You could make all this up ahead of time and you wouldn't have. to waste all your time. Now y'all tell me when it looks like a fourth of an inch thick, 'cause you know, I lost. my distance in this eye. - [Eddie] It's pretty thick on this side. - Yeah, it's still thick.. - Okay, on this side? - This side.. - This side? This side?. - Yes, all of it is what we're. - [Paula] All right, how about this side? - [Theresa] Keep coming,. no come closer to Eddie. - Closer to Eddie.. - Yeah. Like all of this right there. Think that's pretty good, Eddie? - All right, let's go this a-way. - [Theresa] If you got too much, it's gonna start falling apart. - Yeah, it's gonna start spreading. All right. Thank y'all, thank you very. much, thank you very much. (laughs) Okay I got this thin over here, y'all. I got that real thin. All right, so now when you go. to cutting out your cookies, you wanna make sure that you are as wise with your dough as you can be. That's not bad, is it, y'all?. - No, it's good. - That's the thick end.. (laughs) Now what I don't use, I'll roll back up. Put it in the refrigerator,. let it harden up again. See, you just don't wanna. waste any more of your dough than you can possibly help. All right we're gonna bake these. about 10 minutes, probably, I think.. - Yeah, 350 for eight to 10 minutes. - Okay and I'm gonna put our. dough back in the refrigerator, 'cause that's very, very,. very, very, very important that that stays chilled. Almost to the fun part. And you know what part I'm. talking about, don't you? The eating part. Now we frosting them with our. spice, our pumpkin pie spice. Ooh and they look delicious. And let's get a little. frosting on that stem. And now, let's see. Yeah. Now we, oh no.. (laughs) Now we're gonna sprinkle him orange and we're gonna sprinkle his stem, oops, black with licorice. How's that kiddies? I like it, I like it a lot. - Olivia would love it.. - Olivia would adore this. Let me see your pictures.. (laughs) Oh, you know what we could do? We could even give our pumpkins eyes. Uh oh, he looks kind of. cross eyed, doesn't he? (laughs) Get that eye back over there, pumpkin, now that looks better. Look, Theresa. It's so cute. - [Theresa] Aw, that's adorable. - Isn't that adorable?. (laughs) Happy Halloween! We just need to figure out how to give him a pretty little mouth. - [Theresa] I'm not. ever trying that again. - We need some licorice, some red licorice.. - Oh, that is what we need. - Let me see, y'alls. Happy Halloween!";['postres']
pTWppunXJ0c.json;"- Hey y'all, we're still as busy as a cat covering up his stuff. So Miss Theresa selected the. recipe for this video today, and it sounds really good. And the person that. sent it sounds so cute. Doesn't she Theresa? - [Theresa] She does. She had. me at cherry and chocolate. - Uh huh. She was so in love with cherry. She said, well, this is what she says, One day, years ago, I couldn't decide if I wanted to bake a chocolate pie or a cherry pie. Because I loved them both. Well, I decided to combine. them and this is what I did. And it is now our family favorite. - [Theresa] It's about to. be my family favorite too. (laughing) - And this comes from Dawn Wilkson, Pleasant View, Tennessee. Thank you, Dawn. Thank you so much. And can I say what her name is on the, - [Theresa] I love that,. you have to say it. - Her, what do you call it? - [Theresa] Well don't say. the thing, just tell her what is says from. Who's it. say it's from? Sassy something? No, up at the top. - Sassy Banjo. - [Theresa] Yeah, don't say. anything else after that, but just say sassy. - Sassy Banjo is her name. - [Theresa] Yeah, that's. what she uses as her, - I love it! - [Theresa] That's her email. - I wish you were here Dawn. Theresa is nuts for both. cherries and chocolate. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm - So you had made her a happy, happy girl. - [Theresa] You like. cherry and chocolates too. - Oh, heck yeah. Chocolate covered cherry, honey! Get me that little box. - [Theresa] And add pie crust to it? - Yeah! - [Theresa] What more could you want? - Yeah! Alright. So this is very, very. simple, what Dawn does. So you have two unbaked pie crust. And Dawn says I make my own, but my sons use the. Pillsbury refrigerated crust. Listen, I'm with your sons, Dawn. Let's not stress if we don't have to. Alright, we've got two 10 ounce. cans of cherry pie filling. That we're going to put in our bowl. These lids are so dangerous, y'all. - [Theresa] Sorry, I meant to, - [Paula] You have to be careful. - [Theresa] I meant to pop it, but I wanted it covered until you got it. - [Paula] So careful, because it's like, it's just like a razor blade. There we go! Mmm, Mmm,Mmm! I'm happy already! Happy, happy. (giggling) Okay. So we are going to put this in our bowl. You know what? This weekend y'all I made, we had a delayed birthday. dinner for my baby, Jack. - [Theresa] Who's not a baby. (laughing) - He'll always be my baby. (laughing) Ya know? He just turned 15, last month, and it was so many things going on. We, I didn't get to make. him his birthday meal. So he asked if I would. make it this past Saturday. So I did, and I'm telling you what, I couldn't have gotten that. meal together without Jack. He wound up making the biscuits, making the squash casserole. What else did he make? He cut up all the squash, he just did so much. And it was wonderful being in there with my oldest grandson who's so smart. So helpful. So kind. So courteous. So everything that I'd. want to be when I grow up. (laughing) - [Theresa] Exactly. - So, - [Theresa] that's a good resume. - Yes. So anyway, what I was getting to, is I made fresh apple fried pies for him. Apples are his favorite, and it was some kind of good. You didn't eat one did you, Eddie? - [Eddie] No, I didn't, actually, no. It seemed like they were. going out pretty quick. I know people kept looking for 'em. (laughing) - Everything went so quick. In the middle of the meal, I had to stop and cook another pot of rice. And I needed to make. another batch of biscuits, but I didn't do it. So everybody just had no. choice but quit eating. And you know, Eddie, I could. so tell that it's been a long, long time since, - [Eddie] It's been a full year. - They mama, mama's cooking. Yeah, it's been a full year. (cellophane crinkling) Oh, our scissors need replacing so bad. So, Dawn tells us to put your pie crust on the bottom, of your plate. And I have to tell you Dawn, to me, well, I, I can, I can stand a frozen pie shell in the tin. You know to me they're. not all that bad, but, this, to me, is much, much better than, than the one. Alright, I got to get. this centered just right. Okay. So now you can kind of do your, your edges any way you want to. You can kind of do them like that, or you can get a fork and. you can just fork 'em. Whatever you want to do. Whatever makes you happy. Kind of lay that back like that. - [Theresa] Do you, is. there a way to do it, Paula? Because, since you're going. to be putting a top on it too. - [Paula] Uh huh - [Theresa] Oh, is there a difference in how you fold 'em or no? - [Paula] I don't know. Theresa,. you know, it has been very, very long since I've made a two crust pie. I mean, it's been years. - [Theresa] I like that even. more that it's two crusts. - [Paula] Uh Huh (laughing) Yes. Oh, I messed, I messed up on that when you got me tickled. and jerked him around. Okay. So there we go. Now she said, put the fruit. filling and the chocolate chips in a bowl and stir. We've done that. Pour into pie crust and. top with second crust. Top with milk and sprinkle. it with some sugar, because we'll want it shiny. This is gonna be insanely delicious. - [Theresa] I know. - You know that. - [Theresa] Yes! - So anyway, I was thinking that I need to get some cherries and make this in the fried pie form. - [Theresa] Mmm, I didn't. even think about that - Uh huh, Uh huh. And you know what?. Eddie, they went so fast. The next night I still. had my fresh apples. I had put Fruit Fresh on them so they, they didn't turn brown on me. So, I made another batch. I got 10 more pies done out. of the rest of that fruit. Look at this. Now how pretty is that? That is so pretty Dawn. Sassy Banjo girl. Alright. (cellophane crinkling) So we're going to put. this other pie crust on. And, she doesn't have any recommendations. She said just put the pie crust on top of your cherries. This is some pretty dough. - [Theresa] Thank you, I made it myself. (laughing) - [Paula] Well, you did a lovely job. Alright. So, this is what I'm gonna do. I think I'm gonna do. - [Theresa] what does she say we need to, - [Paula] Milk, - [Theresa] Wash it with? - [Paula] Milk, or we can do an egg wash. - [Theresa] What would you prefer? - [Paula] Uh, - [Theresa] I have no eggs I have none. - You know, let's just do the milk. Like she recommends. How about that? You know how I feel, always follow the recipe. just right the first time. This is very pretty. And I love having that top crust because now it's double and. you've got enough to work with. You know? You got enough to pinch. And how simple. Hey, Gus Buster. Hey, Gussy Gus. - [Theresa] I haven't. seen Gus in a long time. - [Paula] I know! Gus has been staying with Eddie while I was in Bobby's house. His condo. I mean his guest house. So look how beautiful that looks. Is that not a beauty? - [Eddie] That's a deep crust there. - [Paula] That is a beauty, Dawn. Alright, now I'm gonna take. What you want Gus Buster? Say, ""Give me some pie. Give me some pie mama."" (giggling) He hadn't had a treat yet, has he? - [Eddie] Uh, no. - Okay. Well I'm gonna. give that boy a treat. Oh, a treat! Oh! Here comes Lulu. Everybody wants a treat. E'ery-body. Okay. So I'm just going. to brush this with milk. And I wonder if I should put the torinabo, Tur-bi-nado sugar, - [Theresa] I say yes. - [Paula] instead of regular. - [Theresa] I say yes. - [Paula] Okay. You talked me into it Theresa - [Theresa] It was real hard. I even bought of box of this for my house. - [Paula] You did? - [Theresa] Mm hmm, I haven't it used yet, but this could be, this could be my breaking out party. - [Paula] Well, you should. have just borrowed mine. - [Theresa] Yeah, it lasts. a long time, doesn't it? - [Paula] Yes. I would have been happy. to share a box with you. Alright, now I'm gonna to vent this. She didn't say to but, I'm gonna vent it. Like so. I have to get that in my right hand. I have to do it right-handed. Maybe I can. Oh, Oh, Oh! I think we have got us. a new favorite dessert. Wouldn't this be beautiful at Christmas? - [Theresa] Yes - [Paula] Okay. If you love it as much as my family does, I hope you share it. with your channel, also. And I love it. I love. sharing y'alls recipes. I love, love hearing what y'all do. So Dawn said that she cooks her, bakes hers at 475 degrees for 40 minutes. - [Theresa] We said, - Now that sounds a little high for me. - [Theresa] I think that. four might have gotten - Okay, so let me just fix. this one piece on that crust. When you picked it up, I could see it. Uh huh. I could see the sides. I hope I got the top - [Theresa] It looks beautiful. - Mm hmm. I hope the top is stuck to the bottom. You know? - [Theresa] Mm hmm - I might should've. dampened it with water. Ooh hoo hoo, it's just poi-ty, Poi-ty, poi-ty, poi-ty. (laughing) - [Theresa] Is that good? - Okay! See ya'll in 40 minutes. Thank you, Dawn. Thank you, Sassy banjo! Who wants a treat?! (laughing) Oh, look it. Gus you haven't had one of these, you hadn't had this treat. Lulu adores this treat right here. She adores it. And she's gonna share with you, Gussy! (laughing) Well, look at that. How do you like that bacon? That looks good enough to eat. Alright, sit! Oh, you precious angel. Oh, do you want this? Is this what you want? That's what I want mama! (laughing) She loves those. Look at Gus, he's already. gotten in his bed, now. Chewing on his treat. Okie doke, Theresa! - [Theresa] I've been waiting for this. - [Paula] Dawn, you have. made Teresa so excited. Honey, I can't tell you. how happy this girl is. Her two favorite things. in the whole world, besides Keith, alright. - [Theresa] Exactly, (Paula laughing) thank you for covering me on that one. - [Paula] You know what I think I like, this little piece right here. Mmmm. That milk and that turbinado sugar and you, y'all know, I've showed you my little trick about cutting through the tin foil. - [Theresa] I know this is the real deal. I can't cut through this glass pie plate. Hopefully. Thank you, Eddie. - [Theresa] He's been a. nervous wreck about this pie not coming out the. pan, and look at that. - [Paula] Well, it's still kind of, (Paula laughing) - [Theresa] It's still kind of what? - [Paula] You want some Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes. - [Paula] It's still kind of warm. - [Theresa] I still want. Yes, I've been waiting for you. to cut it for like 3 hours. - Well come over here. and pick up your fork. I ain't partin' with this pie. - [Theresa] I mean, 3 hours I've waited. - I know it, dig in sister. You take the first bite. - I just wanna (laughing) - What you say? - That is good. - And you know, it's still, - It's just like chocolate cherry. - It's still warm. - Oh, You know. I like it like that. It's a good blend of chocolate. Wow. It's so easy. - It was so, - [Theresa] I mean, especially since we didn't make the crust, do you know what I mean? Like the crust would be the. hardest thing to make on this. If you made the crust by hand. - There you go, sister. - Gosh, double crust. (laughing) - I mean what more could you want in life? - Mm hmm Alright. I didn't cut that too clean. I left some of the bottom crust on, so I'm trying to pull it out. And I'll give you the. other part of your crust. - [Eddie] I'm curious as. to the stacks of butter that you have beside it. Is that for something? Or? - [Theresa] Oh, I thought. she was gonna slap it on, at one point. - That would be good, wouldn't it? No, I had just been using. the butter for somethin' - [Theresa] It doesn't need it. - And it just stayed there. Not one teaspoon of butter in this pie. Dawn, I've got to figure out how to get a teaspoon. of butter in that pie. (laughing) - [Theresa] Could you have. used butter on the top instead of. - [Paula] Milk? (laughing) - [Theresa] Yeah, I mean. like could you. Like. I mean, would that help it. or does that ruin the pie? - Oh no. Uh uh. This is. fine, just like this. Thank you Dawn. Made our day.

PVjJnR2R2Cw.json;"- Hey, y'all come on in the kitchen. You can tell where my. brain is going, right now. Because I am thinking having three sons that really. love football, baseball, all kinds of sports. So my mind is on things that. they would like for tailgating, or to just mix up for. friends when they come over. Or if you go into somebody else's house, you can make this and give it to them as a little hostess gift. Now I'm going to... In fact, I already have. I've got a ""Crispy Corn. & Rice"" cereal in here. I put it..I had to find. me a bigger container. I've got a half maybe or. three quarters of a cup of smooth peanut butter.. I like the smooth. - Three quarters of a cup? - Three quarters of a cup. I'm going to put a teaspoon of vanilla, a stick of butter and a 12 ounce package. of semi-sweet chocolates. And I'm just going to put. all this in the micro... I'm not going to put the vanilla yet. I'm going to put all of this. in a microwave-safe bowl. And melt it. So this is, if, for those. that like a sweeter snack, this will be the snack for you honey. And uh, (clattering sounds) I've shared a savory one. with y'all too, today. So you can just pick your poison. What ever you feel like. (clanking sounds) Okay. Does this tell me how long. to microwave it for Theresa? I can't remember. - Till melted. - Okay. I don't, I don't have it on here. Just said melt chocolate. and peanut butter together. Pour over the rice cereal. Yum. So, I can't forget to. add the vanilla to this. So... (glass clanking) I'm gonna put this one. for minute at a time, stirring until it's all melted. Okay y'all, it took me three minutes to melt. all this good together. I did it in one minute increments. And you'll want to make sure. that you stirred this very well until it's completely mixed together. And I just added my vanilla. But see how smooth and creamy that is. It's like delicious. All right. So I'm just going to pour this, I don't know if I can do it. I'm just going to pour. this over my cereal. Like I said this is one. of the sweet snacks. (glass clanking) - Not sure you said how. much the cereal was. - It's one box. (crunching sounds) One box of a regular size cereal. (loud crunching) (giggling) Yeah. What did you call it a crispy. - ""Crispy Corn and Rice"". - Yeah. Like I said you can use. kind of cereal you want. - Just whatever you think. your children or your husband will eat and like and your friends. (cereal crunching) Alright. I think I'm going to. have to just get in here with my hands in order to get it, (cereal crunching) mixed up real good. And I'm trying to be gentle. So as not to break up the cereal. (cereal crunching) Looks good doesn't it Eddie. (cereal crunching) It don't look like reindeer. dropping so, does it?. (chuckling) Whoa! Mhhhh! Now, if you're a finger licker,. this would be a good one to sit back and enjoy. licking those fingers. An pound of confectionate sugar. I'm going to try to get in here without putting my hands back in it. So, I think this one will do. (crunching) That's uh, semi-sweet chocolate. So, you really, really, really. need this powdered sugar. Because semi-sweet. chocolate is a little bit on the bitter side. (clanking) Okay So I'm doing the powdered. sugar in like third y'all. (light crunching) Like I said, you just want to be careful to try and not to break it up, break up your cereal. (paper rattling) Okay. (light crunching) That's it. (light crunching) When I found this in my handwritten notes, In my recipe drawer. Oops. (loud laughter) Look what I did. This said, ""powdered sugar"". on it and I didn't know it. but when I found this handwritten recipe in my recipe drawer, it said ""puppy chow"". I said, Oh great. Cause I've been wanting to. make something for the pups. On uh, my little cooking channel. (ringing) Okay. It's time for our. last snack to come out. Right Theresa that's... - How about I come get. that when you finish. - Yeah, you can come get it. - So there we go. It took, it really did take that one pound of confectionate sugar. to absorb that chocolate. Eddie, dig in baby. - Good stuff It's amazing that the powdered. sugar doesn't go away. I know it. It's good, isn't it? The crispy of the cereal. So like I said, this is a great sweet, tailgating recipe, or just have friends over,. you can put this out. They will enjoy. And I'm probably going to go in here and just break it up a little bit more. You know, you may want some chunks. For people that like to get a bigger bite. But there we go. That's it. That is it for the day. Theresa come taste. And when I say puppy chow now, it's just not for the four legged pups. - Oh no. Definitely not. - This is for the two legged dogs. Speaking of dogs, how are the bull dog doing? - Well, we won last. weekend, but it was a... - Okay - It was having to have a comeback, - You know what, - Over on Saturday. - You know what? I don't care if you win by one point, - I know - You're a winner, right? I'll see Y'all later. Loving best dishes.";['postres']

Q2RMfuliFUw.json;"- I love a whoopie pie. How 'bout, y'all? Do y'all like whoopie pies? They have been around since what, the '40s maybe or the '50s? I know I remember seeing. 'em as a young child, so at least 30 years ago. (laughs) Is anybody buying that? (laughs) I don't think anybody bought it, Eddie. No, but they have been around a long time. Personally, I don't care. for the store boughts, but I do love a homemade whoopie pie. And I'm gonna share with y'all a recipe that was in ""Cooking with. Paula Deen"" magazine, and it's a banana cream whoopie pie. So it's really good. So I'm gon' start over here with my sugar, (taps bowl) and there'll be a link, y'all, so you can get all the. correct measurements. Y'all just have to let me know if y'all really prefer me. really reading them out, or you're good with me just telling you what it is without giving y'all the correct amount since you have a link. I got butter on my sunglasses,. on my reading glasses. (laughs) All right. So I'm going to cream my butter, my sugar, and my vanilla. (mixer hums) And I'm just gonna beat. this until it's fluffy, three or four minutes,. something like that. (mixer hums) Now we're gonna add one egg at the time, beating well after each. While Theresa's doing that, and she's giving me extra hands, y'all, (beaters clink against bowl) I'm gonna go ahead and blend in our flour. I think it's two cups of. all purpose, right, Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - [Paula] And baking soda, baking powder, and a little salt.. - [Theresa] I'm gonna go ahead and add in the other egg.. - [Paula] Yes, please. Thank ya. All right, so we don't have to sift this. If you use a whisk on. this, it works real well, almost as good as sifting it. Okay, Theresa, while you're. standing here. (laughs) - I just need a spatula. - You wanna finish helpin' me? - [Theresa] Certainly.. - Okay. You know, that's the only thing about using the hand mixer. is you can't walk off. - No, you cannot.. - With a hand mixer. - Hold on, I didn't get all of this. - Okay, you gonna scrape your sides. - [Theresa] You know, I gotta make sure all that butter.... - She has become a regular Betty Crocker, y'all.

(mixer hums) (taps spatula on bowl) Okay, now we're gonna add a little milk. We're gonna alternate. our flour and our milk. Gonna start it with flour and. we're gonna end with flour. All right, now we got our. parchment paper over here. Now the important thing is. when you're doing whoopie pies, it's very, very important that when you first get started make up your mind how big you. want your whoopie pies to be. And it's important that. you makes every one of 'em the same identical size. (scooper clinks) - [Theresa] I guess my ice. cream scoop's a little sick. - (laughing) It darn sure is sick. - [Theresa] But it works. - Okay, I'm gonna give it almost spray, so our batter will come out nice and easy. All my ice cream scoops. are in storage, y'all, except for my favorite, favorite one that my friends sent me. All right, so that's. what I have to remember about that size right there. (parchment paper crunches) I have made so many of these. in my children's lifetime. Great time of day. I would make 'em and I'd. wrap 'em in Saran wrap and put them in the fridge, (scooper clinks) and they'd bring all the. neighborhood kids in. (parchment paper crunches) - [Eddie] That's a great color. - [Paula] Isn't this a pretty color? - [Theresa] It was my good mixing skills. - [Eddie] Your mixing skills? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm.. - [Paula] Yes, it was. We've got this sheet ready. We're gonna put it in the oven, 350 preheated for 12 minutes or whenever your oven says they're ready. Okie-doke, we gonna finish up our banana whoopie pies. Now I'm just putting these. in a little lemon juice because you know how. quickly bananas can turn. And these are gonna be. going in the refrigerator. I'll store 'em in the refrigerator. So I do want 'em to last a little while. All right, now to get at. filling for our whoopie pie, this was so, so simple. You mixed a cup of milk, a half a cup. Was it a half a cup of half and half? Heavy cream. And then one small. banana cream pudding mix. And was it instant? Yeah, instant. Can't hardly see no more. So instant. Now all you have to do is. mix that together real good. And then you put it in the. refrigerator and let it sit for about an hour and this. is what you're gonna get. (bowl clanks on counter) Okay, so you're filling will. get really, really stiff. Now you wanna turn the bottom. of your whoopie pie up, and then we're gonna put some bananas. Are you guys ready for a whoopie pie? - [Henry] Actually, yes. - [Paula] Who wants a whoopie pie, you? You do?. - [Henry] Yes. - [Paula] All right, not I'm not putting as much on that side, uh oh. (laughs) I'm not putting as much. whoopie on the other side. - [Henry] Yes, please. - Y'all, this is Henry. This is Michelle's oldest son. (laughs) Smile when you tell 'em hey. You're so sweet and so friendly. All right, put you a little of the cream on the bottom of your cookie or your cake. Okay. Okay, you'll wanna spread. that out just a little bit.

Come around here. (laughs) What does it taste like? - Banana pudding. - That's exactly right. That's what it's supposed. to taste like. (smacks lips) It's good, isn't it? (laughs) Kid-approved. - Instead of an ice cream sandwich, it tastes like a banana sandwich. - You know what, I love banana sandwiches, love, love banana sandwiches. So like I said, it's got. Henry's stamp of approval on it. So loving best dishes to. all of y'all out there. John, come have a whoopie pie. You don't want mushrooms on. your whoopie pie, do you? Okay.

This has got gimme. swallowing hard. (laughs) - Is that vanilla flavor? What is it?. - Mm-hmm, taste it. - Banana pudding, yummy. - (laughs) Good! It's got two 10's. Or is it five-star?

q7SuiVPEUFk.json;- Hey, y'all, you know,. it's almost spring time and I know a lot of yall are looking forward to. getting in your swim suits and going to the beach. or sitting by the pool. And let me tell you, I am not one of those but people have been. looking for good salads. So I'm going to share with y'all a fruit salad that I really like and I hope you'll like it too. I'm going to make my dressing first and I'm starting with some orange juice. Let's see how much orange juice, a fourth of a cup, and a third of a cup of honey. And any time you're going to be measuring honey if you'll spray that container that honey comes down so much easier. All right. So I'm going to use let's see how much canola. oil a fourth of a cup. And I've heard a lot of. controversy about canola oil. Y'all have gotten in touch with me. So y'all let me know. It's interesting to hear. what y'all got to say. Now that was- - [Woman] Your lemon juice. - Uh huh the lemon juice. And it was a half a teaspoon. And we have, how many poppy. seeds are we using there? - [Woman] I don't think those go in there, I think those are- - One and a half teaspoons. No, I think the poppy. seed goes in the dressing. Now combine the fruits now in a glass bowl, add the dressing. Let's see, combine the. honey, orange juice, oil, half a teaspoon of. lemon juice, poppy seeds, salt and mustard. - [Woman] The (beep) prep chef is off. - That's all right. - [Woman] And I forgot to put this in here cause it's a logistic. - Yes, I need oh gosh, fourth of a teaspoon of mustard. So I'm not even going. to try to measure that. I'm just gonna do a squirt and y'all pardon the. noise it's going to make. Oh, it didn't make a noise. That was silent. - [Woman] Salt. - All right. And how much salt are we gonna add? Let's see. A fourth of a teaspoon. So I've got a half a teaspoon in here. Let's see if I can find. a fourth, there it is. Fourth of a teaspoon of salt. So that's it for our dressing. We're gonna take this and we're just gonna shake,. shake, shake, shake, shake. Shake it up good. And you can see that honey in there. So it's going to take quite a few shakes. If you got a husband sitting around, - [Woman] I was going to. say do you want me to shake while you do the fruit? - See that big old man. sitting right over there? - [Woman] Eating his salad. - Uh huh. I bet he is saying, I. don't want to shake that. So by hand. Am I right? No, you can work on it,. Teresa, if you want to. - [Teresa] I can shake it. - But it's just the honey that- you can see the honey that's. collected on the side. All right. So that's our dressing. And so we go, we'll come on over here and let me find my lemon. Lemon, lemon. - [Man] There's some of them over here. - Oh, okay, thank you. - [Teresa] And remember I gave. you some lemon juice already. - Oh okay. Thank you Teresa. I had forgotten. - [Teresa] It's okay. - I had forgotten, but that. may not be enough lemon juice. So, I'm going to transfer this to a smaller bowl and I'm going to take my apples and I'm going to core them and cut them like I would for a Waldorf. Salad or an Apple Salad. And my corer is in storage too. Are you all sick of me saying that? I don't know what I'm. going to do when I run out of excuses. That's Teresa and I can't find things. And I am using, y'all, my. favorite Apple in the whole world. And that's a Pink Lady. I adore them. - [Teresa] Look at that lemon. I'm sorry, I just have to say that. - I know it. This is one of the lemons- - [Teresa] That looks like. a grapefruit, in my opinion. - I know. - [Teresa] Or an orange. - It does, it looks just like an orange. And this is off of Bobbies and Clydes lemon tree out there. - [Teresa] They've lasted a long time. Their lemons have really- - Yes and you know what? If I can't use all my lemons,. I don't, I don't harvest them. I just let them to stay on the tree. All right. So we've got our apples our bananas and now we're going to add a. can of Mandarin oranges. So it really doesn't have. to be in the lemon juice but it's important that, - [Teresa] Please be careful. - I'll be careful. - [Teresa] Mom. - Slash. - [Teresa] I don't do blood. - Okay, this avocado is a little green. See because it doesn't want to budge. Whoa, you missed it Paula. Yeah, this one's too green. - [Teresa] We have another. one if you wanna trade it. - Uh uh that's all right, this, this one's going to be good. It's just- - [Teresa] You're not gonna waste it. I'd rather have it this. way, Teresa than mushy. You know? - [Teresa] Yeah, that's true. - So just peel that. little avocado like that and I'm going to put this one in the bowl that we had the lemon juice in. - [Teresa] I taste tested. the salad dressing. It's very good. - Oh good. And it's so easy. If you get a spoon and you. can just run that spoon between the meat of the avocado and the skin and it peels so nicely, but instead of turning. around and hunting a spoon, I'm just doing it this way. - [Teresa] And it's just us eating it. - Uh huh. That's right. We're not taking this. to anybody's restaurant and serving it for sure. Just our family restaurant I thought I just heard. a piece of avocado drop, but I guess not. So to make sure this avocado is well tossed, I'm gonna put it in it's own bowl. You know avocados will turn. dark on you so quickly. So I want to break that apart and make sure it's covered good. Now I'm going to lift my other fruit out of this lemon juice. If you've never had a Pink Lady Apple y'all must try 'em. That you're so good. So this is it. We've just got a few. more things to add to it. - [Teresa] Make sure to add the dressing. - And we are done. I adore raisins, I adore walnuts and I adore our dressing. So this is it. What a wonderful, wonderful salad. And you can substitute. any fruit that you like if you like mangoes or, what is it the children like so much? Look at that. Does that not look wonderful? - [Teresa] Look how fresh that looks. - Uh huh. - [Teresa] Hello, spring. - I'm ready for my bikini. One of the best dishes y'all. You couldn't catch me dead in a bikini. Mmm!;['postres']
Qc_6mQP4pxk.json;hello my dear friends come on into the kitchen with me because i'm working away on our 12 days of christmas cookies and we have finally gotten to one of my favorite cookies that i remember my grandma paul making a lot uh and she called them grandma paul's sand tarts she called them sand tarts i ated the grandma paw uh but i know everybody in the world has eaten this cookie some people call it a wedding cookie some people call it a sandy uh what are some more names theresa that you might know this by but anyway it's that little white like a shortbread cookie rolled in powdered sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven so y'all know what i'm talking about kitties you know what i'm talking about and uh it's as good as any shortbread cookie you'll ever eat so i have two sticks of butter here in my bowl and i don't substitute i use the real deal uh let's see what did grandma used to do okay my two sticks of butter there's really not very many ingredients in this cookie and i think that's probably y'all what makes it so damn gum good so i've got confectionary sugar and i'm gonna beat that with my butter now this is uh that's flour powdered sugar for rolling them in and the flour is for me to get my fingers in so these delicious cookies won't stick to my fingers cause you know i do hate to have to lick my fingers listen i just assume i'm as happy to make these as i am the beaders and the bowl lady what was your favorite christmas cookie eddie that your mama used to make i think um i think the my favorite was the um you know like the egg white uh all the meringues and you know what they're not fattening and they're actually good for you because it doesn't have the yolk in it and egg whites they have no calories but i'm sure your mama put a little sugar in them oh yeah and did you like anything in your meringues uh yes she would put um she would put chocolate chips and raisins sometimes oh my goodness i've never had one crazy it's good yum all right i'm gonna add our vanilla and i'm going to be pretty generous with this vanilla because i really really like it in fact if you um are looking for a hostess gift or you just want to remember somebody that's in your sunday school class or the ladies you played bridge with let me tell you a gift that is so easy to make and so appreciated uh it's homemade vanilla and you can make it using either bourbon or vodka and depending on the the kind of bottle you make it in maybe five to seven uh pods of vanilla and you just split split it down the center and then take a knife and just scrape out all the gooey center to those beans put it over in the liquid of your choice and then stick the beans down in there but here's the deal though you need to start making it like today because if you could if you could let it sit for two months that would be just about perfect but um you put that in a neat jar and put a bow around it i would be so happy for somebody to give me homemade vanilla all right so that's the story moaning glory on that little bit of information now i'm just going to add my flour and we're using all purpose i love a cookie with very few ingredients i like nemo's um christmas cookies that i made earlier but boy heidi it really did have everything but the kitchen sink in it but they were delicious okay so we just want to incorporate this real good i'm gonna turn it up just a little bit so you know let me hear from y'all i would love to know what y'all's favorite christmas cookies are or cookies made at christmas time that you remember your mother or your grandmother making for you uh i'd love to love to hear from y'all man what were the boys favorite you know it's funny but when my boys were young they didn't care too much for sweets and that in that strange of course they love those two brothers chocolate gobs that i've talked about but no they weren't they weren't real big on sweets so all right i'm gonna flour up my hands and i'm gonna get about a tablespoon okay i think maybe i got a little bit more than a tablespoon so grandma call these sand tarts i still got i meant crescent sand tarts so she always made hers i still think that's a little big we're going to shape them like a piece of the moon how does that look eddie looks good now this this reminds me of the uh the greek uh cooking i'm going to redo him crescent huh uh the um greek um people they they make cookies like that in the crescent oh they do like this with the powdered sugar and yes now you can make them in any shape you want to um i normally make them in balls just because it's easier it's faster oh that's more than a moon right there that's a big all right y'all so i did these in different shapes to just show you teresa's mother this is in honor of teresa's mother she made them into fingers because it was easier than making a crescent so we've got some lady fingers lady fingers yeah yeah lady ladyfingers and um i did some in crescent for grandma i did a couple without nuts because teresa just likes a taste of that shortbread and then i did some in balls and nine out of ten times this is the shape that i made mine in again because it was easier so in the oven these go y'all for 40 minutes at 270 i believe it is it theresa 270 okay these magical cookies are out of the oven y'all and i did wind up cooking them for 40 minutes you want one don't you maxi you want a cookie don't you he said i smell something good mama you know it's best to sift your powdered sugar because sometimes it's just can be lumpy and you like it pretty and fine you know for your cookies so we're just gonna roll these cookies and i was just telling eddie and teresa you know i think i'm uh a simplest not a simple ton but a simple list i kind of just like the round cookies you know like you think of wedding cookies and look at these my crescents they wound up being big oh that's a good treat yeah that's for the kitties it's been extra good what did you get a finger or a crescent teresa oh yeah your nutless one although the crescents are right pretty aren't they all right we'll do one of theresa's fingers now the fingers that would be easier to eat you know just slap down on that thing michael grover could eat this whole tray by himself eddie's getting pretty close too oh now gus you smell something good don't you look at these pitiful hungry dogs eddie say i'm so hungry uh oh that one's broken too that's perfect i'd love to give you all some but i don't think that's really especially good for you i think that they heard the word cookie way too many times today saying give me that damn good i've heard you talk about it all day oh these are big crescents so the dough y'all is really not that sweet so you have to have the powdered sugar so you'll know that you've had a cookie something delectable and sweet and i will probably now i will probably wound up running these through the powdered sugar twice go see it that first time it almost melts it almost melts the powdered sugar because you're still warm so i'll just go back and re-dust those just like that on most of my things it says one time very rarely died just do it one time like i i don't think you've ever tasted my little bite-sized cakes eddie uh the lemon blossoms the lemon blossoms and the orange blossoms oh my goodness you make them a miniature muffin tins and then it said to drop them down into this uh powdered sugar sweet glaze and i always did those twice and you talk about good we ought to make some of those one day we will i'm adding that to the recipe oh okay because you talking about easy and delicious and i mean bite size bite size perfect as long as you have about six of them exactly what was that little pecan have we ever made that you remember when people had muffins the mini ones yes have we ever made them by shower i don't think so we've uh let's see i know we've made them like on some of your you know like uh shop hq i think um oh yes we did we did in the airfryer they yeah they're so good they're mmm those are delicious and eddie and i was in america's georgia we were down there to do something for mr jimmy president jimmy carter and um we stayed up a beautiful hotel an older town in america america's georgia is such a point really beautiful place paul i think this is a good one too i just got an email from a woman by the name of karen rock and she would like us here in rock uh-huh i think that's how you would say her last name i could be failed are you okay right she was saying that she would love if we would do some things that could end up being um like care package type foods oh my gosh she is in the military and they do so that would be fabulous wouldn't it yes so karen that too is coming any of the things that we've done today i mean this is a delicate cookie right here but you know it depends on how you pack them now if you did them all like this those would pack up so beautifully uh i know when my bubba moved out to missouri i would send him care packages of my homemade cookies and oh my gosh he enjoyed him so much and he loved taking him into work you know and sharing his cookies with all his buddies one of his favorites was my peanut butter cookie and my extra thin chocolate chip cookie in fact michael was telling me last night he said you know we had made those cornflake cookies and i said michael this might be my favorite new cookie my new favorite cookie and he said oh no paula he said you're thin and crispy chocolate chip cookie it's like no other isn't that a beautiful tray of cookies y'all this one's hard to beat i know hard-hearted horrible cookies you know what it doesn't taste too far off of the corn flakes now it's got that same familiar taste so what do we we have four four cookies

QkAEE5rXh5c.json;- Hey, y'all, I'm craving something sweet today. And I'm going to make something that I hadn't made in so long that I'd like to share. with y'all, and I'm hungry. And that's a butterscotch pie. So I'm going to start y'all by adding half a cup of flour, a cup of brown sugar, corn starch, a tablespoon of corn starch, a little bit of salt. and then I've got my cream over here, my milk, and a couple of egg yolks that I'm gonna temper in to this mixture. Now you wanna mix that up real good, make sure that flour is really worked in with that sugar real good. So this won't lump on us. So, this is going to be a delicious pie. Anybody that likes butterscotch, this is going to move. to the top of your list I bet for pies. Okay, that's worked in there nicely. Now, I'm gonna start adding my milk and I'm going to add it kind of slow so I can get it all. mixed together real good. We're using brown sugar for. this pie versus white sugar because the brown sugar just. it makes it more as you know, more caramel-y or butterscotchy. So this is already starting to look good. And you'll want to do this with your whisk almost the whole time it's cooking to keep it from lumping. And I don't see any lumps. So I'm gonna finish adding my milk. Oh, I almost didn't get a big enough pan. My direction say in a large pan. (laughs) All right, so I've got. this, I set on about medium. I can still see grains of brown sugar. So I'm going keep on at it, until I know that everything. is dissolved in there. Okay Eddie, it's starting. to get thick now. It's kind of a slow process. I turned it up a little bit, now I'm going to turn it back down. So it is getting thick and we've got two egg yolks over here. And we're going to temper. them into our hot pudding mix. Now by temper, we're gonna add some of the hot into the egg yolks because you really really need to do this because it's important. If you just dumped it all in there there's a good chance that. you would have scrambled eggs. And I liked scrambled eggs but I don't like them in my pies. So I think that will do nicely. And then we gonna let that. cook for a few more minutes so we can make sure our egg gets done. There we go, on the road again. I just wanna whisk that egg into a custard and I bet y'all are thinking, I hadn't seen her her put the. first part a butter in there. Guess what? (laughs) - [Eddie] You need butter. - You do it to the - [Eddie] for butterscotch. - yeah for butterscotch. We've got the scotch and now. we gotta have the butter. So there's our butter. And I'm gonna add a. teaspoon of vanilla pudding. I mean, vanilla flavoring. I got pudding on my brain, y'all. That's not much butter for that big all pile custard, is it? Lord I hadn't made this pie in ages. I've forgotten how good that custard is. - [Eddie] So I never really. thought what makes butterscotch? - What Eddie, I'm sorry. - [Eddie] I never really. thought, what is butterscotch? I mean, it's brown sugar and butter. - It's brown sugar but we've got like butterscotch morsels that we're gonna add to this to really kick up the butterscotch flavor. Now, when we put this in. the refrigerator to cool you're gonna want to put it in a bowl and then use some kind of plastic wrap and pat it on top of the custard so that your custard won't. get this hard crust on it. So, that will be our next. step, but we going let it cool. Just a few minutes before we put it straight. into the refrigerator. Okay, I'd like to see that. come back to a little ball, that comes, that comes All right now, I think it's. safe to add our vanilla. You really don't wanna add your vanilla until after it's off the heat because look amidst the spoon I love a little extra vanilla because it will evaporate. if it's actually cooled. So that's our last step. All right, so I'm gonna. take this off of the stove. I'm gonna let it cool for a minute. And then I'm going to. transfer it to this bowl and we going slip this. in the refrigerator. And you know what? To me Eddie, this would. be good in custard cups. You know, not even have. to fool with a pie crust just make individual. little bowls of custard with a dollop of fresh. sweetened whipped cream on it. - It kinda reminds me of crumbled eggs. - Yeah. - Is this sort of like crumbled eggs? - Yeah, it is, kinda yeah, kinda yeah. (mumbles) Okay. - You want me to hold the bowl? - Oh, I think I got it. I'd rather miss and not burn you. I don't wanna burn you in other words. - I knew what you were saying. - All right, so now we're gonna get out. a piece of plastic wrap I'm going press that down onto our custard and that'll prevent that film, that hard film from forming. Cause that does it compliment our custard. Okay, so in the refrigerator this goes we're going to leave it there. until it is completely cool. (door bell rings) Come in! (laughing) That ain't the door bell. See you after it's cooled. Theresa did so good y'all, she put our bowl in the freezer which makes cream whips so much better. And she's got our. whipping cream real cold. - Oops. (laughs) Oopsie. So, now we're going to whip that cream up until it's the right consistency y'all. Fill the top of our pie. And I'm gonna use our. powdered sugar to [Indistinct] A quarter of a cup or a cup [Indistinct] Our whipping cream is to. the right consistency. You can see it forms nice peaks. So now, to bring our pie totally together, we go stirring about a fourth of a cup of butterscotch morsels. Morsels, morsels. All right, let's see (mumbles) A few more. All right now our custard down here, thanks to Theresa is nice and cold and I'm just gonna pour it in. I mean, it's really. thick this white Theresa if you can kind of help me hold that bowl - Sure. - Please because it's heavy. - That came up nicely. - Yes, it did. - Oh, excuse me. I'm I scratching it? - Not at all. - I'm gonna get it all out. - I know. (laughs) - Nobody to be short. on their butterscotch. So we just go and take out our spatula. - Now you told them we used a pre-baked, did you tell them about. the pre-baked pie crust? - Oh yeah, no, I forgot to tell them that, but we used the frozen pie crust for the S, you know,. just the kind you buy it the grocery store in. the freezer department? So there we go. That looks pretty good. I'm going bring that out to the edge. All right, now we gonna put. our whipped cream on top. I think the kids would. love this butterscotch pie, don't y'all think? Don't you think the. children would love it? - [Eddie] I'm sure they would. - [Theresa] But then any. of that, if I had to share. (laughing) - I mean, look, our cup runneth over. (laughs) - [Eddie] That's good, to cover - Our cup runneth over. I'm trying to decide. - Better have too much than too little. - I'm telling you it's. better to have it not need it than need it and don't have it. I'm thinking that I'm. not going to bring that all the way to the edge, because I think it kind of looks nice. So you can see what kind. of pie is, you know? what do y'all think, or you think I'm just afraid to push it because that made a pile of custard. - It'll pile off though. - Okay now for the finishing touch. What do y'all think? - [Eddie] That is a good looking pie. - I think we have done very, very good but here's the only thing, y'all gonna have to. trust me on how it taste because it's got to go. back in the refrigerator and see it a little bit longer so it will cook nicely. Y'all don't mind though. Y'all take my word, don't you? Love & Best Dishes y'all. Okay, I'm fixing to cut. this butterscotch pie that we made earlier, and we use just that frozen shale. So I'm going to take my scissors and cut through that tenfold. And that's going to help. that first piece of pie release itself. So how big you want your pie is where you cut it? You know, I always get. nervous when I make pies and I'm under the gun of a camera because you don't know. if it's going to come out or it's going to flop. But I have a feeling, if this one flops. All right, let's see just. pulled that crust away. - [Theresa] Piece one is always the piece that you give yourself? - Yeah. I guess that came out. pretty good considering the tip got left in there You gotta make sure that you. cut the pie all the way through So y'all, pretty clean. I'm passing out forks. Why don't you come around here for Teresa? - Look here, look out, this is what. Eddie's been waiting for. He won't admit it, but he insisted. - And this is that homemade. pack growth, right? - No this is. - No, the [Indistinct] - It's good. And it's got just enough. butterscotch with the chips in it. We'll save Eddie some. - It's fine, mighty fine. Come on, Theresa. - And we'll save Eddie some - Eddie, does Eddie want some? (laughs) Okay, (mumbles) eat the whole piece, right Eddie? - [Eddie] I'm going to get mine later. (laughing) - Okay, you can have it back. - [Theresa] Thank you. - Love & Best Dishes y'all.;['postres']
QmTJvni0g9A.json;"- [Paula] I love your book, Eddie. what is that? - Well, for Mother's Day, I thought I would make a treat that my mother always made for us. - [Paula] On Mother's Day? She made it on Mother's Day? - Well, no, not on Mother's Day. This was just something that, I would say, you know, after school, when we'd. come home from school, there would always be. something on the counter. - [Paula] My mama would always have warm banana pudding.. - Yeah. - And your mama would have these. And what are they called? - Well, you know, they're just graham- - Good.. - Crackers. - They're called good.. - Graham cracker treats. I guess.. - Uh-huh. - Anyway.. - Tell them about the book. - All the way back when they. made wallpaper like this, when the Earth was still green. - [Paula] When the Earth. was still flat. (chuckles) - I mean, this wallpaper. book, you would have to say- - [Paula] The pages are yellow. - Probably came from, maybe, the 19- - [Paula] Now, was that your mama's? - No, I made it when I was in the- - [Paula] You covered it with wallpaper? - In third grade, we made-. - No. - Actually this was done in fourth grade. - [Paula] So, you. would've been how old, 10? - I would've been 10 or nine probably. But, anyways, for Mother's. Day our teacher said, ""We're gonna make a, you know, a cookbook and bring in your favorite recipe."" - [Paula] Be all for. mothers, for Mother's Day. - I remember cutting out the wallpaper and messing up and having. to have to redo it. And I ended up with this- - [Paula] Picture of perfection. - This ugly wallpaper, yeah. - No, it's beautiful. The pages have even yellowed. - So, anyways, when they used. to make copies, way back when, it was, what did they call. it, a mimeograph machine? - Yeah.. - And, actually, I think it was a sheet and you actually did the carbon copies. - Yeah, you remember carbon paper? - Yeah, we actually had the carbon paper and we had to write on it, and then the teacher would. crank it through the machine. - You old, Eddie. You old. (both laughing) - When I went to school,. we didn't have a machine. - I can honestly say, I. mean, graduating high school, we had to take a course,. in order to graduate, last minute, take a course in computers, 'cause it was going to be. the new thing. (chuckles) And I kept thinking it's never gonna work. Never gonna work.. - Never gonna fly. (both laughing) You should have invested in stock. - Yes. Well, would've, could've. - You'd been somewhere else, though, and you wouldn't have been here with me, so, I'd have cried. - Anyways, this was a treat. that my mother made for us. - [Paula] So, I just. gotta look at this now, 'cause this was your mother's gift. Did you write in it? - I did. Well, at the page it was on. So, anyways, we are doing. graham cracker, crackers, as a little treat and what you'll need is. a half pound of butter. - Okay, so that would be two sticks. - Two sticks, melted. with a half cup of sugar, and you're just gonna stir. it around a little bit, get it all mixed up with the butter. - This kind of reminds. me of that white trash. What is it called that we make Theresa? - Oh, with the-. - Dawn makes it at Christmas. - Saltines.. - Saltine crackers. - Yeah, with saltines. Oh, y'all, the first page in Eddie's book. - Now, that-. - You can show those to some (indistinct) Theresa, please. - [Camera operator] Absolutely.. Maybe, (indistinct). You wanna shoot it this way?. - Yeah. - Yum.. - So it's all just butter and sugar, all nicely melted. The teacher included that and- - It's so beautiful. - If you read through it, it's everything a child, you know, I wish every child could have. everything that's listed. - I'm gonna read this to y'all. - All right, you read and I'm gonna- - Because I've read this somewhere before, a long time ago.. - I just looked up the author and I'll hopefully have the name by the time you're done.. - Oh good. - But it was actually, I think this was written in the 1950s. - It sounds like it would be. And it's, ""Children learn what they live."" If a child lives with. criticism, he learns to condemn. If a child lives with. hostility, he learns to fight. If a child lives with. ridicule, he learns to be shy. If a child lives with shame,. he learns to feel guilty. If a child lives with tolerance,. he learns to be patient. If a child lives with. encouragement, he learns confidence. If a child lives with praise,. he learns to appreciate. If a child lives with. fairness, he learns justice. If a child lives with security,. he learns to have faith. If a child lives with approval,. he learns to like himself. If a child with acceptance and friendship, he learns to find love in the world. That's getting a little faded. - [Eddie] Yeah, the whole. thing is a little faded. - [Paula] Look at that. - But isn't that just wonderful to... - I need to read this every day. - Yeah. - You know, concerning my. children and the grandchildren. - [Camera operator] And this. was a mother's day gift? - This was a mother's. day gift, yes, we made- - I love you, mom. (Eddie chuckles) Love Slugger! Is that what they called you? - No, no, no. That's not my recipe. My recipe is-. - Oh. - Right there. - Oh, so, this is-. - All the kids in the class. - A recipe from all the kids.. - All the kids in the class did their own recipes. - Stuffed peppers, onion. oven fried chicken. I know you treasured this. - Well, you know, I found it. - Hamburger pie, yum. - My mother gave me my baby. book, not that long ago, and that was inside there. - Swank porter house steak. They must have been rich. (chuckles) - Greek cookies, peanut butter fudge. Oh, I love this. So, each child, it was. done in their handwriting. - [Eddie] Yes, we each. had to write a recipe. - [Paula] Pita, rhubarb cobbler. - [Eddie] I went to school. with a lot of Greek children. All right, the recipe-. - Graham crackers. Is that yours, Ed?. - Actually calls for about 25. That one, yeah.. - Yeah. - Called for 25-. - How long did it take you to learn how to spell your last name. (Paula laughing). - Oh, I learned real quick. (chuckles) I learned my ABCs real quick. - Chocolate marble squares. - I'm gonna take these up. - To mom from Mike. Oatmeal cookies, there's two oatmeal. Two oatmeal cookie recipes.. - Yes, I was just reading that and the recipes are very different. - Uh-huh, yeah, one calls for shortening and one calls for butter. - So, I'm gonna use a little bit- - What is this? Is that a Greek word? - (stammers) finikia, yeah. I think it's like the spun phyllo. - Butter, orange juice, sugar. - I am going to use some. crushed toffee on some and some mini chocolate morsels. My mother used peanuts. - [Paula] Oh she did. - So, we're gonna use some crush peanuts. And, you know, usually when. you're going through school, you usually have a favorite teacher and you remember a favorite teacher. Well, my favorite teacher was always the third grade, Mrs. Shea, and everything that we did in. her class just stuck with me. This cookbook was actually. done in the fourth grade but all my teachers, I kind. of judged by Mrs. Shea. (chuckles) So, it was wonderful, when I went into fourth. grade, I had Mrs. Jenner and she was so similar. to her, which was great. - I've just gotta show y'all this. Happy Mother's Day for a. sweet mother on Mother's Day. Thank you for being so. nice through the years. Love Eddie.. (Eddie chuckles) May the 8th, 1981, Friday. - 1981, okay, there you go. - [Camera Operator] And this is gonna be showing Mother's Day. week, so this is perfect. - And you did a fabulous. job with the wallpaper. (Eddie chuckles) I mean, I would expect nothing less. - And we actually did that. I remember putting it in. the press and everything and I honestly remember. messing up the first one and had to do it over.. - It's perfect. I would've thought that. it came that way, Eddie. - Nope. So, okay- - I always knew you were very special. - 350 degrees for about nine minutes and you'll have a tasty treat. - I can't wait to taste them. Oh, I saw all y'all eating them earlier, But I was busy trying to fix. a broken face. (chuckles) Eddie, they look delicious. And it's one of those. simple, simple things that the children can make for. Mother's Day for their mother. - It is and I do remember. making it with my mother.

ingredients that we need to add to our wet ingredients and i'm gonna need two and a half cups of all-purpose flour you have to be precise because bacon is a formula three-fourths of a tablespoon of baking powder and that's gonna make our cupcakes get fat and pretty and now three-fourths of a teaspoon of salt and then we're just going to add them to our wet ingredients and the bowl back goes and then i'm going to take our little mixer and mix up those dry ingredients into our wet ingredients all right now i'm going to turn that up and just whip that on out all right there we go that was simple enough all right i want to load up our muffin tins i'm lining mine with paper because it works out better for a cupcake and i'm just going to put one heaping scoop into the muffin tins and i'm using a medium sized scooper my oven has been preheated to 350 degrees and we're gonna bake these for about 20 to 22 minutes so in they go let's make our frosting that's gonna go in our arnold palmer

qzKSguIgexo.json;"- In case, just in case y'all don't recognize this pretty lady that's in my kitchen today.. - Oh Lord have mercy. - Her name is Lisa Clapp, and you are gonna fall in love with her the same way I did the first time I met her. at one of my book signings. And, I'm gonna make what has become one of Lisa's all-time favorite desserts. - Yes girl. - And boy, hottie. We're going down memory lane because I'm gonna make a Fresh Peach Gooey Butter Cake. - Girl, stop, stop, stop! (Paula laughs) I can't wait, I cannot wait. - Well, this is so easy. - Okay. - It's so easy Lisa. - Put me to work. - Well, I wanna put your mouth to work. - Oh, okay. I'm good at that. I'm real good at that. - I want you... Wait, lemme get this thing. (Lisa laughs) Come on. Unwound.. - I love it. - Okay, here we go. So, I'm gonna start with. just a yellow cake mix. Now you know, it just depends. on what flavor you want. You can use chocolate,. you can use red velvet, you can use lemon or whatever cake mix they got out there. Now I'm just gonna dump this in. And this is gonna be the crust. to our gooey butter cake. - Mm, girl. - And all we need is one stick of melted butter and one egg. I know you're holding the butter. - I'm holding your butter girl. - All right. So now I'm thinking to. crank up this loud mixer and I want you to talk. - Over the mixer? - No, I don't know. I don't know if we're. gonna be able to do it. - Oh why -. - I'm not been here very long. It doesn't take but a minute. - Okay. - I'm just gonna beat this stuff, mix it up and then we go pat it. - You want me to tell you, the first time I actually saw this? - No, I want you to tell me and everybody how you got started with your Facebook. - Oh! Oh, that's easy. I have two sons that I adore. Sort of like somebody I know.. - That sounds familiar. - Right. And when they were. starting to get to that age that I knew they were gonna. both be leaving the nest, 'cause they're four years apart. First one had already left the nest. - Uh huh. - I did okay. I did okay, right? And then we - - How far did he fly from the nest? - Not far but you know, I know not to land in on his nest without calling up hell. - Oh God, yes. - I learned that really. quick and in a hurry. (Paula laughs) So when he - when my. oldest went to NC State, It was about 45 - 50 minutes. down the road, right? - Okay. - But I wouldn't dare just ascend on him and his college life. - No. No, you don't do that Mama. - I missed him terribly but I still had baby boy at home, which is Spencer, my youngest one. So I probably just suffocated. him today up with the tension. - Uh huh. - And he's very like ""Back off."" you know, ""I'm going to bat,"" ""You need to step off my plate."" - He's low-maintenance. - He is. And both of my boys. are in a different way, but here's what I'll tell you. I had a lot of energy and I loved to cook. It's definitely my love language, and so - - Well, living on a farm. - Yes. - How can you not? - Well, you'd be surprised at. people that say they don't, but I love it, and my. momma taught me to cook and I just love it. - All those wonderful vegetables. - Exactly. So, when -. - And meats. - The anticipation, of both. of them being out of my nest, I thought I got to find. something to do that's positive. - Something to do, uh huh. - I wanted to encourage other people and I wanted to teach. other people how to cook. So, I started doing it on Facebook, just as fun, you know? And then, people started really liking it. (Paula laughs) And I was shocked.. - Of course they did. - I was shocked. Shocked,. shocked, shocked. And then when my oldest. was a sophomore in college, I said to him: ""What do you think about me. making this into like a vlog?"" 'cause it's not a blog, it's a vlog. And he said, ""Mama, I think. you'd be great at that."" And I was like - I cannot. believe he just said that. So, I started sharing recipes that are near and dear to my heart, that I used when they were growing up and it just snowballed as far as viewers and followers and all that.. - Yes, yes. It just takes time. - It does.. - Time to build. - But if you're doing something you love, I just think that - - It's amazing that they. call that work, isn't it? - Exactly. (Paula laughs) And I have to do it anyway.. - It's just too amazing. So feeding my family. and people that I love just comes natural to me. I love to do it. - It's who you are. - It's who I am. Yes, Ma'am. - So you have a lot of. viewership now, don't you? - I do. I think, you know,. I don't look at it a lot. I really don't. - I don't look at mine either. - I just don't because I'm. doing what I love anyway. The last time I got a report from my person that does all that, Janet from another planet, it was 320,000. - Oh, that's wonderful. - So, you know.... - That is wonderful. - Listen, the viewers. have been what's made it. - Absolutely. The reason I started. doing this on YouTube, the pandemic set in and I thought: Oh my gosh! What do I - ? And I couldn't get off my mind, people that were in a single-household. - Yes. - Being quarantined alone. - Yes, yes, yes. - And I said, well maybe I. can just shoot some videos and just for a little. entertainment for people. - Yes, and it brightens their day. I see what they say to you. They call you their ""sunshine"" and ""you brighten my day."" And, you know, I love all those folks. - If we can do that for. somebody else in a small way... - Yes, yes absolutely. Absolutely. - I feel blessed about it. - And I can't tell you Lisa, how many letters I've gotten from people saying, ""thank you."" - Yes. - ""Thank you for giving us an opportunity to learn a little bit and laugh."" - Yes, yes, yes! - The pandemic, and them in quarantine. - Yes girl. So there is a lot of women... - Do you like for me to take that? - And just sit it right there. - I just feel so honored. let me just keep - - Oh no, I gotta have this right back. - Oh, well, let me give it back to you! - We not even gonna. have to wash this bowl. - Okay, I like that. - We just gonna be able to use it again. - All right. - And I'm going to need. another stick of melted butter. - Oh, I can do that. Let me get you some butter. - Please get me some butter.. - Yes girl. Okay, I didn't use this stick, but where's our other stick - - We gotta have a whole stick. - Oh, we gotta have a whole stick? - Oh yes.. - I'ma let you-- - Oh, here it is. Here it is. - I'll melt your butter. - Okay.. - Okay? You don't have to pull it out. - It's kinda like being the. cream in somebody's coffee, but I'ma melt your butter. - All right, we got the butter, Lisa! - Yes, Ma'am! I'll do it. - And I'm going to get some. beautiful, fresh peaches. - Yum! - Teresa actually bought these. I don't know where - did. you get them from Davis? - [Teresa] Yes, Ma'am. - Yum!. - Well, they are beautiful. I actually processed. them last night, Teresa. - [Teresa] Ooh! - [Paula] Look at those peaches! - [Lisa] Oh, they look wonderful. - [Paula] Now let me tell. you what I'm gonna do first. - [Teresa] We made peach. ice cream the other day and I made-- - [Lisa] Oh! Home-made peach ice-cream. - [Teresa] And I made peach. cobbler when I went home. - Man, the privilege of. bring in peach country, girl. - Yes honey.. - I love it. - We are. We've got some wonderful,. wonderful, wonderful things for work with in. this area of the country that are just there at our disposal. - Yes, yes. - Alright I know I feel like. I'm walking in circles but... - That's alright. - But one thing about it is. that it's a small circle. - Yeah, I like it. (Paula laughs) I like it. - [Paula] All right, so I'm gonna make a fresh peach gooey butter cake. - [Lisa] Mmm! - [Paula] And like I said,. I did these last night. I processed them last night and put some fruit fresh on them. And now we're gonna just. take these place off. - [Teresa] Did you sugar them? - [Paula] I put a little because I wind up giving these to the triplets. I put just a sprinkle of. little monk fruit on it. - [Lisa] Oh! - Because, that's the sweetener. that I know that Cloud uses. - [Lisa] Mmhm! - [Paula] And she wouldn't mind. - [Lisa] Oh yes! - Here taste that, let. me see if it's sweet. - Oh yes, let me taste some. - They're not real sweet. - No, but they're good! I like 'em! But what did you say you're. sweetening them with? What's it called? - Monk fruit. - Monk fruit! - Uh uh. - And so, that might be a. healthier option If I were like - - Oh yeah, it just has no calories. - Oh! - Look in that pantry right. there, Lisa, in that long one. - [Lisa] Yeah. - Open it up and see if you see some sitting right there; a. little container of fruits. - Oh, I see it. Now, can. you buy this anywhere? - Yeah. - I mean, like, it doesn't. have to be a specialty-stored? - No. - Oh, I'm gonna need a. picture of this before we go 'cause that's a good idea. (laughing) That's a great idea. - Now I'm gonna put... I'm gonna a little sugar. - Since we're going to be eating it. - Uh huh. Since I know the babies are. not going to get things... - All right. - You are so sweet to. do that for the babies. - Oh, listen. (Lisa laughs) Their mother and father is very peculiar. - [Lisa] Mm-hmm. - About what they put in their mouth. - Uh huh. - Their mother is a triathlete. - Wow. - Their father is a purple belt Jiu-jitsu. - Yes. - And they both have beautiful bodies. - And beautiful everything,. is what I'm saying. - They eat very, very healthy. - Yes - I'm just going to drain. this 'cause I don't think we want that much water in our peaches. - I can't wait. - I just wanna make sure I have enough. And you know what else. I'm gonna slip in this? - Tell me. - Some almond extract. - Do you want me to get it for you? - I don't know honey I'm gonna. have to - I may have to hunt. - Oh, that is.. That's vanilla.. - That's vanilla. - [Teresa] Lisa, you where. talking about your Facebook. - I was.. - [Teresa] When we-- - Oh yeah, so I wanna finish hearing... - Well honestly, I mean, a hobby, turned into something. that became a bigger entity and it was not anything that I did. - Had planned. - It was a -- - Not planned. You didn't. - It was a God drop.. It has been a God drop. I have met the nicest people along the road on this journey. and I continue to do so. I mean, people just... It's been a blessing. I don't know how else to put. it, honestly. I really don't. - I know exactly what you're saying. Now, I just put those in a. strainer, and let me sieve. - So keep talking now, Lisa. - Okay, okay anyway -. - I want to know. - So when the Facebook. started gaining interest. - Mm-hmm! - Hurricane Floyd was coming. through North Carolina and that very weekend,. for whatever reason, you know how you worry about your kids especially if they're. not home with you, right? - That's right. - Whatever reason, I was. live talking to the viewers, and it just naturally took course that I talked about the Bible, I talked about God and what he means to us in times of trouble, in times. of storms of life, period. And the viewership went up even more. So, I think... You know, you. were saying earlier about people needing that positive, some laughter, some. entertainment, but you know, I wanna learn something too, you know? - Yes, laughter is so important though. - Yes. - It's so important. Did you know, laughing is. the healthiest exercise you can do for your heart? - Absolutely, I believe. that. I believe that. - Laughter. Yes, so if we can. help people do that I mean... - And it ain't no skin off our back. - No, not any at all. - No skin off our back. - And it's - the whole. process has been a blessing. Blessing is the best adjective I can use. - I know, I know, I know... That you are a real. blessing to your friends and fans that follow you. - Well, I try. - Because you got this. dynamic personality. (Lisa giggles) Those of y'all that are. with her in her Facebook. Gosh, my knives need. sharpening so bad, Lisa. - I just keep it real Paula.. - There you go. - I think that's the biggest thing. - Me too. Some days I'd come in here. and I aint got no makeup or my hair straightened. - Exactly. And you know where I've felt - - But I don't think they care. - Well, I have felt. especially female viewers. They've said things to me like this: ""That gives me confidence. to be able to do that. To watch another woman. just be in her pajamas."" - Yes, yes. - ""And her hair all up on her head and you're cooking for your family or, you know, you're sharing a moment."" And I think it empowers other. people to be able to do that. - Absolutely. - And, why not? I mean... - Absolutely. - We get one chance, right? One. chance to make a difference. And if you can make it. in a small place, great. - And I used to catch a lot of flack when I was on TV for doing that. - Can we take that? (Paula laughs) I love being the sous chef here. - For doing that. For licking my fingers. - Yeah. - Now, I didn't do that in the restaurant when I was working in the restaurant. - Right. - But in my own kitchen. - Right. - Come on, please. - Yeah. - If you say you don't lick your fingers in your own kitchen? - I kind of feel sorry for them. - I'd have to call you a storyteller. (laughing) - I kinda feel sorry. for people that say that 'cause I'm thinking, well, you missing all the fun! - Mmm! Oh my Gosh.. - I mean for real! - [Teresa] So Miss Paula, what. all have you put in there? - Okay so Lisa, we have our. base, that's gonna be our crust. - Okay. - [Paula] That's one yellow cake mix, one egg and one stick of melted butter. - [Lisa] Love it. - [Paula] Now in this bowl,. we've got one pound of 10X, 4X confectioner sugar, whatever. you call it, two eggs...

So I like things that are airy. and that don't stick to me and that they're thin enough. - Yes. Yes. - Cause I ain't trying to be extra hot. You know what I'm saying? - No, I can't do it, Lisa. I can't do it. You know, I sweat. This is where I sweat. From my neck up. - Yes! - I don't sweat under my arms. - Hair, your everything. I know. - My hair will get soaking. wet, won't it, Teresa? - I tell you, it is an issue. - I can walk out there one time and come back in and I'll be wet. All right! - That is looking at yummy. - Ain't that looking good? - May I? (surprised gasps) Oh girl! - [Paula] If you didn't, I'd be so upset. - Girl, what you talking about? - Alright so this is. what I'm gonna add to it. Since we're making a fresh. peach gooey butter cake. - Mm, I won't do it twice, just once. - Oh no, that's all right. You. just use a different finger. - Okay, hold on. (Paula laughs) - Oh, Lord have mercy. - Alright, I'm going to add like a half a tea spoon of almond extract. - [Lisa] Okay. - [Paula] Because almond. compliments peaches and cherries like no other. - [Lisa] Yum, that sounds heavenly. - [Paula] Yes. - [Lisa] Mm-mm! - [Paula] All right so I'm. just gonna beat that again. And I don't know if I got. enough peaches mashed up or not. - [Lisa] Do you need me to mash some more? - [Paula] I don't know. Yeah,. let's put it in here, Lisa. - [Lisa] Okay. - [Paula] Put that in there.. Put those peaches in there. - [Lisa] Oh, and we're. gonna stir 'em into this. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Lisa] Oh yay, okay. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Lisa] I could do that. - [Paula] Okay. We may need some more. - [Lisa] All right! This looks delicious. Don't you just love the color of peaches? - [Paula] Yes. - [Lisa] And I love that you can support your agriculture. around here, you know? - [Paula] Yes, I think. we might need some more. - [Lisa] All right, let's do it. Oh, let me have that.. Lord, don't waste that! - All right, Lisa and I. added a few more peaches and I like the way that looks. You like that? - [Lisa] Girl, yes I do. - [Paula] You like that little. flavor of that little almond. - [Lisa] Love the almond, love it. - [Teresa] So Paula, how many peaches would you say that was? Maybe four, five? - [Paula] You know,. peaches are like girls. They come in all different sizes. (Lisa laughing) And that was probably.... I think it was two cups? - [Lisa] At least. - [Paula] Mashed? - [Lisa] At least. - [Paula] But you just put what you want. - [Lisa] Golly that looks good. - [Paula] Look at that. - [Lisa] Don't you dare;. can I lick the bowl? - [Paula] Oh, gosh,. I'll leave some in there so you'll have something to lick. - [Teresa] Now Lisa's. about to get in trouble because she's trying. to take over my stuff. Oh, my gosh. - Normally Lisa, waste not, want not with me. I'll clean that bowl that. way, don't even need washing. All right, we're going to. put this in the oven, y'all, at 350 and we're gonna bake it. Now here's the risky... Not risky... This is where sometimes. people make mistakes. Look at you! - Listen! (Paula laughs) I would have licked that - Fine, I'm good! - People, because the more cake is in it, - Yes. - You think, well, it. should be like a cake! - Yes. - But it's not. You want that center to. jiggle just a little bit. - Okay. - The biggest mistake people. make is overcooking them. - Okay. - So I say anywhere from. 40 to 50 minutes, maybe, you know, depending on your oven. But I have a feeling. that ours is going to be, because of the peaches we put in it, - Yes. - it is going to juicer so, we might have to. cook a little bit longer. - I like juicer. - So, in the oven, I'm going to set the timer. for 35 minutes y'all, and then we'll go from there. But I have a feeling if Miss Lisa and I have. to eat it with spoons... - We will! - We will! - Okay, it's ready Lisa! - Oh it smells... - I want y'all to look at this. Now see how it's jiggling some? That being that we use fresh peaches Lisa? That produced a lot of juice. So I had to cook this one longer. - Can I touch it too? - Please touch my gooey. - [Lisa] Oh! Yes, yes! - But we can't cut this. now while it's hot. It's way too hot. - Right, right. - But it would just. ooze and run everywhere. But when it cools, it's gonna firm up. But remember, the name. is gooey butter cake. So it's supposed to be kinda gooey. - Mmhm, I can't wait. - And I'm just sick that we can't cut it. But I'm glad y'all get to. see that little jiggle. - I think that's the main point. - Right there in the center. See that little jiggle? That's what I want, a little jiggle. There is no way Lisa, that I could cut this. right now and it work. - Smells good. - Do you think we could just taste it? - I noticed you found some spoons! - Girl, yes! Just a little. - Go ahead, you're my guest. - Can I go in first? - Please go in. - [Teresa] Lording the corner. - This jiggles about like. my stomach sometimes. (Paula laughs) But I don't care. I really don't. - Alright now I hope you got. some peaches with that bite. You may have to... - I'm gonna blow it just a little bit. - All right see now, I'm making sure I got the cream cheese. - Oh, it all smells good. - Oh, it's hot. - Bon appetit. - Bon appetit y'all. - Oh, wait a minute, it's. temperature hot, hold on. - You can't do it. You'll. skin your mouth, Lisa. - You know, I skinned it before. - You've 'skunned it before? - I've 'skunned it and I'll. skin it again probably. Mm, I got peach! - Good! (Paula laughs) - Georgia peach! - Good. - Love it. Oh my gosh. - Mine is still way too hot. - I can't wait for y'all. to try it too. Delicious. Mm, girlfriend. - I bet you, we have. cooked a gooey butter cake in 50 to 75 different flavors. That is no kidding. So, you know, you can. play with your bases, your different kind of cakes,. your different fillings. You can just do it. anyway you can think of. - It's delicious. I love it. Thank you so much. - I've enjoyed you being. here so much today Lisa - Oh my gosh. - So, so so so so soo much! - If my husband wouldn't. miss me, I'd just stay. - Okay. (laughing) - Mine's out of town, so - (Lisa laughs) - I would stay up, I think I really would. - This reminds me of a. cuttable peach cobbler. Loving best dishes y'all. Bye! - See ya!";['postres']
r0Tid6KdIdY.json;- Hey y'all! I've got, I don't know if it's sweet, it's kind, it's thoughtful, it's funny, but I've got a message for y'all today. I had a strawberry and. cream pie on the website. And when these get put on,. I'm not doing the typing. So it can go up any, so screwed up, y'all. So messed up. I hate when that happens. because I don't wanna pass along anything that. doesn't work for y'all. Whether it's my fault, their fault, or whoever's fault it. is, it doesn't matter. It should never happen. But I've got a friend out. there that I've never met. And her name is Courtney Lee. Courtney followed the directions that I had for the strawberry cream pie. It failed. And Courtney fixed it. And she sent out a message to y'all saying this recipe that I'm. gonna give you, the amounts, that will take it from failure to a hero. So Courtney, thank you, honey. If I'm not aware of something. wrong I can't fix it. So I appreciate you caring enough and taking the time to. help me get that fixed. You're sweet. And after you got all. the measurements correct, it's got a lot of five stars on it. So thank you, girl. So put that in your trash pile. if it's the original recipe and only use the one. that Courtney has fixed. So thank you, Courtney. So we've got an eight ounce package of softened cream cheese, a stick of butter that's. at room temperature. We've got a cup and a. half of powdered sugar. We have one cup of a. frozen whipped topping. We've got a teaspoon of vanilla and we've got two teaspoons of sugar. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna beat all this up until it's fluffy. And then we're gonna put it. into a prepared pie crust. Now you can use, like I'm gonna use a graham cracker which is really good. Or if you have a frozen. pastry, or you wanna make your own crust, that's up to you. So any kind of crust. You could even do a chocolate crust. If you like chocolate and strawberries. So. Here we go. In the bowl and I'm gonna. mix these two first. Since they're the harder. of our ingredients. Can see Theresa had these. at room temperature, so they are mixing together. Just perfect. All right, now we're gonna add the cup and a half of powdered sugar. All right, now I'm gonna. add my teaspoon of vanilla. Why do they make these. so hard to stand up? I don't know. So a teaspoon of vanilla. And then I'm gonna add my. two teaspoons of sugar. And then I'm gonna add my cup of... Whoops. I'm going to use my cup of... How come they... Look, that makes me so mad. - [Theresa] I don't know why. - I don't know why they don't make it where they won't stand up. All right, and this is a cup. of my frozen whipped topping. And we're just gonna. beat all this together and then we're gonna put it in our crust. And we're gonna let it set. The recipe that was printed, y'all, on the website had raw eggs in it. And I don't know why in. the world you would find a need to put raw eggs. in this refrigerated pie. Okay. And this dessert is so easy. And when we get through. putting the strawberries on. It's gonna be, look look! The butter packet was stuck to my... (Paula laughs) Okay, so I think that's all we need. Theresa's filming today,. y'all, instead of Eddie. - [Theresa] And Eddie is much. better at this, so please- - No he is not! - [Theresa] He is. He's very good at this. - No, listen, you've been. at it a long time too. You be good too. Doesn't that look pretty? Tastes pretty too. I was gonna say something,. now what was I gonna say? - [Theresa] Tell them what Eddie's doing. - Oh yeah, that's what I was going to do. So y'all. My first time searching for wallpaper. I immediately found the one I wanted. And I didn't look any further. Well Eddie did some research. And come to find out, he. came back and said Paula, that's $1,000 a roll. and you need 22 rolls. I said well we're not. getting that wallpaper. And Eddie said Paula, I can. paint that on the walls. I said well that's wonderful. You know, he graduated from. SCAD which is an art school. So he started painting,. putting the wallpaper on my bathroom walls through. the brushes of paint. So I can't wait to show. y'all when he's through. We've kind of gotten behind on him having time to get in there and paint. So that's what he's doing today and he passed the camera on to Theresa. I cannot wait to show y'all what Eddie has done when he's through. The rate we're going. though it may be a while. Look at that. Look at that. Beautiful filling. And I don't think, how long does it say for us to refrigerate it, Theresa? - [Theresa] It just needs. to set for about 30 minutes. - [Paula] Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think this is gonna... - [Theresa] And then we. can put the toppings on it. - [Paula] Take that long. - [Theresa] But then it does have to go in the refrigerator for about four hours. - Yeah. This is a nice summer dessert, y'all. You don't have to turn. on your oven to make it. - [Theresa] Paula, this is actually gonna air the week of 4th of July. - Oh gosh! - [Theresa] What a great- - This is perfect. You know, I'm celebrating the 4th of July. On the cover of one of my magazines that's really been good to me. and that's Woman's World. And it should be coming out any minute. You know, they bring them out early. They don't wait 'til the 4th of July to bring them out, but. there's some good recipes in that magazine, so. keep an eye out for it. I hope you like it. Okay. (water running) In the refrigerator this goes. And I'll peep in on it. in about 45 minutes. So now we're fixing to do our layering. And I'm gonna do it just like Courtney recommended in her redo of this. I'm gonna layer it with. sliced strawberries. A layer of whipped cream. And I'm using the real deal whipped cream. And for every cup of cream that I use, I like to use a fourth of a. cup of sugar to sweeten it. So I'm just gonna make sure. this is a fourth of a cup. - [Theresa] She doesn't. trust my measuring. - No, I mean, it's so easy.. - I'm kidding. - Your measuring and my measuring. But that, yeah, that's a fourth of a cup. So I'm gonna beat this a little bit. So we're just gonna start layering. Which way do I wanna point them? I think maybe like that don't you? Almost feel like I need tweezers. (Paula chuckles) Least I get these all screwed up. - [Theresa] Paula, while you do that. - Yes. - [Theresa] I'm gonna take a break so we can check on what's in the oven. - Okay, perfect. I'm not having to be as particular. With the inside like I was on the outside because we're gonna cover. it with whipped cream. Oh my gracious. This is so pretty. And I can't use but. half that whipped cream because we're gonna put. another layer of strawberries. Another lawyer of. strawberries, so I'm gonna need more whipped cream. for the next layer. Okay. All right, so to me what makes this so great for the 4th of July, Theresa, is you could always come. in with some blueberries. I mean to me this is pretty. with just strawberries, but you could come in with blueberries and have the red, white, and blue. I forgot to put the. strawberries in the center. That's all right. That is all right, Paula. Ann, you just keep... - [Theresa] We were so busy. talking about blueberries. - And laughing. Lord have mercy. - [Theresa] Well that's one thing I love that you show is it's okay to mess up. - [Paula] It is okay to mess up. - [Theresa] and this isn't. gonna taste any worse. It's actually gonna be better. - [Paula] You know, stuff happens. It just happens. Sometimes, girly. All right, now I wonder what I need to do if I need to just cap it with some pretty whole strawberries or, let's see. - [Theresa] I was gonna. tell you, if you wanted to do your sliced. strawberries around we could take a second and I could. get you some blueberries. And we have fresh blueberries. - Oh do we have some here? - [Theresa] We do, yes. - Yay! - [Theresa] So we'll be right back. - Yes, I think that would be wonderful. So I'm gonna keep doing... I'm gonna just keep doing this. All right. Courtney, Courtney, Courtney. Thank you for giving a girl a hand. This pie is beautiful. Like I said, perfect for the 4th of July. The longest part is just. putting your strawberries around trying to keep them even, but. look how beautiful it looks. It looks like a flower that's in bloom. And Teresa had blueberries. So now we've got the red,. the white, and the blue. I am so happy and thrilled. To celebrate the 4th of July, y'all. There's a lot of men and. women out there that fight. For us and our freedom. And. To me the 4th of July. represents our freedom. So isn't that pretty? Can you get over it? - [Theresa] Oh yeah. Look how gorgeous. And now- - [Paula] The best part is. it's gonna taste so good. - [Theresa] But you have to wait now. - [Paula] Yes we do. - [Theresa] Tell them how long. - Two hours? - [Theresa] Take that up some. - Three hours? - [Theresa] No, actually. they recommend six hours. Four to six hours for it to set. - We'll be sleeping in six hours. - [Theresa] We won't. - Well that is just beautiful. Beautiful beautiful. And if I say so myself,. for me and Courtney. Courtney Lou. It's time to cut the. strawberry and cream pie. Thank you for fixing the recipe. That was on the web. I appreciate it so much. I think it said to. leave this in the fridge for like six hours, you. know, to let it set. But. I think it's been about six hours now. All I got to do is find my pie scooper. So you can see why I said this would be a wonderful 4th of July dessert. I was lucky enough that. Theresa had some blueberries. And these beautiful strawberries,. it looks like a starburst. And let's just hopefully. That it tastes as good as it looks. These crusts can be hard. to cut all the way through. And remember how I told. y'all I cut the tinfoil to get that first piece. out a little easier? (Paula laughs) I think it's ready. How's that for a beautiful slice of pie? I'm gonna steal a blueberry or two. Red, white, and blue. God bless you. Really looks good doesn't it? The last layer on top is. the sweetened whipped cream. - Courtney Lou! It's delicious and I can't thank you enough, girl, for helping me. I need all my friends' eyes. on everything to help me. Mmm-mmm-mmm! I wanna go back and give. Michael a bite of this. He's gonna love it. So fresh. So summery tasting. And we made this without. turning on our oven. Which is great because when. it's 100 degrees outside the last thing I wanna. do is turn on my oven. So I send y'all a whole bunch. of love and best dishes. I think if you make. this for the 4th of July celebration nobody will be disappointed. So there you go. Love and best dishes, y'all.;['postres']

Ri3T2zcwQFY.json;"- Hey, my dear friends. To refresh your memory,. I am doing the 12 days of Christmas cookies. So the next one that I. want to share with y'all is really very good. And it's called Memaw's. kitchen sink cookies, and Memaw happens to be Brooke Deen, my daughter-in-law's grandmother,. who's no longer with us, but she did love her. Memaw so very, very much. And so I'm proud to share. this recipe with y'all because it comes from MeMe. with a whole lot of love. I didn't get to meet her, but I understand that she. was just one fine lady. So let's get started. We have our all purpose flour, and I am going to add to this, our salt, our cream of tartar and our baking soda, not powder, but soda. So I'm just going to. give this a little stir. When you're working with. flour and adding other ingredients to it, if you'll use a whisk, it almost acts like a. sifter, which is good. Okay so there we go,. that's mixed up real good. Now our first step is to cream our sugars. So that's white sugar, Brown sugar. And remember they will, the recipe will appear. on this recipe, right? - [Eddie] Oh yeah, yeah, there's a link. - Yeah, a link, that's. what I was trying to say. There'll be a link-- - [Eddie] for the measurements? - Yeah, for the measurements. Help me Eddie, help me Eddie. I'm trying to do two things at once, talking, unwrap butter, and those things are. getting harder and harder. I don't know why. (chuckles) Doing two things at one. time is getting harder. All right. And we're just going to. cream these up real good, it'll take just a few minutes. My stepdaughter, Michelle, she continues her family's. tradition and that was making, Oh my gosh, I bet they make. 10 or 15 different cookies. And they start in October baking them. She texts me the other day and she said, we're in the kitchen, starting. the Christmas cookies. And I said, well, it's not Halloween yet. She said, well, we. always start this early. And they put them in the freezer. So when Christmas comes around, they get together and take. a bag to family members or school teachers or something like that. But anyway, it's nice that. they have just a little love gift to give to. her friends and family. Alrighty, this is creaming. pretty good, y'all and I love Memaw's name. for this: the kitchen sink. Okay, the next thing we're. gonna do is add our oil, and this looks like a lot, but that's what's going. to make it so good. And we're gonna add our egg. You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to crack your egg over your bowl of ingredients. because if that egg was bad, I'd had to start it all over again. So I made a booboo y'all. Okay, look at this, look. at this, look at this. So Memaw says to add your flour. in three times. (chuckles) What am I trying to say, Eddie? - [Eddie] Three increments? - Yeah, three increments,. thank you. (chuckles) All right, so Memaw tells us: don't forget to stop and. scrape down the sides. Make sure everything gets mixed up good. I cannot wait for y'all. to make all these cookies. I tell you what, one of the best cookies I. have ever put in my mouth was sent to us by a photographer. that worked with us opening up Paula Deen's Family Kitchen in Nashville, Tennessee, Phillip. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness, you've. got to watch that video. I'm addicted to that cookie. And you will know the name. of it: corn flake cookies. They're better than any butter cookie you have ever, ever eaten. In fact, we gobbled them all down, like two recipes and they. ain't a cookie in sight. What you shaking your head for, Eddie? - [Eddie] I've got some hidden. - You've got some hidden? You little buzzard. I didn't see you hide any. Okay so I'm gonna turn. this up a little bit. I'm gonna get all that mixed up real good. You see I'm going around. the sides of that bowl Make sure all of that gets incorporated. Okay, Memaw says to just. beat these in lightly. I would almost think you'd want. to fold that because I would think beating them is. gonna break them up some. - [Eddie] Now what is that? - This is rice krispies. and they are not frosted, they're unsweetened and this is oatmeal. And I'm almost thinking, we'll. see, let's see what happens. That's on the only lowest speed we've got. And I think that's all I'm going to do. I think I'm actually. going to fold in the rest. I'm going to try to sling. some of that batter off the beaters and not get me and Eddie Did I get you Eddie? I didn't get me.. - [Eddie] No, no. - All right. Yeah. So I'm just going to fold that. in so it won't get crushed. Cause I do like the, that's what makes those. cornflake cookie so good, Eddie-- - [Eddie] Got that crunch? - Uh-huh, yeah, it's. got that crunch and you, I don't know, and you beat. the, you fold those corn flakes into your flour mixture very gently so they don't get crushed up. You gotta go find that video. y'all and make those cookies. Your family would be so happy. All right now I'm gonna stir in coconut. And then after this, I'm. going to see if I can get the kitchen sink unhooked. and put that in there. Cause it calls for a kitchen sink. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Don't do that kiddies. So I'm going to drop these on. tablespoons by the tablespoon and bake them in the oven. This is one of those ingredients. that makes it so good, y'all cause these are. crunchy and this is just bits of brickle. And you can buy this in a. chocolate covered brickle too. just the plain English toffee. I'll put this in cakes, cookies, whatever I'm doing at. the time that's sweet, because they really add a lot. to any of your sweet pastries. And you can see this dough is real thick. And now Memaw tells us to cover this and let it sit in the. refrigerator for one hour. And I don't understand that. part because the dough is plenty thick enough. And I may just try. foregoing that step. Eddie, what you think? Why not, right? - Well, Hey everybody. I'm Bobby Deen and I'm here with my mom. - Look who walked in, y'all! - Look everybody. - I was so excited to see Bobby walk in. - Aren't you still excited? - Yes I am. - Your lipstick is just--. - oh. - Can you get close on that, Eddie? - No! (laughing) - Deserving of a close-up. It's got that crazy lady look. - When it runs into those wrinkles. - Where it's just kind. of just dripping down. - One day you're gonna have. lines around your lips too, but hopefully you won't have. a problem with lipstick. All right., So here I am. - So anyway, what I was gonna tell him, I don't even think you knew. that I was doing the 12 days of Christmas cookies. Did you even know? - I didn't know it, but I just. came over on the right day. I love cookies and I love. the 12 days of Christmas. - And you love your mom.. - And I love you. - Okay, great. Well, before you go-- - What day is this? - Thursday. - [Eddie] It's the second day. - No, is it the second? I thought it was like third or fourth. - [Teresa] Well, we're. not really playing that. - Okay, we're not doing. it that way, y'all. - There's the boss. There's Mrs. Clause. - [Paula] Ms. Producer. - What day is it, Teresa? - And Mr. Director. - [Teresa] We're not. locking into which day these are getting posted. - And I'm their puppet. - So this'll be whatever. day it happens to be. - [Teresa] It'll be one of. the 12 days of Christmas. - But I do like that there's a theme and I do like that's it's the. 12 days of Christmas cookies, that's really great. - So I made these up, Bobby,. this is Memaw's Kitchen Sink Christmas cookies. And 'cause Memaw was Brooke's grandmother. You know, she adored her grandmother. - I misunderstood because. you said you made these up, but what you mean is you made this batch, you didn't create this recipe. - Right, and it had to sit in. the refrigerator for an hour so it's gotten stiff. But after we bake them off,. there's still another step. I think that's why Memaw called. these kitchen sink cookies. - After they're baked. off. there's another step? That would be called eating, right? - [Paula] No, before we eat. - [Bobby] There's. another preparation step. - So I got, I started dipping. them up using that tablespoon. So if you would finish, Bobby. I will, I will, but first. I wanna show everybody how awesome this tablespoon. is, isn't it, right? This is some of moms,. your, your products, right? And this goes back a few years. This is not new.. - Many years. This goes back a little ways,. but it's just that beautiful hammered look.. - [Eddie] Pewter. - Yeah, pewter. - And you know, this. is for dry ingredients, measuring dry ingredients. - [Bobby] Do you have more for wet? - Uh huh, and that's the. standard measuring cup, you know, with the spout? - I've got one. - That's for liquids. - And the shape goes like this. Cooking lesson's over! - [Teresa] Did you know. that in real life, Bobby? - I did, yeah, I've got two different Pyrex brand measuring cups. - [Teresa] 'cause she's. busted me out because I did not know that. - The one that's made for. wet is obvious because usually they have like--. - You got a spout. - Well, both mine have spouts,. but they may both be made for liquid, but one of. them is shaped more like an upside down volcano;. that's the one for liquid and it's got a sticky bottom. on so it doesn't slide. - You and Teresa can have a measuring cup conversation later. - All right, so after. Bobby gets us baked off, we're putting them in a 350-- - How many rows, three rows of four? - Yeah, like four. What was I saying? Now you done cut me off. In a preheated 350 degree. oven for about 15 minutes. Now make sure, it's very important, Bobby, that your cookie batter. hits the cookie sheet. all the same size. Because if you've got. a bunch of dough here and not much here, well. then the one not right here with not much is going to get done quicker than the one with a lot. So you want them to all get done-- - [Bobby] It's called uniform, son! - [Paula] Uniform! - So Merry Christmas everybody. It's almost Thanksgiving. What are y'all going to do with that? What are you going to do for Thanksgiving? Not gathering obviously, right? It's going to be small, small little, I guess Claudia and I are. going to eat pine cones with our children. - I know it! Y'all gonna be eating. pine cones and pine straw. - That's what my brother. always says about me. Everybody makes fun of. me and that's all right. It's all right. - They eat so healthy and so natural. - Compared, compared to everybody else, that's what they're talking about. - We feel like all they. do is go out in the yard-- - And eat pine cones,. that's my brother's joke. - Pick up sticks and eat sticks. - Y'all just eating pine cones. What are you talking about? - [Eddie] Aren't we going to. his house to eat pine cones? - Well, we got plenty of. them so y'all can all come as long as you stay socially distanced and outside the gate. You can eat the pine cones that fall out of the neighbor's trees and. you can peek over the gate if you got a stool. - You are too good to your family. You know that, right? I'm sure you've been told. Y'all want to give away the secret. You wanna tell the truth now? You live at my house. - I do, y'all because we sold Riverbend and it just, as you get. older, you just don't want that kind of responsibility. of that much property. Five acres was tough. But so anyway, we never sold this Dogwood. house because this is where Michael and I met, this is where he lived. his whole entire life. - I'm not Michael. So, you know, we just. never wanted to sell it. - Yeah and tt was a good. choice because look how beautiful this house is. it's always been special to me. It's always been special to. me because we shot all of Paula's best dishes here. So much of Paula's home cooking, and this room over here behind Eddie that he's about to show, like I can just see Gordon. Elliot and his crew. - [Paula] I know, I was. just talking about that. - [Bobby] In there and us just laughing and having the best time. - [Paula] Kids sitting on. there playing the guitar. - [Bobby] Yeah, this is. where I got a buddy that, that plays major league baseball,. his name's Albert Pujols, and he and I shot. together in this kitchen. - Yeah and then he came. and shot a show with me. - Then Albert and I went and. played the golf tournament down in Brunswick, Georgia. with another baseball buddy, named Adam Wainright,. who's from this area. And golly, Mama's had so many. special and important guests and different kind of people. in this house and in here making food with her and it's just, you know, we talked about this. when Mom was getting ready to move out of the big house. over there, the Riverbend house and this was a conversation we had, aren't you gonna miss. it, don't you feel bad? Yeah, go ahead and put those in there and I'll do the second one. You know you're gonna miss. it, there's just so much important stuff that happened here. And this is all just so great. I like this house and this. property so much better. I've got many more-- - That's what all of. you children have said. - I've got many more. important memories here than at Riverbend. Yeah, that's true for me. - Oh I'm so glad. Michelle and Anthony are so excited. - Oh I'm sure, it's like a homecoming. - Right, it's like going home again. - This is, you know, this is for me, this is just mom's house,. you know, for a long time. But, but for what you're seeing right now, you see this picture of. the chicken up there, and then the painting, pictures. And then the, you know, the wood burn oven And like, this is the. iconic, this is the set of your TV show for years. and years and years. - Probably almost 10 years. - It's a pretty special place to me. All right, so these cookies. are coming out like perfectly. I'm not having any problems. What's the next step? - Well, I just made myself a double bullet using a glass bowl. And it's sitting on top of a pot. The water is not touching the. bottom of that bowl though. You want to make sure. - Good old double bullet. Hey, let me tell y'all something. - Wait, wait, wait, one second, son. - Sorry, you got enough cookie dough here for 25 Christmases. - Oh, and you're just getting started. - I am? Who are we making cookies for? America's Second Harvest? - That would be a good idea. - That would be a good idea,. we should deliver some. America's Second harvest. is the local food bank here in Savannah, Georgia,. and my brother, God bless him, He's a great guy, he just really is. He's got, he's got, he's very, he's got a very community. oriented mind and heart, and he's worked with America's. second harvest for years. You and I have done some stuff there too. And something that is. really special for us too, is we like to, well, I've. already started to say it, so I'm going to say it, but sometimes when you do things. and then you talk about it, it sort of robs away from the. fact that you're doing it, but we'd like to do some work. with, with salvation army too. So the reason that I'm saying that is, is not to toot your horn or hours, but maybe suggest to you all out there, if you're trying to figure. out something to do for the holidays this year to make. something really special, if you visit a salvation army. or America's second harvest and donate your time or some goods, it'll really do you a lot. - I don't ever think. of publicly announced. - Yeah, well, it's. different 'cause I did it. It's kind of natural because. I was just thinking about it. - That gave me so much. pleasure through the years to watch those children and to hug their mamas and their daddies. And I remember one man, his. wife had died and he had like three little children. and he stood up there and hugged me and cried. I cried with him. I've got some good memories. - You've done a lot of. good for a lot of people. All right, what's next? - What's next is I forgot to set a timer. All right, so we've put. our cookies in a 350 degree preheated oven and Memaw said. to bake them for 15 minutes. Well, I've probably had. those in two minutes already. So I'm going to send them a 13. And you know, the time. will fly just like that. - Always does. - So I told ya that I. put my white chocolate. I had the bag, where'd it go? Okay, let's show everybody what I'm using 'cause there's one more. step, y'all to these cookies. And one of these ain't going. to be enough for that bucket full of dough.. - Lot of dough. - Lot of dough. - All right, what you want me to do? Well, we can kind of wash. the dishes and just wait for 15 minutes to pass. - I didn't come to wash no dishes. I do that at my house. - Well you sit there and. watch the clock then. Okay, now we're fixing to finish Mema's kitchen sink cookies up. The last step is to dip them in our melted white chocolate and then sprinkle them with crushed peppermint. How does that look, Bobby? - It looks very very. good, I would like one. - Memaw is a winner. - [Bobby] Not just yet. - Oh, okay, well, you said you wanted one. - I do, but you see, I still. need to go to the oven. - I love this. Now that that white chocolate, y'all, is gonna get hard again. So you'll be able to put these in. Bobby, you want to do this? This is fun. - Is it? Is it, Tom Sawyer? - Your children are gonna love this. Tom Sawyer. (laughing) - Wanna come paint my fence? It's fun. - I love these cookies and. they're just the perfect size. You know, you can eat. three and you just say that it's real tiny. - Just want three more. All right put some of the--. - Oh okay. - I'll dip them and you load them up. - You dip 'em, I'll stick 'em. - With the peppermint. You just kind of drop it down in there. - Uh-huh, yeah, that's what you do. Oh, you did perfect on that one. Look at all that. I love it. I hope the child will get in. the kitchen and try some of these recipes that my family. and are sharing with y'all. You know, they've been tested. They are tried and true honey. So join me in our 12 day. of Christmas cookies. Love and best dishes, y'all. Bobby, tell them love. and best dishes, son. - We'll see y'all again soon. - He ain't gonna say it. - That's your line. - Well, what's your line? - Bye, y'all.";['postres']

s4vKD7yvsrc.json;"- Love love, love, love,. love hearing from y'all. This recipe comes from a fan out of, let me see where she is from, from, from, from, from, Indianapolis, somewhere up in there, so. Her name is Myrna Nisenbaum, and Myrna, you were so nice. to show me how to pronounce your name, because it's N-I-S-E-N, and she said, nice in baum. So thank you so much. And this strawberry pie. recipe that she sent to me, she said, it's so good. during the hot summer months when strawberries are coming in so good. And she said that her. mother cut this recipe out of the Indianapolis Times, or. either the Indianapolis Star, Myrna said she's not quite. sure which one, but she said, ""I have the original cut. out recipe from the paper."" And they made it every Mother's. Day and every Father's Day. And she said, ""I still make. it, and I'm 67 years old now."" Well, baby, you're a. young chick. (giggles) You are a young, young chick, Myrna, and it sounds just delicious. And she says, she goes on. to say, ""This is so good and refreshing in the summer,. but good all year round too."" And she said, ""I love you and. your cooking shows, Paula, I missed you on that other channel, but was so happy to find you on YouTube at the start of the pandemic last year."" She said, ""I can't wait. to watch you every day. You make me so happy, and. helped with the isolation of the past year. You're sunshine personified, and I would love to meet you one day. I love down-home cooking, no frills. Thank you for brightening. my day, and bringing me joy, and great recipes."" You, that is so sweet, Myrna. Thank you for sharing. those kind words with me, and y'all mean a lot to me too. Y'all all meant a lot to meet. when the pandemic started, so it goes both ways, Myrna, and this pie just sounds incredible. And you start off with. one pre-baked pie crust. Now we are just using a frozen pie crust, because, you know, we want. this to be easy, don't we? So we're going that route. And Myrna says to use one. and a half to two quarts of fresh strawberries. that have been deflowered, washed and deflowered. So in the pot they go, and I want to make sure I follow her instructions perfectly. She said cook strawberries,. sugar, corn starch, and water on the stove,. stirring constantly until the mixture. thickens and turns clear, because it's going to be cloudy. when you first get going. All right, so I am going to mix our corn starch with our flour. That makes me feel a little bit better, because I don't want it lumping. Teresa, she really tests my skills. She gives me some big molds. to work with. (laughing) - [Teresa] Got you on your toes. - I'm telling you what, well,. I'm on my toes right now. So anyway, I would recommend. mixing your cooked sugar and your corn starch together. Just pour that over our strawberries, and we are gonna add a. fourth of a cup of water. So the original recipe called. for three-fourths a cup of sugar, but Myrna says over the years, they've bumped it up to a full cup, so that's what I'm doing too. So it was a nine inch pie. crust, one and a half quarts, one and a half to two quarts. of fresh strawberries, rinsed and deflowered, a. fourth of a cup of corn starch, and a fourth of a cup of water. So we're just going to cook. these until they run clear, stirring them the whole time, and we've got one more step. to do with our pie crust, which really sounds so good, Myrna. This is where the difference. is on any other strawberry pies I've seen, and we are going to coat four ounces of cream cheese. Myrna suggests soften it. a little bit with a couple of drops of milk, so that's what I did, and I put it in the microwave. for like, six seconds. So we're just going to spread this on the bottom, and up the. sides of our pie crust. And you'll want to let. your pie crust be cold. You don't want to spread your. cream cheese on a hot crust, because it would melt it. This is going to be delicious. You know who you used to. make good strawberry pies? I don't know if y'all remember this back in the late sixties, early. seventies, Shoney's Big Boy. Do y'all remember that? - [Teresa] Loved it. - I know it. They made a chocolate fudge. cake, and a strawberry, a mile high strawberry pie. - [Teresa] They had the. best breakfast buffet. - Oh, they did. They had a breakfast buffet back then. We never went in, we. just always, you know, went and got us stuff. - [Eddie] I don't think. I ever ate at Shoney's. - Are you kidding, Eddie? - [Eddie] Are they still around? - Are Shoney's still around, Teresa? - [Teresa] You know, I don't know. - But he was a chubby little. boy, and he had like a- - [Teresa] Checkered? - [Paula] Yeah, and he had a dip. His hair made a dip. like an ice cream cone. Okay. - [Teresa] There are still some Shoney's, but we do not have one. - [Paula] Oh, wow. - [Teresa] Big Boy was his name. - [Paula] Big Boy? - [Teresa] Mm-hmm. - Well, he was a big boy. Okay. Myrna, I might use a little. bit more cream cheese, because you know, I don't. like to skimp on (giggles) any of my condiments, but that did nicely. All right, so we're gonna. step over here to the stove. We are gonna cook our- - [Teresa] Put that in the refrigerator because it needs to- - Oh, okay. - [Teresa] Because that's. gonna need to chill. - Okay, well, you put. that in the refrigerator, and I'm gonna start. cooking these strawberries. - [Teresa] Perfect. - Okay, y'all. (spatula tapping) When Myrna says to keep it,. cook it until it becomes clear, it's not going to be like glass clear, but it has a murky look. until your corn starch and your sugar melt, so this. is what it's gonna look like, and it took maybe, gosh, it. probably took 10 minutes, and five of that was, you know, getting the strawberries hot. - [Eddie] It smells so good. - Doesn't it smell delicious? So I'm going to put these. in the refrigerator, and let them cool, and then we're going to pour them over our cream cheese lined pie crust, and then we're going to. whip up some heavy cream, and sweeten it to go on. top of this beautiful pie. Thank you, Myrna. All right, it's time for us to put our strawberry pie together. Oh, and I tasted this, and it is. yummy, y'all, perfectly yummy. Oops. Look at that. Now, Theresa is measuring us out a cup of heavy cream, and we're. going to sweeten that with a fourth of a cup. Oh my gracious. (giggles) This tastes so good, y'all. Mm, mm, mm. Mm. (giggles) So good. So, so, so, so, so good. Myrna, Myrna, Myrna. Mm. My only question, Myrna, is. did I cook it long enough? I hope I did. I hope I cooked it long enough. All right. So now we're gonna sweeten our whipped cream, and Theresa put us a. metal bowl in the freezer, so it's nice and cold. (beater whirring and scraping) Okay. Here we go with our thirty legged beater. (beater whirring and scraping) Now, this is just a personal preference. I just use a fourth of. a cup of white sugar. (beater whirring and scraping) Okey dokey. There we go. Myrna, Myrna, Myrna. Look at your pie, girl. Mm. Like I said, Myrna, I just hope that I, that I cooked the strawberries long enough to get thick. enough so it'll slice. Now let's see am I gonna. spread that to the edge, or do you want to do it like this so I can see those beautiful strawberries? I think I'll do it just like that. So you don't have to guess. at what kind of pie this is. There you go. Looks beautiful. You almost have to do his. part with your finger, to get the pretty little. swirls that you want. (giggling) That sounds like a good excuse for me. (laughing) So Myrna, thank you so much. This is actually going to. be our dessert for supper. I know it's delicious, because. the insides are incredible, and after putting that on our cream cheese that we lined our pie shell with, oh, thank you, girl. I appreciate you sharing so much. So love and best dishes, y'all. Have you some strawberry pie.";['postres']
sCAERJEaIhM.json;"- 12 days of Christmas cookies, y'all. I called, and y'all answered. I just love, love, love seeing. all my friends out there, what their favorite Christmas cookie is. And I got the sweetest. letter from Anne Elson. And Anne is from Ohio. And she said, ""Paula, first off I just wanna say I absolutely adore you as did my mother that passed away in 2008 when I was only 33 years old."" And that is so young, Anne. I was 23 when I lost. my mother and he said - I don't care how old you are,. it's just hard to say goodbye to your mother and your father. ""So in 2007 I went to visit my brother in Jacksonville and. then we went to Savannah for the weekend and mom. was not able to join him. So we went to your brother's restaurant, Uncle Bubba's and I. got your fried chicken. I took some of it back. to the condo, froze it, flew it home with me in my checked bag and by the time I arrived. back in Ohio, it had thawed. We reheat, we reheated it,. and mom was in hog heaven. Laugh out loud. I have enclosed my. favorite Christmas cookie and we would love to see. you make it on your channel. God bless, much love, Anne Elson."" And Anne, much love back to you. I can't tell you how it makes me feel when I get letters like yours. So, thank you. Thank you for your love and your support and reminding. me of my Uncle Bubba. My brother, Uncle. Bubba's was, it was good. It was good. So Anne has sent us pecan. tarts and they sound wonderful. We make something similar but not really. A little miniature pecan muffin. But I have not made one. like this one, Anne. So here we go. It makes 12 muffins. And I first thought that maybe you were making. miniature, putting 'em in a miniature, but you're not. You're, you have told me. to use a regular muffin tin which I appreciate that so much. So, alright, I'm gonna need,. we will need my beaters. - [Theresa] Sorry. - That's all right, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. - [Theresa] I forgot to. put the beater back out - So, you're not perfect after all? - [Theresa] No, far from. - I thought she was perfect, y'all. - [Theresa] Please. - You're perfect enough for us, Theresa. - [Theresa] Thank you. - Okay, so I've got three. ounces of cream cheese, of that brown sugar. So let's see if she gives. us any special instructions. Make the crust. - [Theresa] And the crust. is actually the butter. - Uh huh, includes cream. cheese, butter, flour, and salt. - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - So, using a cookie scoop, scoop out a ball of dough. into 12 muffin tins. I will do it. All right, so third of a, yeah, three ounces of cream. cheese, which would be, uh - Is it half? No, it's like, anyway, your cream cheese, it comes, you have an eight ounce, but. you can buy it in a three ounce - [Theresa] But they don't. sell three ounce anymore. - No! - [Theresa] They don't,. and, but they do tell you on the eight ounce package, the ounces, so you can measure your three and cut it. - I didn't realize,. cause see I never bought that to start with, cause I use a lot of cream cheese in this house. So this, this is gonna be our crust and I'm gonna add a little salt, and then I'm gonna add my flour, and just cream that all together. Now Anne doesn't say to. use a, Anne doesn't say whether we are supposed to. grease our muffin tins or not. So there's a lot of butter in here. So I'm assuming, and you. know what ""assume"" is but I'm assuming cause of all the butter in the crust that you. might not have to worry about it's sticking, but I. may just for the fun of it, give it a quick spray. All right, she, I think she said put a table spoon with a cookie scoop. Scoop out a ball of dough. Now where is my cookie scoop? I know it's around here somewhere. I think this might be it. I'm gonna give that a little. spray so that it won't stick. All right. After we get these filled, then I'm gonna come back. and spread them out. You know, like a pie. crust down on the bottom and up the sides. Okay Eddie, I've got 12 of them filled. Now what I need for you. to help me with is show me which ones look short to you. Definitely that one, yes. Which other one? Maybe that very first one I did. Because I was definitely guessing. What you think, Ed? - [Eddie] Yeah, that front one. - Which one? - [Eddie] That front one. - The very first one? - [Eddie] Yeah. - Okay, that looks pretty,. pretty even, doesn't it? Okay, Ms. Theresa - [Theresa] Yes ma'am? - There's your dirty bowl. Oh no, I'll use that. I can use it for the filling. cause it does not matter, cause it's all going. down in the same place. All right, so I'm gonna,. I'm gonna spray my hands so hopefully the dough will stick. to me instead of the pan. So Anne just says to press 'em out, we wanna make sure you don't. have any holes at the bottom. And course we're not gonna have. a tremendous amount of crust but coming up the sides, but. I think it'll be a penny. So that's the way we. are gonna handle that. And I think we're on our way to a winner. Not ""W-I-N-T-E-R"", but ""W-I-N-N-E-R"" And I had a hard time getting. the, the pie crust even I think cause some are kind of thin. You know what, I'm gonna. be making these again but you know what girl? I am gonna increase my. pie dough, my pie crust with a little bit more ingredients. So if I, if I mess up too. bad, I'll have some extra. But these look wonderful. Now I've got 'em on the bottom and up the sides the best I could. So now Anne says to put. your pecans on the bottom. And this is usually the way. I do my regular pecan pies. I like to put my nuts down on the pastry and then pour my liquid, the filling part on top of it so it just works out good. And I thought I saw, oh no, it's a nut. I thought I saw a piece. of shell, but I didn't. All right, now let's see. We start out with how many nuts? One cup of chopped pecans. And was this a cup,. Teresa? Did you measure? - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - Okay, so I don't know how many I might can get a little heavier. on my nuts, which is great. So I'll go back and use these. till I don't have a nut left. Where? Where am I shy, Eddie? Where? - [Eddie] That one. - This one? - [Eddie] The middle. - The middle one? - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. - Okay. Okay. I don't want anybody to not. have the right amount of nuts. This one looks short to me, right there. So I'm gonna steal, you. know, I'm going to borrow I'm going to borrow a. little nuts from the others. All right. So it's time to make our. filling and it too is simple. And Anne tells us not to beat. this with an electric mixer but to do it by hand. And that's two eggs. And I think that's a cup of brown sugar. Let me check. - [Theresa] I think its on the bottom. - Yeah. Cup of brown sugar. And you can use light or dark. Dark brown sugar will just give. you a little darker muffin. And now with the butter. I just love pecan pie and. I don't make 'em very often because I want to eat the. whole, you know, pie by myself. - [Eddie] I tell you what, the one, the pecan pie that you serve. at Creek House is so good. - Isn't it delicious? - [Eddie] Yes. - Delicious, delicious. - [Eddie] I didn't discover. that until too late. - Have they quit serving that? Did they take that opportunity? - [Eddie] Oh no, no, no, they still - Oh, you're too full. Is that right? - [Eddie] Well, no, I mean you've been open three years. and I've just discovered it. - Oh! Oh, you said it was too late. I didn't know what you were talking about. Okay, I'm gonna divide this equally. Where's my little scoop? I'm gonna try to do this perfectly even. This recipe is very, very easy and the only thing is. that what takes me so long is trying to get everything. just perfect as far as, as far as dividing the. muffins perfectly even. But this is gonna help, by using my butter scooper. for cookie scooper. And I got it! And I hope I. got 'em pretty much even. And I hope I do not disappoint. Don't wanna disappoint you with your recipe cause. it looks too wonderful. - How long does it say to put it in there? - 350 for 20 minutes, Theresa. And I so enjoyed reading. your sweet email to me.

Not only did I have a sweet,. sweet letter full of love, I got a sweet, sweet recipe. that Anne sent in along with her email and their pecan. tarts and the crust y'all. Y'all remember at the very start Our crust is flour, cream cheese, Can't remember now. Butter? Butter, - [Theresa] Little bit of butter. - Cream cheese. - [Theresa] It's right. there in front of you. - Sure is. One three-ounce package of cream cheese, a stick of butter cup of flour and a dash of salt. My own pecan pie, I. didn't eat the whole pie. I don't make many pecan pies and because I just want to. eat the whole thing. So this is just a perfect satisfier. And I do love a cream cheese crust. Mm mm! So thank you so much, huh? I just love what y'all send to me. I appreciate it. The tarts are delicious. Can you imagine with a scoop of ice cream? Just a little scoop.";['postres']

sLuBG5An2X0.json;hey y'all it's me Paula now with all this thing that's going on in the country the quarantine I told y'all that I was gonna be coming in and just doing little cooking shows to try to help Entertain You a little bit and us just share ideas I'd love for y'all to send in your ideas to me and tell me what you'd like to see me prepare right now I'm trying to do things y'all because we're not out going to the grocery store every day I'm trying to come up with some things that you would have in your home without going to the store so a little while ago I made us a peach cobbler that the lady and Sons peach cobbler and look how beautiful look how beautiful that is and I have to tell you I've made a lot of cobblers over the years but this one is the easiest of all converse to me I love that corner with all the crusty on it so I'm gonna show y'all just how we make this and it's easy as pie it's easy as cobbler about that all right so the number one thing that is the most important is that you use self-rising flour if you don't have self-rising flour add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt and that will produce self-rising so remember your baking powder and your salt and you'll have self-rising flour so the recipe calls for one and a half cups of self-rising flour and I love my measuring cups I think we have these at the store these beautiful measuring cups and I like - they're so good for dry ingredients and you want to take the back part of your knife and you want to just level that off so we know without a doubt that's a cup all right a cup and a half of flour is that no that's the third right why didn't I think of that I'm not as smart as you Teresa all right not kind of hit it like that so it'll get down in there and there we go a cop and a half self rising flour and this is a little something I do just to make me feel better because I remember one time getting a bag of flour that said self rising and it was not it was not somehow plain flour had gotten in that bag so just to make myself feel better I'll just put about that much baking powder in so this is that it was part of teaspoons okay because I know without a shadow of a doubt that this is self rising flour all right now we're gonna do a cup and a half of sugar I'll let them know I'm not crazy when it's great Teresa said let y'all know I'm not crazy I'm sorry I can't do that to yourself I do talk to myself but I ain't starting answering me yet maybe I have on a couple of occasions all right so here we go a cup and a half of self-rising flour a cup and a half of sugar and you want to just take a wire whisk and it's almost like does the same job as a sifter you want to get that mixed up real good make sure that's very well incorporated so called a PD yeah baking powder doesn't hurt if you I mean it does oh no no that's what I would give it some more fluff all right I'm gonna dish in the oven and let that butter melt that's the number one ingredient in this compliment is a stick of melted butter all right cup and a half of sugar cup and a half of flour one cup of milk and you want to kind of add it slow so it won't lump so bad so just start with that little whale in the center and Theresa you want let's not keep mixing that up for me and then I'm gonna move on to the peaches because this is gonna take me a minute it's wonderful when we have fresh peaches available but what month is this March it's not peach season so at the lady and Sons we use canned peaches because we know every time that's gonna produce a consistent dish I also love using frozen peaches and these peaches will see it come stuff it's a pound it's a pound of peaches excuse me the placement of the camera she lays all right so these peaches are not sweet at all so we're gonna have to make a syrup for these peaches and to do that I'm gonna add 1 cup of sugar or maybe 3/4 a cup yeah I'll do about 3/4 of a cup and I'm gonna do 1 cup of water why did I do with my measuring cup oh thank you so one cup early banners of water and now we're gonna put this on the stove and we are gonna cook that for a little while we want to make sure that our sugar is totally dissolved so we'll let that come to a ball and I tell you frozen peaches if you sweeten them just right they're almost as good as fresh not quite but almost I've got a peach tree out in our yard I think I don't did you know that ain't kicking you didn't know well I've got a peach tree out there and it's called donut peaches and the peaches are flat and it looks like a donut because the stem you know kind of goes in like it's a hole and they're white the meat is bright white those aren't the best are they hard to grow oh they are Bulldogs appeal yes you have to drop those important waters they are named monkey oh they're horrible but they taste something and they're the color of peyer's looks just like a pear all right so this is starting to get by we've got our stick of butter melting in our dish see how simple this is I mean it's so easy I don't have anything to do y'all want some kombu oh you didn't need at all that's watching Herkimer well I gave her a homemade blueberry muffin a while ago and I made the big ones oh you'll find the recipe for that in the new baking cookbook Halloween southern baking that blueberry recipe in that book y'all you'll never wanna make another blueberry muffin as long as you leave yeah all right so let's see what else I can talk about oh yes I want to talk about the triplets but I also want to remind people that they can go to Amazon I'm not using the air fryer today but you can go to Amazon and see the biggest air fryer that's available out there anywhere so that that's my air fryer Bobby did FaceTime cloud and bobbing clamps they did FaceTime with me and they are quarantined so tight in their house y'all because these little babies only lift in their mother's tummy about well 26 weeks no no I don't think they lived in there six months no oh my boobs check 4/24 they had it so said it's what was great at clothes right at six six months getting close to but they had to finish baking you might say in that incubator outside their mother's womb so which started them off with lung disease heart their heart you know they will hold it a hole in their heart you know but all these things are correcting itself and that amazing yes it's it there they take my breath away they are amazing but their care klaudia and bobbies care of these babies has been spot on it's been spot on and they're flourishing but but cause they started out so yes they they have had good role models but with them starting out so vulnerable they are extra extra safe with their most precious babies so I wish I could what did they go to even see them actually we're probably gonna start seeing them a lot on Instagram looking for the Deen brothers Instagram good in the next week or so oh good good good good it will be a net one I know that claudia has a wonderful Facebook page or Instagram I don't know what it is because I'm not totally computer literate I don't know all the tricks of the trade I know how to play Wizard of Oz okay but anyway she's an interesting girl to kind of follow she's a triathlete and like I said she wears me out just know was she a medium she amazed me because she was this beautiful young woman that was raised in Venezuela and raised in not a life like we were raised in you know and for her to come in so she was come on to us she probably was coming in to a different language oh yeah she she went to school here and she the language is sometimes yes I think they I think they had a cook a housekeeper and a nanny from what I gather so cloudy it was not raised like Bobbie and Jenny you know we didn't we didn't have all that but she stepped up to the plate in the most unselfish manner it didn't matter what she had to go through as long as her babies well where they were supposed to be that was all that mattered to she and Bobby and you know it just fabulous yes I'm just in awe all right so go our sugar has totally melted so we got our syrup and let's see yeah this is melted I don't like doing blood shot Sadie if I lean in that up and do you not gonna get a butt shot oh are you you can turn towards [Music] okay infection yes ma'am oh it's like brown butter all right so we're gonna take our batter and we're just gonna pour it on top of that butter now the first and most important thing in this recipe is like I told you when we started self-rising flour the next important thing is do not stir this do not stir do not stir all right because that batter is gonna come up over these peaches so I'm gonna take a female spoon and first just dig out the peaches and spread them evenly with that butter so it's gonna go where's the noise that's our butter that's that batter hitting that hot pan all right now the next step is to ladle this juice now I like a lot of I like a lot of juice in my cobbler I actually probably didn't have a full cup of water when I did that one but I'm gonna put all this juice and I'm putting it on as lightly as I can not to disturb that batter mmm-hmm if you're using canned peaches you want to make sure that you use all the juice that's in the canyon huh you just yes I'm twice peaches and you just pour them over that batter and leg into your peaches on top I don't like to just dump it I like so just cling peaches you're just talking yeah clean - yes yes yes and and then pour the sauce over like you just yes so just drain them and right right you can you can add sugar water if you'd like more juice but you see it works out pretty good oops now if the lady and sons and Paula Deen's family kitchen we sprinkle it with a little cinnamon in it show do make it good Kerry bought me this cinnamon it's that good good time all right so oh who knew there were so many cinnamon I know all right now I've got my oven on 350 degrees and I'm gonna set my timer to about 30 minutes and to find this recipe y'all if you didn't have a pen and didn't jot it down you can go to www.hsn.com what else did I want to say to them going shine I hope y'all are enjoying this

SvJfz8QsPG4.json;- Hey all, is Jamie Dean and I'm in mama's kitchen. And it's almost Thanksgiving. So Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday of the year by the way, because Scottish football and there's lots of family, and there's lots of food. I've got family all. through the house today, my great greats here,. my cousin Carl is here. Everybody's coming together around the table this time of year, especially here at momma's house. It is so good, and one of the staples that we have every year is a pumpkin pie. So that's what we're. gonna do for you today. So if you don't have anything else to do, you go buy yourself and all your things that you need, make yourself a pie dough. Or you just go buy one from the freezer, poke it and cook it, which is what I do. But there are lots of beautiful ways that you could dress up a pie. If you wanna go pinch and fold, and if you wanna make your own, please do. We're so busy around here I barely have time to. go to the grocery store to buy the frozen one, to get my pie in the oven. So that's what I've done today, we've got our pie crust. has been pre-baked off and it's ready to go. And here is the filling, this is a really easy recipe. I always say that, but for the most part, our recipes that we do. here are fairly easy 'cause everybody is busy. We got eight-ounce package. of cream cheese here and I'm just gonna soften up with my hand mixer a little bit (blender whirring) just to get it a little mix-ey. (blender whirring) Okay, just real quick lightly. Into this we gonna add our pumpkin, get me a good tool to work with here. What we have here is two cups of mashed canned pumpkin. So we're gonna add our pumpkin into our cream cheese. This is good enough for. me to eat just this way, I love cream cheese and pumpkin. We're gonna whip this together. (blender whirring) Okay y'all, I'm gonna turn this back down. Now to this am gonna add our sugar, this is 1 cup of granulated sugar. (blender whirring) We also gonna beat in a little bit of salt. This is about a good pinch, a little bit of pepper got in there too. That's about a quarter. of a teaspoon of salt. And we're also gonna mix in, follow me here now, I got three eggs, one whole egg and then two egg yolks. Okay, so three yolks, one whole egg, two egg yolks. (blender whirring) We're also gonna add one. cup of half and half. (blender whirring) we have a quarter of a. cup of melted butter. (blender whirring) I'm gon mix this up before. we put our spices in. (blender whirring) All right, I've got all. this stuff combined, so let's add some of our flavors in here. This is a half of a. teaspoon of ground ginger. This is, no I'm sorry, that's a quarter of a teaspoon of ginger. This is a half a teaspoon. of our fresh cinnamon, and then we're gonna add. one teaspoon of vanilla. Alright, one more time around. the band with the mixer. (blender whirring) All right, now we're gonna pour this carefully into, how do I release this? We're gon be be all right, let me do this It can drip in there. We're gonna pour this into our pie flan. And I've got some filling left over, you know what I might do? Is take this extra that I have and put it in a little muffin tin, and do some little pumpkin muffins and that sound good. Ooh, I just tasted that and even though it's got raw eggs in it, it is 1000% delicious. I got my oven on 350, this is gonna bake for about 50 minutes. And soon I'm gonna be eating pumpkin pie, this is amazing. Y'all stick around. Mmmhh. All right Joe, our pie is out of the oven. You know, I wound up I had so much Pie filling leftover that Theresa and I put. an extra pie in the oven. Extra pie, how awesome is that? Now all we have to do is wait patiently for this to cool. Probably only about 15. or 20 minutes, I guess. We just sit here and. wait for this to cool. Let me grab a fork and let's just see what's. happening down in here, I ain't waiting 15 minutes. Maybe nobody won't notice.. (giggles) Oh, I'm gonna burn my. face off again I can tell. - [Theresa] Looks good.. - [Jamie] I know it. Should I try to cut a piece?. - [Theresa] Nah. - ohh all right, It is so hot y'all. Every time. Mmmmh. - [Theresa] And yet you go in again. - [Jamie] Gosh, it's like a pumpkin fluff. - [Theresa] Add some whipped cream? - The half and half with a pumpkin, the spices y'all. I could probably almost cut this but I'm gonna let it cool or just let me, here's a knife. I hate to leave it looking so ugly. Look and instead of making a cut where only one piece was ugly, I cut it where two. pieces are gonna be ugly. Not really thinking straight when I got pumpkin on the brain well. - [Theresa] We do recommend that you let it cool. - [Jamie] You are gonna. have to let this cool. But when you're cooking food in the house, I always say, if you ain't. selling it, who cares? This pie is fantastic. Although I did cut it too soon, it tastes delicious. You'll be thankful that. you have this pumpkin pie at your table this Thanksgiving. Appreciate y'all tuning in, I'll see you all around the kitchen.;['postres']
t6_gYE6IP4k.json;"- Hey y'all, hey friends. Have we come up for a. new name for this show? No, we hadn't. Didn't we ask people to submit a name? - [Woman] Those videos. probably haven't come out yet. - So we're asking, we're not going, we're going to quit calling. this the Quarantine Videos because I feel like we're on. the backend of our quarantine, and anyway, after the quarantine, I'm still going to be doing these. But I guess right now they are the Quarantine cooking videos. Until we come up with a better name, and I'm gonna need y'all's help. I'm so excited to share this. recipe with y'all today. My grandmother Hiers's butternut cake. And I have never seen this cake anywhere except in my grandmother Hiers's kitchen. And it's delicious, it turns out to be a bright yellow. This is the vanilla. butter and nut flavoring, and it kind of turns. everything a bright yellow. And I could not find any. in the grocery store. So Eddie ordered this off the website. I don't know which one. Can you tell me, Eddie? - [Eddie] I just got it off of Amazon. - Amazon, okay. 'Cause it's hard, hard to find. Ooo, I wish y'all could smell it. Have you smelled it, Eddie? Smells so yummy, I'd love to drink it, but you know it would taste like poo. - [Eddie] No, I don't think that. When I think of butternut I'm. thinking butternut squash. What is the meaning? Since it's kind of an old-timey. - It's a combination of vanilla flavoring, vanilla extract, a butter extract, and a nut extract. It's all three of them together. Maybe if I change glasses. These are for the sun. These are my shades, 'cause the bright light, I may shut those in a minute. Contains water, propylene glycol. That sounds like that stuff that puts you to sleep, doesn't it? Natural and artificial flavors, xanthum gum, FD&C yellow number five, FD&C red number 40, and sodium... Benzate. (laughs) Anyway, it's good y'all. I don't know all those terms, all those technical terms. I do hope that y'all will make this cake and enjoy it. It brings back a lot of memories for me. Let me tell y'all the story behind this. I'm starting with one cup of Crisco. I was doing one of my shows and my Aunt Beth Hiers, who was married to my Uncle Bob, she saw the show where. I said I didn't know what I had done with grandma's recipe, I hadn't been able to find it. She wrote me the sweetest card. She wrote me a get well. card about my eyes. She said, ""Saw your show when. you talked about grandma Hiers and her yellow cake. I'm sending the recipe. It's always been one of our favorites. Love, Aunt Beth."" I appreciate that so much, Beth. In fact, I need to just. sit down and talk with you and make sure I have gotten. all of grandma Hire's recipes, because with y'all just. living around the corner from each other down there in Winterhaven, you were able to keep track. on what she was doing. I think you so much, my dear Aunt Beth. We're gonna start with one cup of Crisco and two cups of flour, I mean two cups of sugar. And you know what, they told me that if you plug this in, that it works a lot better. (laughs) But that may be just a rumor. We'll see. I got sinus issues this morning, y'all. It used to be that all. your cakes and cookies, everything was made with, I don't mean to push this brand, but it was made with Crisco. Your biscuits, yeah, a solid shortening. But if you were real lucky, when you were making your. pie crust and your biscuits, you had your hand on some lard. 'Cause it makes the. flakiest, lightest biscuits you've ever put in your mouth. I'm just gonna cream this up real good. This'll actually be lapsed time. (mixer whirring) All right, now we're gonna add four eggs, and my grandmother tells me to beat them before I add them in, but I'm not going to do that. I'm just gonna drop them in one at a time. I don't think it'll have. a great deal of difference in the way our cake turns out. I can see those eggs. already making it yellow. Okay, last egg. (mixer whirring) All right, I wanna make sure. I scrape the sides down. So it'll all get mixed up really well. You don't want to over beat a cake, and you don't want to under beat it. Have to be kind of careful. My next step is to add two. cups of self-rising flour. I found in a lot of grandma's cakes she used self-rising flour, and a cup of milk. I'm gonna alternate flour to milk, and you wanna start with. flour and end with flour. I do not know why, I'm not a scientist. But your cake is so much. smoother and creamier by adding the flour last. We're gonna start with the flour. (mixer whirring) And remember you'll. wanna take your spatula scrape the sides down, so it'll all get incorporated. You'll just have to watch your milk and your flour so that you. just have enough flour left for that to be the last addition. - [Woman] I never knew that about flour. I didn't know that about flour. - You didn't? Didn't know what? - [Woman] That flour be last. - Oh yeah, yeah. Most recipes will share that. information with you, Teresa. In case it doesn't... - [Teresa] Tip of the day. - If it tells you to. alternate wet with dry, make sure that your dry is the last. I think my milk's gonna. last longer than my flour, so I just adjust that by. pouring a little bit more flour. Little bit more milk in there. If I feel like I'm getting off with it. I alternated the milk with the flour. Last thing to go in is the flour. I had it worked out pretty good. It wasn't too, too bad. That last flour is gonna make it perfect. Thank you, grandmamma. I was so fortunate to have two wonderful sets of grandparents. And my two grandmothers could. not have been more different. I have a picture somewhere. here in this house of my two grandmothers, one was about 5'10, and the other one was like 4'10, 4'11. I just adore that picture of them. I said it was like a devil and an angel. - [Eddie] They were together. standing side by side? - Yes, they were standing side by side. I think I've even seen it hung down at one of the restaurants, I'm not sure. Grandmother Hiers, she was an angel. In fact, I remember my daddy telling me he had gotten sick and was. getting ready to have surgery, he said ""You know your grandmother Hiers is really an angel."" She was the finest Christian. woman I've ever met. Got to the fourth grade, and when I'd go stay with her and visit, we had to read the bible every night. She would read all those long words, and I would say ""I don't know. what that means, grandmamma."" And she would explain it. Now, fourth grade education, but she was so kind, and my grandma Paul, she was... - [Eddie] A little spicy? - Yeah, she was kind of spicy. And she worked like a dog, well, so did my grandma Hiers, grandma Paul, I think. both of my grandmothers were women of substance. I said ""That's what I. wanna be when I grow up. A woman of substance."" If I ever run up on that picture, I'll show you my two grandmammas. Now, I'm fixing to add one tablespoon of that incredible, incredible flavoring. Doing this reminds me of that. day I was on the Oprah show, and I was making grandma. Paul's sour cream pound cake, and I was using one of. these little rami cans to something in and I dropped it. And the mixer was just. like on number five, it was going to beat the band. - [Teresa] And what'd you do? - I ran. I thought somebody's got to clean this up. And then I realized it was my job. After I had sprayed my children sitting there with new clothes on, I sprayed batter all over them and whoever else was sitting by them. It was a mess, it'd like. to scare me to death. That glass banging around. I said ""Oh, the glass is. gonna fly out and blind her. And the country's gonna hate me."" I'm seeming like, Aunt Beth, that I remember grandmamma. putting nuts in her cake part, but apparently she did not. It's in the icing. The icing is like a. sour, cream cheese icing, but with the flavoring. Okay, so here we go. Normally, I would cut out. parchment paper or wax paper, then I'd sit it on it and cut it out, so I'd have a piece of. paper to go in the bottom where it wouldn't stick. But I love this... release stuff. It comes in all kind of brands. Now they've got it where. they put flour in it. We grease our pans and then flour it, then put our stuff in. But since they've come out with. a baking release with flour, I just go straight to the pan. And I make sure I get. it really, really good. 'Cause there's nothing worse. There's nothing worse than baking a cake and then it don't wanna. come out of the pan. I did a show the other day. It didn't wanna come out of the pan. But I forced it to come out and play. And it looked awful. But it ate good. Didn't it ate good? Didn't it eat good? (dogs barking) We're about out of this. That's gonna be a dead man. Okay, so here we go. Hey Mikey. - [Mikey] Hey. - All right, so this is the. way I like my cake layers to be perfectly even. This is the way I do it to make sure I get it perfectly even. I use my measuring spoon. You hungry, Mikey? I think I hear the cupcakes being... Sought out. You're being very quiet. I think I'm gonna go down. to the half a cup now. 'Cause we're getting lower. and lower on our cake batter. You don't wanna know what. I'm making, Eddie, Michael? You don't wanna know what I'm making? - [Mikey] A cake. - You are so smart. - [Mikey] Why do they call it batter, they should call it gooder. - My husband is a goofball, y'all. He just said ""Why do they call it batter, it should've been called gooder."" All right, I'm gonna come down. to another smaller size now, because we're getting. down to the very end. I think it's gonna just. work out kind of perfect. We're gonna have to work to get that last fourth of a cup out of there. But guess what. It worked out perfect. That's a little short, but not too much. Not enough to count. I'm gonna wash my hands real quick like. And then I'm gonna show y'all what I do. (woman whispering) Oh yeah, the oven's on. Oh no, it's not on. So we're gonna have to wait a minute. Grandmother says to bake this for about 30-35 minutes on 350, and Aunt Beth said you can. use three 8 or 9 inch pans, but I remember just about. all of my grandmother's cakes was three layers. So this is what I like. to do with my cakes. I don't like those. bubbles when you cut it. You got those bubbles in the middle of it. That is so good. You can see, I don't know. if you can see, Eddie. I mean, I can see. If you get down there on it, when you drop them, see the bubbles coming up? - [Eddie] You've got every. one with earpieces in jumping out of their seat right now. - Oh, I didn't think about. the poor audio man's ears. - [Teresa] Do you do the. thing for like a Bundt cake. - I don't do it with a pound cake. Just layer cakes. Lots of air bubbles. Okay, so that's it. I'm gonna wait a minute for the oven to get to the proper temperature. And in 35 minutes,. we're gonna take it out, or maybe in 30, I don't know,. I'll just keep an eye on it. And then we're gonna let it cool, and then I'm gonna make that. wonderful, wonderful icing. Y'all, I'm so happy to be. sharing this recipe with y'all. If it hadn't been for Aunt Beth, I wouldn't be doing it. I thank you, my dear Aunt Beth. The recipe, grandma's. recipes, a lot of her recipes call for cream cheese to. make the cream cheese icing. But, I can't stand coming. up short on my frosting. So I always, rather than. just one eight ounce package, I use one and a half packages. I've got one stick of butter. And the powdered sugar,. it calls for one box of powdered sugar. But I'm gonna add probably that much more, because I just want to know. that I've got enough frosting, and I don't have to be stingy with it. I'm gonna beat our cream cheese. (mixer whirring) And our butter together, and all that needs to. be at room temperature so it will beat up easily. Just cream it together. Sometimes if I forget to take. my cream cheese or my butter out of the refrigerator, I will pop it in the microwave on defrost for just a minute,. maybe not even a minute. That works very, very well. What'd I say, Teresa, two. tablespoons of the butternut? - [Teresa] Yes ma'am. Watch out, 'cause it. turns your hand yellow. - I know (laughs). Wonder if it'll turn my mouth yellow. If I tell y'all ""No, I. have not had any cake."" And y'all accidentally see my tongue, you'd know I was telling a story. (mixer whirring) If y'all make this. recipe, you just determine right off the bat if you want to increase your ingredients for. the icing or frosting. - [Eddie] Is this the. color that you remember? - It's a little softer. The more powdered sugar we add,. the lighter it's gonna get. Yeah, but that's it. I'm getting flour everywhere. - [Eddie] Sugar. - Oh sugar, yes, not flour, it's sugar. I make a lot of carrot cakes, and that's from my. grandmamma Hiers's collection of cakes that she used to bake a lot. I'm like her, I like nuts in my icing. I think nuts make. everything so much better. But I will tell you this, if you put nuts in your icing, it just makes it harder to. get it smooth on your cake. If you don't wanna add it to it, you can just make this cake, you can make your icing and put it on, and then just pour your nuts on top of it if you want nuts. It just spreads so much easier if you don't put the nuts in. But I don't think I'm gonna be able to resist those nuts mixed in. I like those nuts in. between every cake layer. I think I mentioned something earlier about having your oven calibrated. You can see, I always. cook my cakes and cookies in my big convection oven. But I can't do it while I'm. filming, because it's so loud. Y'all wouldn't be able. to hear a thing we said. I have to use this oven. You can see there's a. hot spot in this oven. 'Cause see where this edge. I had these two on top, on the top rack pushed to the back to make room for that third pan. I definitely got to get these calibrated. Okay, we're about to get it. That looks like lemon. ice cream, doesn't it? I found some lemon ice cream the other day in our Publix here. - [Teresa] Did you really? - Yes, I have not seen. lemon ice cream in years. - [Teresa] Was it like a custard? - It's Bluebell, it's Bluebell, and go with me and get you some. It's in the freezer in the dining room. Go in there and try it and. tell me what you think. I was so excited. I told Aunt Peggy when. I was talking to her, 'cause she had asked me if I had ever seen lemon ice cream out there. And I had to tell her I had not. Not in years. Alrighty. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Yum yum. I know bakers, they use an off... An offsite, what am I trying to think of? - [Eddie] Spatula. - You know the knife that goes like this, and then it goes like that. It's an offset spatula, I guess. But anyway, I know that's what cake, professional cake makers. use to spread their icing, but I just can't get the. gist of that spatula. I'm putting down just. a little bit of icing so that hopefully my cake. won't move around on me. I just have to go around and check and see if I got it in the center, which I think I do. Do I nut it or do I not? I tell you, this is what I'm gonna do. - [Teresa] Put it on and. then put some nuts on top. - 'Cause see how easy that smooths. Just got to be careful. - [Teresa] Sorry, I'm. going to get the ice cream. (laughs) - Good. It actually looks like I'm frosting this cake with mustard, Eddie. Doesn't it? Can you imagine a mustard cake? I think it'll take more nuts this way. She's getting her ice cream. Now I'm gonna go get this other one that had kind of a burnt place on it. Let's see, I wanna make. sure that I put those on opposite sides. So now it looks pretty level. It's still kind of... Still kind of messed up a little bit. I remember one time I was. visiting Martha Stewart's place. I was making a cake. I said ""Martha, can I ask you a question?"" And she looked at me like, what is this crazy woman about to say? And she said ""Well, yeah."" And I said ""When you're. frosting your cake, do you start on the top or. the sides of your cake?"" She looked very relieved with my question. To keep my cake layers from slipping, I'm gonna add... Just three toothpicks. And you just have to warn your guest not to eat a toothpick. For the last layer, Teresa, I think I might. need some more nuts. Because it took a good bit when. you're sprinkling it on top. We got some more chopped,. or am I gonna have to... (woman muttering) Hmm? - [Teresa] Chopped extra. - Oh good, yay. Let's see, I need to find. the thick and the thin. - [Teresa] I should've known. she was gonna need more. - Thank ya, thank ya. If a recipe calls for nuts, I like lots of them. Which you can see where it would, where it would be easier. to spread without them. Now this is the way I do it. Start off by putting my frosting. on top close to the edge, and then I just bring it down. I let this part work for me. Okay friends, this is it. My grandma Hiers's butternut cake. Finished. I'm not gonna cut it, because if I cut it, I will just want to eat and eat and eat. But the inside of the. cake is the same color as this icing, because the butternut. vanilla nut butter flavoring turns it this color. Just take my word for it. It's delicious. It would make me very, very happy to know that I shared one. of my grandmother's recipes that maybe you're making out there. This is definitely love. and best dishes to you. Oh, my little grandma Hiers, she was 4'10. Little tiny thing. I don't know why I'm not just like her. Maybe I ate too many of her cakes. See you next show.";['postres']
TazTYIAaExU.json;"- Good morning. You know, I always love. when I hear from y'all. Well, I got a note in the. mail from Peter Mahagian? Do you think that? M A- - [Teresa] It almost look like. Michigan but there's extras- - It does, it looks like Michigan except its M A H I G I A N. Sorry, Peter if I. mutilated your last name. But listen to this, he said, ""Met you Paula, 14 years ago on a Paula Deen cruise."" So after 14 years, I'm. stealing his memory bank. So, thank you Peter for that. So, he sent me a recipe and he said, ""This is his nana's recipe. that comes over from Ireland."" So, took him 14 years to get it to me, but I finally got it Peter. and thank you so much. And this is a very, very,. very, very simple dish. In fact, if it called for melted butter I wouldn't even have to pull. out my little hand mixer, but since it does not. call for melted butter, (silverware rustling) I'm gon' mix it up with. my little hand mixer. (knife scrapping noises) Y'all know I'm gonna get. all the good off this paper. (Paula laughs) Look at that almost two teaspoons. (Paula laughs) All right. So, we've got half a cup of butter. (mixer hitting glass noises) And I'm just gonna give that a few twirls. (mixer buzzing noises) Okay. And then we've got three. fourths of a cup of molasses. So that sounds like an Irish. recipe. Doesn't it, Teresa? - [Teresa] It does. - Calling for molasses. - [Teresa] And it's. actually a cup of molasses. - Oh, it was a cup? I thought. it looked like three quarters. Thank you, thank you.. Molasses is very, very strong. I think it's even stronger. than our cane syrup, (Teresa hums in agreement) You know? Okay. - [Teresa] It tastes so good. - Yes. I'm gonna add a half a cup of sugar and I'm gon' add one egg. (egg bangs on table) So, gon' mix this up. (mixer hitting bowl) Looks like motor oil. Doesn't it Terese? - [Teresa] Very good motor oil. - [Paula] Yes. (mixer twirls off) Okay, so I want to stop and go around my bowl. My little rubber spatula. - [Teresa] That smells so good. - Okay, so he just says. stir, stir everything in. So we've got two cups. of all purpose flour, half a teaspoon of cinnamon, one teaspoon of soda, half a teaspoon of ginger, and a fourth of a. teaspoon of ground cloves. (bowls hitting each other) Okie-dok. So I think, I don't know if. we can retire that yet or not 'cause right now it looks thick, but this is gonna be a real thin batter. (running water) And we have to add one cup of hot and he specified in. capital letters the, ""HOT."" (spatula bangs against bowl) (running water) So this is very similar to one. of our damps cakes, isn't it? - [Teresa] It is. (running water) - And this water gets. pretty hot in my sink. Teresa had a cup poured. up and it cooled off 'cause we'd been talking and talking. (both laughing) I know y'all find that hard to believe. All right, now Peter said to- - [Teresa] Oh-oh. (mixer whirls) - That kinda got out of hand for a minute. So Peter said to just stir. in you're very hot water. So Ima' mix this up and. then from here on out we just gonna stir it, maybe. (mixer rattling against bowl) It depends on how it looks y'all. (Teresa laughs) Okay. You know what? This. reminds me of ginger bread. - [Teresa] I was thinking the same thing. - [Paula] Smells like ginger bread. - [Teresa] But I guess. when you add the water, it's what makes cakey. - Yeah. And just the one egg. Okay. He doesn't say whether to stir it fast or slow or all at once or anything. So I'm gon' go a little slower. And he did not say y'all,. anything about an icing on this but he calls it a cake. (water splattering noise) I think I am gon' turn on my mixer. One more time. (mixer rumbling) Yeah, 'cause I wanna make sure it's all incorporated very, very well. And you can see the. batter is very, very thin. (mixer rattles against bowl) You know Teresa I almost think, maybe a cinnamon glaze on it? - [Teresa] Uhhh... - Maybe kind of like a cinnamon roll. - [Teresa] Yum, that sorta thing so. Well, you know, we always have a confectioner's sugar. - [Paula] I know. (Paula laughs) - [Teresa] On hand. - There's a few things. we don't run out of. - [Teresa] At all. - Butter, mayonnaise,. confectioner's sugar, white sugar and flour. (running water noises) - [Teresa] We usually have sour cream. - [Paula] Oh, always got sour cream too. (non-stick spray spraying) All right now Peter tells us to bake this in a glass. - [Teresa] Now he tells us. a nine by nine but you know- - Nine by nine, this is. an eight by eight, right? - [Teresa] And that's because we struggle with the fact that we haven't unpacked a nine by nine yet, so. - [Paula] It's in storage, our. nine by nine is in storage. All right so it'll take a. little bit longer probably, than what Peter has recommended cooking. - [Teresa] It's gon' be thicker? - The cooking time yeah,. it's gon' be fatter. Okay, so there we go. He tells us to bake this in a preheated 350 degree. oven for 35 to 40 minutes. So I'm gonna set our timer. on, maybe 45 minutes. (water running) Of course you know I'll. peak at it before then but I think that's maybe. what it'll take for ours. Okay, so see, y'all in 45. Our little cake is ready,. the recipe from Ireland. So, I did have to cook it a little longer, than was recommended. because our pan was smaller but that looks delicious - [Teresa] And it smells fabulous. - Smells so good. Do y'all smell it? (Paula laughs) No, you don't smell it. I know you can't, but I'm. not gon' try to cut it right now 'cause it's too hot. So we'll come back in a. minute after it's cooled and we'll taste it and. decide what whip cream, fresh whipped sweetened cream or a glaze or maybe even a frosting or maybe just naked like. the recipe was given to us. Your nana's- What'd she call it? Molasses cake. I keep wanting to call it, a gingerbread cake, is cooled off enough so, (knife hitting glass) Teresa and I, sorry about. you not being here Eddie but we'll save you a piece. So Teresa, ooh, gosh that cuts good. - [Teresa] Look how moist it is. - Uh-huh, it is, it's so moist. Wow. So let's talk about whether. we wanna icing for this. (Paula laughs in delight) Oh my gosh! (silverware rattles) Teresa. - [Teresa] That's always a good sign. - There's your fork girl, fork it. Mm mm mm! It is so moist. Look how moist. I don't know- (silverware scratching pan) - [Teresa] I think I'm just. about to dig in with my fingers. - I got a great big mouthful. - [Teresa] Oh my God. - I know! - [Teresa] Those were. great flavors together. - Uh-huh! - [Teresa] See, I think. you've put whipped cream on it and it would be fine, I don't- - That's what I think too. - (Teresa) I don't. think you'd would wanna- - Just a dollop of a. frozen whipped topping, but I would use a fresh. sweetened whipped cream on top. - [Teresa] Only 'cause anything else might take away from the- - That's what I'm thinking. - [Teresa] Flavors. - That's what I'm thinking - [Teresa] That is the bomb! - It is! - [Teresa] I'll be making that. and taking that to friends. - Mm mm mm! Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater. You made me a molasses eater. (Paula laughs) I'm a poet and don't know it y'all. (Paula laughs) Delicious Peter. I hope you have many fun. memories of your nana and thank you so much for choosing to share it. with me, darling, thank you. Love and best dishes.";['postres']

TGqVC8E5s_E.json;"- Hey, my friends, we're back in the kitchen here. today in Savannah, Georgia. I'm Paula Dean, and I. hope that you have enjoyed my little cooking shows on YouTube. Since the quarantine started, I wanted to find a way to just come in and spend a few minutes with y'all, and hopefully forget. all about the problems just for a short while. So, I was saying earlier, we're gonna have to change the name from Quarantine Cooking. to something else, right? Have y'all got any ideas, Theresa, Eddie? - [Theresa] I'm hoping. people will send some ideas. - Okay, good, that's what I'm hoping too, that y'all will send some ideas. You know, I have asked people out there if they had a favorite recipe, to send it to me, and I. would share it with everybody if they were one of those kind of people that like to share. I have gotten so many. sweet, sweet letters, and so many recipes for me to try. Well, the recipe that we're gonna do today is, it's another super simple, and there's a good chance that you might have. everything in your house that is required for this recipe. And the name of this recipe. is Pineapple Pudding. So I'm assuming that. this was not a side dish, but a dessert piece, because it sounds like vanilla. ice cream might be real good, might taste like a pineapple sunday. You know, if you had some ice cream on it. But, Lindsay Perelli sent me this, and Eddie, go ahead and make fun of me right now.. - [Eddie] I'm not gonna make fun of you now.. - He makes fun of me when I say some words, and Boston, Massachusetts is one of them. He makes fun. How am I supposed to say it? - [Eddie] You said it, you said it right? - I did say it right, Massachusetts. - [Eddie] Nope, that you said it right. (Eddie and Paula laughs) - Well, I've always said Massachusetts. - [Eddie] Yeah, you're. putting the T in the wrong- - Is that right or wrong? - You're putting the T in the wrong spot. Massachusetts. - Say that one more time. - [Eddie} Massachusetts. - Massachusetts. - [Eddie] Yip, there you go. - See, I don't see no C-H-E-W. in there anywhere, chew. - [Eddie] Well, there's. no W, but there's a C. - [Theresa] There's a C and a H. - Yeah, but it, to me, Massachusetts. - [Eddie] Chusetts. - I'd wind up saying. something really (indistinct) trying to pronounce it. But anyway-. - [Eddie} Let's just go with Boston. - Thank, Boston. What a great town. The city, that is. Lindsay Perelli lives there. in that town in Boston. And she sent me this pineapple pudding. And this is an old family recipe. She said, as long as she can remember, this is one of the dishes that was on the counter, on the table. So, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Lindsay,. for sharing it with me, and all of our friends out there. You know, I really can appreciate a quick, quick, easy dish, you know, that I can do in an emergency, when I'm in an emergency. All right, so it's four eggs. Is that a stick of melted butter? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Okie doke, I thought it. looked like a whole stick. Eddie, could you hand me. that spatula right there, that little? Yeah, yeah, thank you. This is an old one. It's says, ""Hey, y'all,"" I love those little narrow ones. I can get it down in my jar of mayonnaise, and get every drop out. All right, cup of sugar. So I'm gonna beat this up. You know what, Eddie? Somebody just sent me- - [Eddie] That whisk, yeah. - Yes.. - [Eddie] Right there. - Oh, it's right here. - [Eddie] The Danish whisk. - It's a Danish whisk, and someone sent this to me 'cause they've seen me, you know, getting a regular. whisk all gummed up. You know, if you're doing something thick and I don't have the name of the person on my. tongue right this minute, that sent this. So, didn't I write it down? - [Eddie] We did, we did. a little video last week. - Oh we did?. - [Eddie] Yeah. - Oh, okay. So I've already thanked ya, but I'm gonna thank ya again. So let's see how it works. This'll be the first time I've ever used a Danish whisk. Gosh, that works pretty good, y'all. You know where it would. really tell how good it is, is if you were mixing up. flour, something real stiff, boy hottie, this would do the trick. Look it's even got that. little tiny hole right there that can beat up little things. I like it, I like it a lot. All right, 20 ounces of. crushed canned pineapple. And Lindsay didn't say. whether or not you drain it. So, if it doesn't say. drain, I don't drain. This is great, this is a great- - [Theresa] Tool. - Yes, all right. So I have prepared a dish. Now, Lindsay says she uses a 9 x 9, but she said a 13 x 9 will work also. Now I've sprayed this,. so it'll be nonstick. And she said, they'll use. a whole, the whole thing. The whole loaf of French bread. - [Theresa] Italian. - Italian bread, was that... Yeah, one loaf of Italian. bread, broken into pieces. Use the whole loaf, she says. So I'm gonna have to kinda mash.... - [Theresa] I know. - To fit in here. I'm thinking the 13 x 9 x 2 pans. - [Theresa] Well, she puts. a little note on there. - Yeah, she said you can use a 13 x 9 x 2. I don't-. - [Eddie] It must soak down once you put all that in. - Yeah, I mean, you know. it's gonna soak it up, but I think we need to. switch over to a 9 x 13. So y'all hold on, I'm going to the pantry. Okay, Lindsay said, if you don't wanna use a 9 x 9, you can use a 13 x 9. Well, I'm telling you, I just don't think this 9 x 9 is gonna hold all this stuff. So I ran to the dish pantry and I got... That don't smell good, does. it, when it gets up your nose? All right.. - [Eddie] I think Lindsay said she was a school teacher in Boston. - Oh, is she? - [Eddie] So hopefully this. (indistinct) is going well. - Oh, gosh, have they gone. back to school in Boston, or are they virtual right now, Eddie? - [Eddie] I'm not sure. - [Theresa] Lots of schools are different. Oh, well all you teachers. out there, Lindsay, y'all deserve a big old pat on your back because that was such a humongous change in our life. So I hope all is well, and I hope that you're still. doing what you love to do, and that's teach, like you're teaching me today to make this pineapple pudding. (Paula laughs) (Eddie laughs) - [Theresa] Needless to say- - Dang gum it, get back up in there. You know, I take these apart,. you know, to wash them, and so once you take them apart- - [Theresa] they come apart. - They come apart. Okay, so I'm just gonna. make sure I spread this out to cover all of our Italian bread, you know, so it can all soak in. Like I said, I'm gonna make sure every drop can get down in there and do what it's supposed. to do to that Italian bread. It looks delicious, doesn't it? So what you think so far, Lindsay? Are we doing good, girl? Okay, so she tells us to slip this into a preheated oven, and she says, bake it in a 400 degree oven. Pour the mixture out and bake until bubbly and golden brown on top,. about 30 to 40 minutes. She said, ""Enjoy warm or chilled."" So, 30 to 40 minutes, which oven do you want me to put this in? - [Theresa] To the left-hand side, please. - Over here? Okay. That one was set at 400,. so we are ready to go. And I'm gonna set the timer. - [Theresa] I have the timer. - Okay, 30 minutes, Theresa. - [Theresa] Yeah, let's start there. - Yeah. So you're gonna be amazed at how quick that 30 minutes goes by. I told y'all it'd be a. quick 30 or 40 minutes on that pineapple pudding, didn't I? Well, it's ready. And it looks delicious. Oh, it's getting nice and toasty brown, just like Lindsay said it would. Wow, doesn't that look good? - [Theresa] Yum. - I'm gonna just a little teeny taste. Whoa. - [Eddie] I can hear it sizzling. - I know, it will burn your mouth up. This calls for ice cream, y'all. - [Eddie] Definitely.. - Definitely ice cream or fresh whipped cream. Look at the steam coming up, but isn't that pretty? It almost looks like. creamed corn, doesn't it? But it's not. I'm scared.. - [Eddie} And It kind of smells like fresh. bread has just been baked. With that Italian bread.. - Come get your spoon, come get your spoon, Theresa. It's good. - [Theresa] What, you want me to burn my mouth with you? - No, please blow on it before. you pop it in your mouth. It's not real sweet. - I love that. - So to me, when something. is not too sweet, it screams for ice cream. And the ice cream is gonna. marry perfectly with that. My spoon is even piping. hot from dipping it. - [Theresa] It's good though. - Ain't it good? - [Theresa] Hmm. - [Theresa] I would tell you though, the only other thing I would say is like we talked about in. one of the little breaks, it could probably go bigger than a 9 x 9, but smaller than 9 x 13, and it would be a little bit juicier. You like it like- - I don't know, I think this size was-. - [Theresa] Perfect? Absolutely perfect for it. It reminds me of my. pineapple casserole recipe that I love to serve with ham. - [Theresa] Have we made that?. - It's just real, real good. Yeah, I think we've made it. - [Theresa] Yeah, we made. it for one of our TV shows that we did, but I don't. think we made it yet for this, so we might have to pull that out. - And you can see how this is kinda dry, you know, 'cause it. wasn't much liquid in it. So again, that ice cream... (Paula laughs) I have been on an ice cream- - [Theresa] Kick.. - Kick, since we have been quarantined. Every night, every night I have ice cream. Oh.. - [Theresa] Lindsay, you did good. - Yes, she did. Thank you so much for sharing something that means a lot to your family. And I appreciate it, and that's gonna mean a lot to many more families out there. And I wanted to say something else. Oh, because it's not real, real sweet, this also would be good served with ham, with a baked ham. - [Theresa] Oh, yeah. - That's a sign. Thank you, Lindsay. I caught that crunchy bread.

tp1AuTyWffM.json;"- Hi y'all. It's me Paula. And I have got a confession. to make to y'all. I'm gonna share with y'all today Mama's Pound Cake recipe. But for the life of me, I don't remember whose Mama it is. I can't remember if it's my Mama's or somebody, Lulu's Mama, I can't remember. Because I think this was in my very first self-published cookbook. So anyway, it's good. So I'm gonna share it with y'all today. And we're gonna start. with two sticks of butter and a half a cup of solid shortening. And we're just gonna cream that up. It's a very simple,. basic pound cake, y'all. (mixer whirring) So you can take this. with any way you want to. I'm gonna flavor it. with almond and vanilla. And I wish I had some lemon extract cause I think that's probably. what I would do today if I had it. All right, so we're gonna add our sugar (bowl clinking) And I'm just gonna cream this up. And then we have our flour, and we have five eggs and we've got one cup of milk. And we're gonna alternately, add the flour and the milk. Alternately, we're gonna. start with our flour and we're going to end with our flour. Don't ask me why, but it. makes a creamier cake so- - [Theresa] Miss Paula, don't forget that I put salt and baking. powder in the flour. - Oh, thank you, Theresa. So this was all purpose flour and it has baking powder. I think it's baking powder and salt. Yes, it's baking powder. We added a half a. teaspoon of baking powder and a half a teaspoon of salt to our all purpose flour,. which was three cups. So this is a very, very. standard pound cake recipe. Very, very standard. And I have a feeling, it. was probably my Mama's. (mixer whirring rapidly) That it was my Mama's, but it couldn't be somebody else's Mama but I don't think so. Cause it sounds so close. to my grandmother Paul's only she used, she added sour cream in. hers instead of the milk. (mixer stirring) So we wanna cream this 'till it's just kinda light. And then we're gonna add. our eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Okay. This is the last of the flour. And then, it's time for me. to choose the flavoring. How we wanna go with this cake. And Eddie said, ""Almond! Almond!"" And I have a tendency to agree with him. What did you use Theresa. on the one that you made? - [Theresa] The rule follower. used what the recipe said. So it's called. - And what did he call for, - [Theresa] The vanilla. - Vanilla. (laughs) - [Theresa] But now. Grandmother Paul's recipe asks for both. - Yes. - [Theresa] Vanilla and almond. - Yes, and I am going to do just that. I'm going to use two flavorings. And I have shown y'all how. to make this wonderful, wonderful homemade vanilla,. because it's so expensive. I mean, you buy a good. vanilla and it is expensive. Okay so. I wanna say, I love. the little black pieces. Can you get that? Can you see that Eddie? Have y'all ever bought ice cream that says vanilla bean?. - [Theresa] Vanilla bean. - When you get those little black flakes from the vanilla bean,. that's when I like it. All right, now I'm. going to add a teaspoon. I'm gonna fill it up real good, with almond. (laughs) This is going to tempt Michael so bad on his keto diet. So I don't think that. this is keto friendly. (mixer whirring) Okay, so I think we've. got everything in it. Don't you Theresa? - [Theresa] Oh, yes Ma'am. Now see, I could just. walk off with that bowl. - I know you could! Theresa gave up sugar for Lent, y'all. And I would forget, and. every time we'd come in here and shoot these little videos, I'd offer her something sweet. She said, ""You know, I gave it up for Lent but I can have some on Easter Sunday."" - [Theresa] And I was better. than I thought I was gonna be. - I know I asked her. when she came in today I said, ""Well, did you kill yourself eating sugar on Easter Sunday?"" And all you do is eat raw batter, right? - [Theresa] Yeah. That's not good. - Did you eat the banana banana pudding? - [Theresa] I ate the banana pudding. - Right, what did I do with my? Well Carrie, for Easter,. Carrie made banana pudding, Not Yo Mama's.. - [Theresa] Me too. - Am I getting this all. over me or is it water? And I made Grandma Hiers' carrot cake. - [Theresa] Well, I have. every friend that I know, asks for Not Yo Mama's Banana. Pudding as their birthday cake. - Really?. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - (laughs) People love it. - [Theresa] So, if you. haven't seen that video or you haven't made that, you just need to see that one too. - Uhuh. - [Theresa] Let me help you. - Please this is so heavy. - [Theresa] Why don't. I hold it and you may- - This is so heavy Theresa. - Well, how about you, let me hold it. - Wait I'm fixing the. loop. Okay I got it now. You just spin, spin, spin. Did you use this size bundt? - [Theresa] I sure did. I think I did. - [Paula] And because some. are bigger than others. Whoa. - [Theresa] Mine might have. been, a tiny bit bigger. - [Paula] Okay, oops. All right, I think, maybe, I can just start doing it this is way. - [Eddie] Oh that smells so good. - [Paula] Doesn't that almond. smell delicious, Eddie? Okay. Theresa, if you could. help me one more time, please. - [Theresa] Certainly. - And let's kinda turn. it, so we go to this side. - [Theresa] How about I hold it? - [Paula] Okay. Thank you. You want me to accidentally. leave a little batter in here? - [Theresa] Yes, please.. You don't normally. (laughing) - I know, but- - You're chintzy when it comes to that. - I know. You know, I. wanna get every piece due out of my pots. Okay. That's it. - [Theresa] Now, do you. slam that a little bit. - [Paula] Not this one. I do my layer cakes but... - [Theresa] Okay. Is there a. reason why not this one versus, or is it already dense enough? Wow. It's a very dense cake. Whoa. - [Theresa] Okay. So you. put yours in the oven 'cause they're not going. to get to see yours and then you show them mine. - Yes - [Theresa] 'Cause it's so pretty. - It is beautiful. - [Theresa] It did turn out good. - All right. And do you want me to make a glaze? Some kind of glaze for yours? - [Theresa] No. You know I like- - Because I can make a. nice little lemon glaze. - [Theresa] I got a lot. I don't need it for, for me personally, because I like it just like- - You like it plain. Okay. - [Theresa] You know why because. I'm like how you grill it. - Yes, toast it. You toast it. - [Theresa] I toast it. Are you not gonna lick your dish? - [Theresa] Yeah, not yet though. - Well, you better get or I am. - [Theresa] Eddie's gonna. go all over it too though. - That's some ever more good cake batter. - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - So, (singing) it's a Betty. Crocker's cake. (laughs) - [Theresa] It's probably not going to be as pretty as yours. - [Paula] No! - [Theresa] but I'm pretty proud of it. - [Paula] This is a beautiful cake. And Michael Groover would. kill himself eating this cake because it's got that nice crust on it. And he does love that crust. So... - [Theresa] It's hard not to. - [Paula] You can actually turn it over, depending on which way. you like to look at it. - [Eddie] I like it that way. - [Paula] So does Michael.. Michael likes it this way too because he sees he's got more crust. - [Theresa] It does.. - [Eddie] Yeah. - But it's probably. prettier the other way. Especially, if you gonna make. a glaze and pour over it. - [Theresa] True. - 'Cause you need those. cracks so that glaze could... So it's totally up to you. You did a great job Theresa. - [Theresa] Thank you. I'm pretty proud. - [Paula] I'm gonna lose my job. It's what I'm gonna do. - [Theresa] We don't. have to worry about that. - She's going to be the prep cook. - [Theresa] Yep. - And the cook cooker. - [Theresa] I don't have that personality. - So which way do you want it Theresa? - [Theresa] It looks perfect that way. - Okay. It is. 'Cause that glaze, it. run down those cracks. - [Theresa] I know but I think that's it- - That glaze that you don't want. So love and best dishes y'all! Mama's Pound Cake, sure is good. I just don't know whose. mama it is. (laughs)";['postres']

tT0f2ltqPbY.json;"- Hey, friends. Y'all come on in the kitchen because I am fixing to share a recipe with y'all that I have. had for years, and years, and years, and years. I can't remember exactly. how long it goes back. But that's the Eclair Cake. And if you like chocolate eclairs, I think you're gonna love this one. And earlier today, I made another video of one of the most incredible recipes you will ever put in your mouth. And that's Paula Dean's Family Kitchen's Ooey Gooey Butter Pancake. It's just heavenly. Did I call it by its right name? Ooey gooey, - Butter.. - Ooey Gooey Butter, Gooey. (chuckles) Ooey Gooey Butter Cake Pancakes. That's right. So if you wanna look it up, you can look that up. because it was incredible. Just please y'all look for that video and let me know what you think 'cause it's really delicious, as well as this Eclair Cake that I'm fixing to make is very delicious. So I'm gonna start and you know you can always go to the link on any of these videos to get the correct measurements 'cause I know it's hard to absorb everything and every ingredient. All right, so I've got 3 1/2 cups of milk. I've got two 3 1/2 ounce package of instant vanilla pudding mix. So I'm just gonna mix that. And it doesn't take that. long to get thick, y'all. So, easy-peasy. (mixer rattling) Now after this gets thick, we've got one more step for this, and it calls for a eight ounce container of a frozen whipped topping. And y'all know, I just, I just too much don't. use that sorta thing. I always whip my own whipping cream. I love fresh whipped cream. So that's what I've got. But if you like the taste. of the frozen toppings, by all means use it because it does make. it a little bit easier. (mixer rattling) I'm gonna turn this up a little bit. (mixer whirring) And it's starting to thicken. (mixer whirring) I don't know if y'all can see, but it's gettin' really thick. (Paula laughing) I'm gettin' it all over me. I'm gonna be very, very sweet when I get through with. this (chuckles) video. All right, we're gonna move down here. And I have my buttered 13x9x2 pan and I'm gonna layer it. with graham crackers. (crackers rattling) And this is gonna make our Eclair Cake, this part right here. (crackers crunching). (crackers rattling) And we're actually gonna. wind up with two layers of graham crackers. Okay, so, now I'm gonna take our whipped cream, or our frozen whipped topping, dessert topping, whichever you wanna use. And I think that's thick enough. Let me see, I'll have to. refer back to the recipe. It's been so, so long since I made it. Oh gosh, I bet it's. been six or seven years since I made this. Okay, so we're just gonna fold our pudding into our whipped cream. Is this yours, Theresa? I don't ever recall seeing this. It's got to be yours.. - Yes. - I like it. That's a nice measuring cup. It's light and you don't have. to worry about breaking it. - [Theresa] I know. - Okay, so we're just gonna fold that in and that fresh cream is gonna just make that instant pudding, like, velvety. It's gonna take it to another level. You won't think of it. being an instant pudding by the time we get that all folded in. Okay, so we're gonna pour a layer of this over our crackers. This is one of those great,. quick and easy desserts. You know, if you have last minute company show up, you know, you can serve 'em this and they'll just think you baked all afternoon, preparing it for them. One little scoop. Make sure we got those edges done. (water burbling) Now, we're gonna put that other layer of graham crackers on top. I think I like 'em turned that way, like, longways. (crackers crunching) So we're gonna wind up. with the last layer, being graham crackers. (crackers crunching) That one broke, but that's all right. Okay, let's slip one right in there, then right in there. Then right in there. Okay. So, another layer of pudding. So you can see, this is turning into what we think of as a chocolate eclair but where's the chocolate? Where's the chocolate, Theresa? I don't see any chocolate. (Paula laughing) - It comes next.. - I'm funnin' ya, I'm funnin' ya. I see it.. - I was gonna go, ""What are you talking about?"" (Paula chuckling) - [Paula] Mmm, mmm, mmm. All right, so here we go, the last layer of graham crackers and that pudding tastes. so good and so rich. Don't know where my rag went. (water burbling) Okay, the final layer. (crackers crunching) You know what? Having these (chuckles) graham crackers out there, you know what. it's made me hungry for? You wanna make a guess, Eddie? - [Eddie] I'll say s'mores. - That's exactly what. it's made me hungry for. Some s'mores. I'd love some more s'mores, please. (crackers crunching) Okey dokey. Now it is time to make the chocolate part of our Eclair Cake. (water burbling) And the chocolate ingredients for the top is 1 1/2 cups of confectionate sugar, 1/2 a cup of unsweetened cocoa, three tablespoons of butter, softened, a third of a cup of milk, two teaspoons of light corn syrup, and a couple a teaspoons. of vanilla flavoring. So we are just going to cover the cake with the frosting and refrigerate for 24 hours because we do want this to be firm enough. that we can cut it, right? And let those graham crackers, you know, soak up some of that goodness. All right, so we're gonna blend together sugar, cocoa. Then we're gonna add. the butter and our milk, and we're gonna mix that well, and then we're gonna add the corn syrup and the vanilla. And we're gonna, well, it says we don't. even have to use a mixer. It's been so long since I've made it. I don't remember. But I'm gonna go ahead and mix our two dry ingredients together. And I'm just gonna whisk that together. I wanna make sure that. my confectionate sugar and my cocoa is all incorporated very, very well. (whisk clinking) So then I'm gonna add my butter and my milk. And even though it didn't tell me to, I'm going to. (beaters rattling) I'm going to use my beaters on it, because I can trust this. (mixer whirring) Well, I can't trust my arm. if it wears out. (chuckling) So we're gonna make sure we. get this nice and creamy. (mixer whirring) So, so easy y'all. And you can always change this up with different extracts or, you know, really whatever you want. You can make it have any. flavor that you want. Now this is our two teaspoons. of white corn syrup. And now we need two teaspoons. of vanilla flavoring. That's one, two. Two healthy (chuckling) teaspoons of vanilla flavoring. I love extracts, y'all. All right, so we're just gonna beat this for a few minutes. (mixer whirring) And then we're gonna top our Eclair Cake. (mixer whirring) So we're gonna just pour this over the top of our last layer of graham crackers. This is like a frosting. to our chocolate eclair. This is a great recipe, y'all, to take to a potluck supper. Transports and eats very, very easy. So the bad part about this recipe is we got to wait 24 hours. And I don't have a backup, (chuckling) so we gonna have to wait. (chuckling) - [Theresa] It's a good. make the day before recipe. - Oh, it's perfect. (water burbling) It's perfect. Okay, so see y'all in 24. (chuckles) We are gonna pretend like. it's been 24 hours, okay? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - You got your fork ready? - [Theresa] I got my fork. - Okay, you get that side. and I'll get this side. - [Theresa] Okay. Oh, look at that. (Paula laughing) - I'm (indistinct) into it.. - Well, you saw how easy it was, Theresa. - My God. (Paula laughing) - I know you don't like. the dark chocolate as much, but I love dark chocolate. - Do you? - [Theresa] Mm-hmm. - Tastes like fudge on top of it, doesn't it?. - I know, mm-hmm. (Paula chuckles) - Another one of those wonderful- - Easy. - Mm-hmm. - Eddie, you're gonna like this. - Mm-hmm. (laughing) Happy Birthday, Maddie. You didn't clean out your. bite real good, Theresa. (Theresa chuckles) (water burbling) I hate it when I have to. even up everybody's cutting. (Paula chuckling) Mmm, yum-ola. - He's gonna love it. - He is gonna love it. Eddie just said, ""Well, Paula, aren't you gonna say, 'Bye'?"" (chuckles) Bye, y'all. A cake had me very distracted.";['postres']
tWPmUSihFZA.json;- I'm sharing with y'all the last recipe for apples that I'm preparing to share with y'all. Bobby's gonna be bringing in. the fifth and final recipe, but this is it for me. with the apples y'all, everything we've made has been so good. All right. We might have saved best for last, I don't know. I don't know how you. feel about cheesecake, that's what we're doing this time. And I'm gon' start with two cups of flour, and half a cup of brown sugar, and we just gonna cut that in. I'm gonna bring it down here, where it's not so high up for me. So I'm just gonna mix up our brown sugar and our flour. And now, I'm gonna take two. sticks of butter, y'all. And this'll, this is, this process will take a few minutes, but, that's all right, it'll be worth it. So I'm just slicing our two sticks of butter, into our flour and brown sugar. That'll just make it. easier for me to cut it in, rather than just dropping. the whole stick in there. See what I'm saying?. (Paula chuckling) Okay. This is so nice and soft though. It's not gonna be any problem. Okay. I love I love saving these, and using 'em to butter my pan with, so things won't stick. Just take it and turn it, and butter your pan. But on this particular recipe, we are recommending that that you cover your 13x9x2 in tin foil. So we're not gonna need. that for that purpose. So we just gon' cut this. into our flour mixture, until it's like crumbly. All right, I got the bulk of it blended with the pastry cutter, but then I have come in at the end with one of my rubber spatulas, and just incorporated the little bit that maybe didn't get quite mixed together good using this, so, finished it up with a spatula, and it's nice, and good and crumbly. So, I'm gonna take our dough now, and I'm gon' try to press it. (alarm buzzing). Uh-oh. - [Theresa] Sorry about that. - What's going on, Theresa? - [Theresa] This timer. doesn't (indistinct) - All right, so I'm. gonna take out our dough. And like I said, I'm gon' press this. out as evenly as I can. Okay. Here we go. I may have to spray my hands with a little non-stick. I don't know, we'll see. There's plenty of butter there, so I should be able to do it. And this too will take just a few minutes to get it perfectly even. This does take a few minutes y'all, but just be patient and you'll get it. All right. I've got it as evenly as I can for the moment, and now, I'm gon' put this in a preheated 350-degree oven, and I'm gonna bake this. for about 15 minutes, or until it's light brown. While our crust is baking, I'm gon' go ahead and make the strudel topping for our cheesecake. And to do that, I'm using my brown sugar, oatmeal, you know, why did I get. out such a small bowl? I don't know. I forgot what I was making. Okay, so I'll transfer it. to a little larger bowl. And my flour, and now a nice, softened stick of butter. And this topping kinda reminds me of you know, kinda like a topping that you would put on a apple crisp, or even like the sweet potato casserole. You know how it's got that. strudel crunch top to it? Well, this is gonna be. just about like that. So, all we wanna do is. just cut our shortening, our butter into our dry ingredients, and we're gonna have it ready, and our crust should be. ready in just one minute. I've had it in the oven about 10 minutes. All right, now I'm gonna let these take over, which is what God intended for us to use, so I'm just gonna work. that in with my hands. And my hands will help. soften the butter even more, because, I'm still alive.. (Paula laughing) And my, and my hands are warm, which is a good sign, y'all. Every day you wake up on. the right side of the dirt, it's a good day. Just take care of your. problems and move on. And if you don't have no problems, even better. Sit back and kick your feet up, and wait for your apple. cheesecake to get ready. Okay. It's coming together so good, and you can see it's crumbly. It's gonna be delicious y'all. And I know it may seem like. a kind of a long recipe, but it's really not. You know, if you go ahead, and get up all your ingredients, have them set up, it's just like three steps. And my next step, really my last step, is making the cream cheese, the actual cheesecake. I have two eight-ounce packages of cream cheese in my bowl, and I'm going to beat these until they're smooth, no lumpy, lump, lumps, with my sugar. Then I'll be adding one egg at the time, and then we're gonna pour that on top of our warm crust. Okay, so here we go. I'm gon' let this get. beat up for a few minutes, (mixer whirring) just to make sure it's nice and creamy. Now I'm gonna add my sugar, and just beat all this until it's nice and incorporated. And I'm going to stop a couple a times, and incorporate the ingredients. on the side of my bowl, into the bottom part of my bowl, because they won't get mixed in good, if you don't, if you don't do that, so.. (mixer whirring) Gonna add my eggs one at the time. (mixer whirring) All right, we're gon' get. those sides back down again. Oh my gosh, that looks so good and so creamy. I think cheesecake might be one of America's. favorite desserts, don't you think? Every restaurant you go into, has some form a cheesecake. All right, my last egg. And while I got that stopped, I'm going gonna go ahead. and add my vanilla too. And I'm gon' put about. two teaspoons of vanilla. (mixer whirring) We're gettin' close! (mixer whirring) Look at this. You know, it's been a little bit, since I've made a cheesecake, so I'm excited. All right, now we're gonna pour this onto our warm crust. And the reason we precooked the crust, is we wanted to make completely sure that it got done all the way through. So, a a good way to see that that happens is precooking it for a few minutes. I'm gon' have to turn this around. I'm right-handed, not left-handed. Whoa. Michael, Groover's gonna be sorry he left when he did, Daddy. He went and took a nap too, too soon. Right? All right. I think I'm gon' just. leave that in that bowl. All right. I've got my diced apples, y'all, and I'm tossing some cinnamon in there, and some fresh, grated. nutmeg that I grated, and a little bit of sugar. So I'm just gonna toss those around in the spices and the sugar. So this is where we get. our apple cheesecake. So we're gon' to do those. as evenly as we can. This is like having your cake, and eating it too, you know? I mean, it's like a apple pie, a Grandgirl's Apple Cake from Georgia, and a cheesecake.. (Paula laughing) It's a wonderful world. Alrighty. All right, and last comes our streusel. And this too should be just kinda evenly sprinkled over. Oh, this looks so good. Michael is gon' love this, 'cause his favorite dessert that his mama made was a was a apple crunch, or a pear crunch? Anyway, it had a crunchy top on it. And this has reminded me. of what he's described that his mother used to bake. for him on his birthday. (Paula chuckling) That, and a banana cake. Okay, that's it. It's going in the oven, y'all. 350. And let's see, let me jog my memory. It doesn't really say. how long it's gonna take. - [Theresa] I think it does, I think it says 25 minutes. - I didn't see it anywhere, but that doesn't mean. it's not there, Theresa. - [Theresa] At 350, bake 30 minutes.. - Okay. - [Theresa] Until filling is set. - Okay, okay, it's hot now. It's hot, 'cause it just came out of the oven. 30 minutes at 350, right? - [Theresa] That's correct. - It's time to taste our cheesecake. I don't know if it's cool enough, y'all, but we're gonna try. And I'm gon' try to make sure I don't chew on tin foil. Like I said, I really think it's a little too soon to be cutting this, but we are gonna do it anyway. It looks good, y'all. Look at that. And that tin foil kept our plate so clean. All right, now for a little drizzle of caramel. Who's hungry?. (Paula laughing) That looks very, very good. I love the combination, like I said, it's it reminds me of my regular cheesecake. It reminds me of Grandgirl's Apple Cake, a lot of nice flavors going on. Mm. Come taste Theresa, get your fork. And you bite into those fresh apples. Mm. I love the streusel topping on it. - [Theresa] I like all of it.. (Theresa laughing) I like a crust. - Mm-hmm, I do too. And the apple, the, the.. the way the apple kept its shape, and it's a little crispy, it's really good.. - [Theresa] I like it warm. - Mm-hmm, I do too. - [Theresa] I know that. cheesecake is supposed to be.. - Cold.. - Cold, but that's very good. - It's delicious. With fall coming up, and pumpkin season is gonna. be upon us very, very soon, I think.. and between the pumpkin and. the apples being in season, I think y'all will love this. - [Theresa] It is amazing. - So you know that we are. sending y'all loving best dishes, and we highly recommend this one, y'all. It's a winner.;['postres']

TXEL95etxfY.json;"- Hey, y'all. You know how much I. love hearing from y'all, the good and the bad and the ugly. I love hearing from you. And you know, I'm constantly saying, now, send me a recipe that was. your favorite in your family. And when y'all do that, I just love getting 'em. and reading over 'em. Well, this recipe today is from Callie Dycus. D-Y-C-U-S. And do we know where she's from? Oh. From Arkansas. - [Theresa] Arkansas. - So she says, ""Hey, Paula, I'm from Arkansas. And this Doodle Cake was. always a summer staple that my grandma made. I'm not sure where the. silly name came from, but it is so easy, and I. think everybody will love it."" So. Callie, how can you. not love a ""dump cake""? Which is what this is. So, I've got two cups. of all-purpose flour, two cups of white sugar. And I'm just gonna whisk our. dry ingredients together. I've got one teaspoon of baking soda and a fourth a teaspoon of salt. I don't get that. That little bit, I wouldn't think would make. a whole lot of difference. But by using... a whisk on it, it's almost like sifting, 'cause it breaks it all up and just mixes your dry. ingredients real good. So, the next thing we're gonna do is add one can, and I think 20-ounce... Yeah. A 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple. And I'm not... Juice and all, Callie say. So I'm not even gonna. use the mixer on this. I'm just gonna stir, stir. And Callie says to mix it well. This kind of reminds me of one of my ""better than sex"" cakes. (Theresa chuckling) Depends on how old you are, Susan. (Paula chuckling) - [Susan] I'm turning the. big seven-oh this year. - Are you? Well, I did that five years ago. - [Susan] Oh! You know where I'm at then. - I know where you're at. So 70 is the new 50. (Paula laughing) - [Susan] I like that. - What is 75 the new? 60. I'll take 60. (Paula and Susan chuckling) All right. So, how easy was this. cake to put together? I mean, it doesn't even. call for vanilla icing. I mean, vanilla flavoring. All-righty. So I'm gonna put this in our prepared 13"" by 9"" by 2"" pan. And when I say ""prepared,"" that means it's been sprayed and ready to greet the ingredients. All right, so, Callie,. you tell me to put this in a 350-degree oven, preheated, for 30 to 35 minutes, so that's what I'm gonna do! Okay, our... What is this? What is this cake called? Doodle. - [Theresa] Doodle Cake! - Doodle Cake. (Paula laughing) And thank you, Callie, for. sending us this recipe. I'm melting the butter now, because Callie says to frost this cake... It says it comes outta the oven. So, I'm melting my sugar. I mean, I'm melting my butter. And then I'm gonna add... Was this one can, Theresa, or... - [Theresa] It's two-thirds cup. - Okay. But it's- - [Theresa] So, no. It's not a can. - It's not a can.. - [Theresa] No. - Okay. We're using two-thirds of a cup of sweetened condensed milk. So I'm gonna pour that in. You know, you could... (Paula chuckling) You could put sweetened condensed milk on things that birds leave, and I swear it'd be good. (Paula chuckling) It just makes everything better. Look at that butter. You see that butter melting into that? Oh my goodness. This is gonna be so good. All right, let's see. She doesn't tell us to. poke holes in it, does she? - [Theresa] No, and that's. what I was wondering too, but it just seems like. it must sink into it. - You know what? I may just hit it with a... with the end of a spoon, a circular spoon. All right. I just added one cup of sugar, two-thirds a cup of. sweetened condensed milk, one stick of butter, and then I'm gonna add one cup of coconut, shredded coconut, and one teaspoon of vanilla. And it said, ""melt butter,. then add sugar and milk. Boil for three minutes. Remove from heat and. add vanilla and coconut and spread on cake while hot."" I shoulda had this done a few minutes ago. Right? 'Cause that cake is cooling as we speak. So this is what I'm gonna do. We'll have to find the right spoon. Okay, this is right. It has a round... I'm just gonna poke a few holes just to make sure. Oh my gosh, look how moist that is. Holy ka-moly. I'm not gonna do many, 'cause it is... delicious. Look, it's got nice and thick. So now I'm gonna add our coconut, and that was one cup. That's boiling good. All right. And now our vanilla. And I know I've told y'all about my newest product for the store is this wonderful,. wonderful vanilla extract. And it's... It's so incredible. I might not even be making my. own vanilla flavoring anymore. - [Eddie] Well, we just did a giveaway, where you gave away-. - Yes, we did do a giveaway. - [Eddie] Like, peppermint.. - Did we hear from peo- - [Eddie] Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah. - Okay, here we go. I wish our cake was a little bit hotter. I dropped the ball on that one. Mm. Wow. I am glad I put a few holes in it. Maybe it'll catch a little bit of that. Awesome in the summer. This looks wonderful. Like a pineapple cake with cooked icing on top. (spoon knocking against dish) Pieces of brown in there where the butter was starting. to turn brown for us. I like that, Callie. I like seeing that. See? That's from the butter. - [Theresa] Did you get all of it? - [Paula] I got all of it. Best I could. Sister. - [Theresa] I'm always. scared to pull your- - [Paula] Oh, yeah. Oh, my little Davis. Ow! That is hot icing. My little Davis comes into my kitchen, Jamie and Brooks. Third little boy. And he says, (Paula patting her stomach) ""Giggi? Hot cake? Hot cake?"" (Paula patting her stomach) I could squeeze his little head off. By ""hot cake"" he means a cake that's got birthday candles lit in it. (Theresa chuckling) So to him, that's a ""hot cake."" I think it's cute. (water running) All right. Should we cut a little piece? Or should we wait? She doesn't say. So. I'm gonna cut it. I went and grabbed me a small paper plate. That way, I'm not as. tempted to cut a big piece. You know what I mean? (knife clicking against dish) Oh. Holy ka-moly! Every bit of that on my plate. Oh, it's coming out so good. Mm. Y'all get y'all a fork. Oh, my goodness. The icing is like... Almost... Not chewy's the word, but... Mm! It just has substance to it, (water running) for lack of a better word. Theresa, get your fork, honey- - [Theresa] Lent, baby. - And bring- - [Theresa] No sweets for me. - Huh? Oh! She's in Lent. You know... - [Theresa] So make Eddie. - I'm Baptist, and that's working out. pretty good for me right now. (Paula chuckling) Whoa. Callie, thank you so much, honey, for sharing your grandmother's recipe with the rest of us, because it's out of this world. And so easy to make. Thank you, Callie.";['postres']
tZgd322x8h4.json;- Y'all come on in and join me 'cause I'm. fixing to make probably, it's one of the top. three cakes that I make, and everybody has made one, I'm sure, one time in their life,. and that's a carrot cake. And this recipe was given to. me by my grandmother, Hiers, my daddy's mama, and I just thought her. recipe was the best of all. So, and it's so simple. I pulled out a mixer, but you know, I really don't have to have one. And in my cookbook I was just. reading the instructions. And this is just the way. grandma gave it to me. She said bake for 40 minutes. I think that's too long. I've never baked these for 40 minutes. So I'm gonna start with two cups of sugar. I'm gonna add two cups. of all purpose flour. I'm gonna add two. teaspoons of baking soda, one teaspoon of salt, and two teaspoons of ground cinnamon. Now all I want to do for that is just kind of whisk it together, it's almost like sifting, you know, when you use this whisker, Not a whisker up here, but this one. Am I saying that right, Andy, whisker? - Whisker.. - It's a whisker, isn't it?. - It is, yeah. (laughing together) It just sounds funny 'cause I think about them little black hairs. that's coming out of my chin. And y'all know what I'm talking about. Where them ugly things. come from, I don't know. Alright, so now I'm gonna add my eggs. And that's four eggs. Let's see what else I want to add. I wanna add one and a half. cups of vegetable oil. And this is what makes. that carrot cake so good. In fact, if you're baking. a cake that calls for oil, you know that sucker is gonna be good and it's gonna be moist. (whisker whirring) Alright, I'm gonna add. two teaspoons of vanilla. That's maybe one and a half. My vanilla is so good, y'all, this is a pure extract. Let's see ingredients,. Madagascar Bourbon vanilla bean. That's it. Yummy. Alright, so I'm gonna stir that in and then I'm gonna stir in my carrots, and that's three cups. If you got nothing but whole carrots and you got a food processor, you can chop 'em up good in that. If you've got babies in the house and you've got baby carrot food. I've made it with two. jars of baby carrots, and that's good too. But I just like being. able to see the carrots. Alright, now, so we got to decide at this point, where do we want our nuts? Do I wanna put nuts in the cake and then make the cream. cheese icing without nuts? Or do both? You know, it's like my vanilla extract, you can't have too much nuts. So, now grandma always use pecans, but I have just gotten where. adore the flavor of walnuts. So that's what I'm stirring in. Okay, so I'm gonna wait and decide how I wanna. do the nuts stuff later. - [Eddie] But you're putting raisins and. - Oh, I forgot my raisins.. - I was like, hmm. - That's the only, thank you, Eddie. This is the only change I made. in my grandmother's recipe is I add raisins, and Theresa, I just told her the last second, so she didn't have any measured up. And I just put it till. I liked the looks of it. - [Eddie] I think that makes the cake. - Oh, I do too, to bite into those soft raisins. Oh my gracious. It's like an oatmeal cookie. An oatmeal cookie to me is not an oatmeal cookie without raisins. So I had a good bit y'all, I probably add a half a. cup of raisins or more. But that's the only. change I made in her cake. And if you wanna plump 'em up, you could always have. your raisings sitting in some warm or hot water,. and that'll plum 'em up. Whatever falls out, okay. That's it. That looks perfect. Alright, now y'all know how. I measure out my batter, 'cause I I really do like for my cakes to all be the same size. And I'm the same way about. when I'm making cookies. Your cookies do so much better. if they're all the same size, if you use like one scoop for all of 'em. You know, maybe like a. miniature butter scooper, something like that. It's just important though. that they're all the same size So that they'll cook in the. same time and be the same size. Alright, I'm gonna put this in. a 350 degree preheated oven, but I'm gonna start checking. it after like 25 or 30 minutes. I just don't think we need 40. So to me is not a more appropriate cake for Easter than a carrot cake, right? Right, Theresa, and everybody out there?. - Absolutely. - And you know, you could actually make this in cupcakes and. keep your icing smooth with no nuts, and make a little carrot, I mean a little picture of a bunny on top. So there's lots of things you can do. - [Theresa] This cakes turned out perfect. - Yes, they are perfect. Do you see now why I'm a fanatic about measuring my batter out just right? So in my bowl, y'all, I got one stick of softened butter and I've got two eight ounce packages of cream cheese that has softened. So I've still been debating, I told y'all I was going debate. about how I did my icing. So I think, a couple of. teaspoons of vanilla. So I think I'm just gonna. keep this without nuts and then sprinkle nuts on top, that way people, if they didn't want nuts, too bad, 'cause there's. nuts inside the cake too. But if they didn't want extra nuts they could kinda just scrap them off. So grandma's recipe actually just called for one eight ounce. package of cream cheese. But you know, I can't stand. to be short on my icing, I'd rather have too much than not enough. And then your layers are so skimpy with your icing, drives me crazy. (laughs) In fact, Olivia told me yesterday, we were playing and she said, gammy, you so crazy. (laughs) - Well she's got your number.. - Yes. I mean, I can get down with 'em and act like I'm three. and a half too also. - [Theresa] That's what. gammy's are supposed to do. - That what they're supposed to do. Get down and dirty and silly. Alright, so it calls for a one pound package of cream cheese, and this was a two pound bag and it looked like half. of it had been used. So I may have to grab a. little bit powdered sugar. Come on. (whisker whirring) Yeah, Olivia couldn't have. given me a better compliment than laughing and saying, gammy, you so crazy. (laughs) Okay, I'm going, why do they make these cords. like they do is beyond me. Alright, I'm gonna get a. little bit more powdered sugar 'cause a one pound bag. Of powdered sugar equals about three and a half. cups of powdered sugar. So I don't know if we had. quite three and a half cups, but it can easily stand some more because I got the two eight, well I got one pound of. cream cheese in there, and that's what I got. Now if I can just see the,. why don't we put these on? Oh my gosh, it always. makes such a difference when you can see. Look at that. (laughs) Alright, that is most assuredly now three and a half cups, maybe four. (whisker whirring) I think that's like perfect. Perfect. Hmm, so good. So very, very good. Alright, let's see, what do I need? I like to do my icing, for some reason I just can't use one of those offset. spatulas, messes me up. And I just do just like my mama did, she would use a spoon and a. knife, and I do the same thing. Now, if I were gonna put nuts. around the side of this cake, y'all, I would make sure. I had some wax paper so I could put the nuts on the side, and then just slide the. pieces of wax paper out. So it would keep my cake plate clean. But since I'm not gonna do it that way. It's just an extra step. I don't have to do. Yeah. Poor Michael's trying to diet, so I've got him strawberry. salad and carrots, and then the carrot cake. It's terrible, isn't it? I think, like I said, I don't like to skip on the inbetweens. Alright, so layer number two. Okay, so I'm just gonna slip just regular toothpicks in, and you got to push 'em down enough so that they will go into the next layer. Alright, I'm gonna have to move now to a taller toothpick. A regular toothpick won't. go through all the layers. - So that's like a skewer.. - Yes, this is a skewer. Okay. Hmm, too tall. Gonna make sure you don't. get any wood shavings. Perfect. Okay. Okey dokey. Now I put my frosting on top of my cake and then I go around and bring it down. I think she's done. Alright, and I always like to make sure that my plate is clean. And I have to say, it's spreads on your cake so much smoother if you don't have the nuts in your icing. Oops, the nut fell in the side. Don't want a nut in the side. - [Theresa] Hmm, there might. be a nut on the side too. - Hmm, I'll get him. My pleasure.. - I'd hate for you to miss that. Yes, oh, this is so pretty. See how Eastery that looks? Alright, do you think we should cut it now or do you think we should wait? - [Theresa] Since when. have you ever waited? Come on, come on. Wow. Wow. Wow. Now, normally I don't. cut my cakes in wedges. I feel like you can get more by cutting it down the center and then slicing it each piece Like that, and I can get a lot more pieces out of it. - Like how good that looks.. - Hmm. Wow. Grandma you a angel. Hmm, thank you for having my daddy for me. 'Cause I loved him, my mother, and my brother, so very much. And without you grandmother Hiers, it wouldn't have happened. So thank you. Loving best dishes and happy Easter.;['postres']

UCnk3Jk1L_0.json;- Hey y'all, it's Jamie Deen here today and I'm in Mama's kitchen. I'm here to share one of my. favorite recipes with y'all. This is a brownie chocolate chip bar. This combines two of my favorite things, brownies and chocolate chip cookies and it turns them into one. Now the plan for this is. that it's the perfect dish to put on your table after the. big game coming up, you know, in February, I guess it is. So if you're not already subscribed to Mom's YouTube channel, this is the place where. you can come and find all of these recipes I've. shot 20 or 30 of these videos. I know Mom has probably shot a hundred. My brother shot them. We'd love to invite you all. to join our YouTube page so you can never miss out. on one of these recipes. They're always simple. They're always good for your family. And you know, they're always delicious. Well, let's get started. We've got two parts to this now. So chocolate chip and brownie. We're gonna start with. the chocolate chip part. These are homemade chocolate chip cookies. I've got my brown sugar that I'm gonna, let's see, I'm gonna, I'll try to give you the measurements 'cause. that's what Theresa would like for me to do. Although I know that you'll be able to find it on the page somewhere. That's one and a half cups. of packed brown sugar, and to that I'm gonna beat up these two sticks of butter. There's very few things more exciting than watching somebody grind up brown sugar and butter. But in spite of that, I'm gonna take a minute. and share with you all something that I've. been working on it too. I am building birdhouses. It's very exciting. My dad, who you may know. passed away in 2020, he was a big builder and. he loved to build things. And one of the last things. he built was a bird house. So after Daddy passed away, my brother and I got my daddy's tools and I decided shortly after Daddy passed that I was gonna make bird houses and sell a million of them and I'm gonna give all. the money to cancer. Well, over a period of time, I figured out that I wasn't. ready to move on to that. It took me a while. I walked around my daddy's. tools and I thought about it. And you know, I told my wife,. I said, for some reason, I'm not getting in there. I'm walking around the tools but it was my time to. grieve the loss of my daddy. It wasn't time to start my business. But one year after he passed away, I started Daddy's Birdhouse. I made 18 and I sold them, every birdhouse is a hundred dollars. I said, well, I'm gonna. give $90 to cancer, I'll keep 10 to help me buy. woods and stuff like that. It's too complicated. I just decided to give. all the money to cancer. So every birdhouse is a hundred dollars and I will give your a hundred dollars to the American Cancer. Society in honor of my daddy. And you get a homemade bird house. - [Paul] Can I run and get the bird house that you made for me and show everybody? - Sure. - [Paula] I'll be right back. - My Etsy page is called Daddysbirdhouse. It's all one word. So if you wanna check me. out on Instagram or Twitter, I've got a link there,. but Daddysbirdhouse. Spring's coming up so y'all need a bird house. for your little birdies. So go check out the bird houses I've made, you see I've been painting this morning, my hands got black paint all over them. It's just enough time for. me to give a commercial for my little business. So we've got our brown sugar and our butter beat together really well. And we're gonna add to this two eggs. One, (egg cracking) two and I'm gonna combine these two eggs with the brown sugar. (mixer grinding) and our butter. This is three things that start off many a delicious dessert recipe,. brown, sugar, butter, and eggs. (mixer grinding) - Knock, knock. This is the birdhouse y'all that Jamie made for me. And it was wood found in his daddy's shop after his daddy passed away and I would he never put this one outside because I just wanna keep it. in so I can protect it forever and one of the grandchildren can have it, but I love it, I love it so much. You know, I'm gonna brag a second on you. He is so good in the kitchen, y'all. He made a meal the other. night for his family and he was showing me the picture. Oh, where's your phone? - It's really hard y'all, it's steak and baked potato. - No, listen, you cook us, where's you phone? - I'm gonna combine two. cups of all purpose flour with say one cup of. chocolate chip morsels. - Not there. - I got a half a teaspoon of salt and I've got how much baking soda is this? One teaspoon of baking soda. - [Paula] I found it. - I'm gonna, good luck figuring. out the code to open it. I'm gonna combine all these ingredients. So, I'm gonna slowly incorporate the flour into our mixture here. (mixer grinding) So, I've got all this stuff combined. I'm gonna put that into, I'm gonna press it into. the bottom of this pan. You wanna steak that's cooked perfect. That one turned out pretty good. - And look at the other. things on the plate. His plate was so beautiful. - I made baked potato with mayonnaise and fresh onions on top and a roasted some cauliflower. - Wait, wait, wait, let us. see it a little bit longer. - They saw. - No. - You're gonna take a nine by 13 pan and line it with tin foil. And now that I've got our cookie dough, look, homemade cookie dough. See how simple that was? Is anybody able to. follow what I was saying between me talking about birdhouses and my mama and talking about a steak I made three nights ago? Probably not. - [Lady] She's so proud of you. - Well, I'm very proud of her. We are a blessed family. that are surrounded with talented people that. help us achieve things that most people can't. And I'm very proud of Mom, I'm very, very, very,. very proud of my brother. So I'm gonna spread this out. If this were my house, boy, don't you know I would. have some people wanting to lick this clean. My wife, Brooke loves cookie. dough more than she loves me? I don't know, it's close. Mm, look at this, this. is gonna be delicious. So if you have a favorite bar dessert, y'all leave a comment. And if you got a bar like maybe. you have when you were a kid and you can't remember how. to make it, let us know and maybe we can put one together for you. Hmm. All right, I got one more part of this. We run a little long here,. so we're gonna take a break. Let me reset, then we're. gonna do the brownie top. We'll get this baby in the oven. Y'all stick around, mm. Okay, y'all this part is super easy. This is just a box of. your favorite brownie mix. So whatever brand that you like to use, and we're gonna follow the recipes. So I've already put our brownie mix and we've got one third a cup of oil, we're using pure vegetable. oil and we have two eggs. This is just the. directions on the package. I'm gonna blend all this together. (mixer grinding) So we're following the. package just as it is. We've got this blended together well, and now we're gonna layer. Mm, I love bar dessert. I think it wasn't too long ago that my wife made some of. these, cookie bars are so good. I came home one day and. Brooke had made some, but she just made a. regular chocolate chip bar and this has got the. brownie element on the top. Mm, and you don't have to wait till there is football game. to make stuff like this. Just like when Brooke and the boys, when the boys and I got. home and we had seen that Brooke had made a special dessert in the middle of the week. for no reason whatsoever, but that's a good surprise. Okay, I've got all this pretty much even, now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the back end of my spoon and I'm gonna swirl this stuff together. So it'll be kind of marbled. when we cook it together, it doesn't have to be top or bottom. Get this nice swirl. And as it bakes and rises together, we'll get a little bit of the brownie down in the cookie dough and a. little bit of the cookie dough up in the brownie. Great time of day. Now this is gonna go into an oven that Theresa has turned on for us. It's at 350 and we're gonna cook this until the edges start to pull away. That's about 40 minutes. So that's what we're gonna start with. One last good deep swirl. Mm, mm, that's looking nice. Go into the oven for 40 minutes. That gives me time to clean up and maybe build a birdhouse or two. Y'all stick around, it's worth the wait. Hey y'all, look at this. That is a beautiful brownie. And you see how the brownies. still kind of gooey in there with the chocolate chip that's. firm in the middle of it? Mm, these are not gonna. last long around here. - Mm-mm. - Peach Groover is sitting right there. I promise you, he's thinking about a chocolate chip brownie bar. Y'all remember, when you. cut your first one out, stick these in the refrigerator. for about four hours. Really get them firm up so. you've got a good cookie bar. I couldn't wait any longer. though y'all, this is delicious. I hope you enjoy the big game. I hope your big team wins. and I hope you'll join me back here in Mama's kitchen. I see y'all around. Mm.;['postres']
UejC3Tqm0QE.json;- Hey y'all, welcome into my kitchen. I am gonna make the most. delicious, delicious dessert today and I'd be willing to bet that y'all all might have this recipe, but. I still wanted to share it just in case there's one person out there that'd never heard of it, and that recipe is Mountain Dew Cobbler. You wouldn't think about. putting Mountain Dew in your cobbler, would you? No, I hadn't, the only liquid I'd ever put in a cobbler was milk, so. this really intrigued me. Now the recipe calls for. two cans of crescent rolls, and you can see I floured my. cutting board a little bit so that my crescent rolls wouldn't stick, and I've just, I'm cutting. them apart at the seam, just like that. And then I'm gonna take my apple, calls for two apples, in quarters, you want eight pieces from an apple, because that's how many. dough strips you have. So I've already done some of 'em, 'cause I had a feeling. y'all didn't wanna watch me wrap 16 pieces of apple. So you wanna start at the big end, and just roll, roll, and. then you wanna put it seam side down in your casserole dish, and I sprayed this with a nonstick spray, just in case it wanted to stick. Perfect, that dish is. perfect for 16 of those. All right now, I've got. a cup of melted butter, and I have got a cup and a half of sugar, so I'm just gonna mix those together, and then I have my. cinnamon, that looks like about two teaspoons, I. think, right, Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes. - 'Cause Theresa measured all that for me, so we're just gonna mix. that up, and oh my goodness. - Mmm, my favorite things.. - That cinnamon. - [Theresa] Butter, sugar, and cinnamon. - Oh, and did I tell you this? One serving has 612 calories. Wait, I think Lulu's knocking. No, you're not going in there, no, no! Come on back in here.. - Come here, Lulu. - She wants to get in that living room because I bet she wants to pee-pee. - [Theresa] Come here, Lulu. Come here, Lulu. - All right.. - That's a rough job. - But I mean, like 612 calories, y'all, that is a lot. - [Eddie] You mean for just one little? - [Paula] For one serving, but I don't know how much? - [Eddie] Are two crescent. rolls a serving, please? - [Paula] 4.4 grams, how many servings? - [Paula] I would say like. a couple, wouldn't you? - [Theresa] Well Irish serving sizes, yes. - Yeah, it's funny because. I was thinking about my Krispy Kreme Donut Bread Pudding. This is right up here with that. All right, let me see what they say about, mix the melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl and spoon evenly. over the dough-wrapped apples. Oh my goodness. (laughs) Oh, another one per lifetime recipe. And isn't it apple. season right now, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yes, well I guess, I mean gosh, I mean it's kind of like a candied apple a little bit, right? - [Paula] Yeah, yeah. You know, I told you, I got. to go to an apple orchard in Connecticut or somewhere,. somewhere up north. Could've been in New York,. you know, upper New York. - [Eddie] Oh yeah, I mean. everyone has orchards up that way, but yeah, here in Blue Ridge, (bell rings) there's a really good one--. - Oh, really? - [Eddie] Up in Georgia, yeah. - Well you know, my magazine folks gave me an apple tree as, I. think it was a Christmas gift, and we got apples off of. it this year, didn't we? - [Eddie] Yeah, and. I'm not sure they were, they were mainly green. with a little bit of red, and but they were ready. like back in August. - I know. - [Eddie] I wanna say, and it's funny because I almost had Mike take them out back in the spring because. there was no leaves, no flowering or anything on. the trees, and then boom. - Well, well I was just shocked because it took two to three years, and I got one apple off of it. All right, now I need 12. ounces of Mountain Dew. Gotta turn around, I don't. now how to read millimeters, look at that, 12 ounces, minus that much. Good guessing, so now. we're just gonna pour this over our apple dumplings. (laughs) Oh my gosh. (laughs) Yum, that's all I got to say, yum. All right, now we're gonna bake this in a preheated oven,. naturally, at 350 degrees and I did grease my casserole dish, just in case, you know,. it got dry and stuck. (phone rings) All right, so it says to. cook for 45 to 50 minutes. I'll get the phone, Eddie,. it's the gate I think. (phone dial tone) Somebody may have gotten it. All right, 45 to 50 minutes. I'm gonna put it on 40 because sometimes I really need to have. these ovens calibrated, 'cause I think it could. be off a little bit, so it's important, you know, that you do check your ovens and you know, we can go get a little oven thermometer, so it's so easy to calibrate it yourself or to see if it needs. calibrating, let's say that. All right. Bessie May. 45 to 50 minutes. Y'all, that was the longest 45 minutes that I've spent in a long time. So if you want time to pass. slow, make this cobbler and wait for 45 minutes, and it'll feel like. that clock is creeping. Look at this wonderful. Mountain Dew Cobbler, Mountain Dew Apple Cobbler. It would be wonderful with fresh pears, let me see, what else. would it be good with? - Peaches?. - Ice cream? - You could do peaches,. yeah, you could do peaches. Oh, ice cream is a must. - [Theresa] Whipped cream. - Or fresh whipped cream. if you're on a diet. (laughs) Y'all, I told you 617 calories a serving, so look at the serving. bowls I got out for us. This'll give us an opportunity. to just taste, right? - [Theresa] I think you're. just trying to tease us. - [Paula] Oh gosh, it's. still very, very hot. We're getting a half a. crescent roll apiece. All right Theresa, have. you ever had this before? - [Theresa] Never. - Oh, come on. Eddie, is there any way you. can shoot all three of us? Can we do that? - [Eddie] No, I'll-- - Will you hand me a spoon? - Oh yeah, I got it out for you and then here it is, anybody. need some more juice? Mine needs a little bit more juice. - [Theresa] Oh no, I'm good. - You want some more juice, Eddie? - [Eddie] I'll get mine. - Huh?. - I'll get mine. - You'll get yours?. - Yes, I'll get mine. - Okay, picky petunia. (laughs) Do it yourself. - Oh my lord. - (laughs) What you say, you praying? Are you praying over there?. - Pretty much. - [Eddie] You just ate. 200 calories right there. - I know, but it's worth it. (spoon clinks) - [Eddie] So have you-- - Is it not the best cobbler. you've ever tasted, sorry-- - [Theresa] This is family. reunion kinda cobbler, where people gonna remember you. - [Eddie] Mountain Dew, I mean, have you, you said you have made it. or you have not made it? - I have.. - You have. - Yeah, it's just been a good while, what were you asking? - [Eddie] Well I was wondering, you know, what the, the Mountain. Dew, what it does to, from a different cobbler--. - Wonder if it's caffeine? - It makes it go-ood? - [Eddie] Makes it sticky, gooey. - I mean, I don't drink Mountain Dew. - [Eddie] Well it's pure sugar. - 'Cause it, yeah, and caffeine,. and I feel like most days I don't wanna get too jacked up. - No. - 'Cause Mountain Dew will jack you up. Michael drinks it when. he needs to stay awake-- - I have friends that live on it. - Really?. - And I couldn't do it. - Mm-hmm. - I'd be, you'd have to. peel me off the ceiling. So good. - It's incredible, incredible. I can't remember what I was gonna say. - [Theresa] One of the best dishes. So we can eat more? - That half a crescent. just made my mouth mad. Wants to know where the other. half of that crescent are. (laughs) Well y'all, if you've never had it, please try it. You know, surely the. caffeine would cook out of the Mountain Dew. - [Theresa] I was gonna. ask you that question and then I was worried that. that was just a dumb question. - I don't know, but I'll tell you what. - If it jacks me up--. - We'll let 'em know. - So be it. (laughs) - [Theresa] It was worth it. - Oh, love and best dishes, y'all.;['postres']
Ufx8UwMQqzU.json;- Y'all know how much I. love hearing from y'all. I enjoy reading your. notes and your recipes that you send me. I think it's so important. that we not let go of those recipes that our. mothers and grandmothers made for us, that we love so dearly. So it just thrills me, every time I get a note from somebody. out there that says, this is what I've been making. for years and it's so good. Well, what night was it? Saturday night, Michael was at work. I was here by myself, and I wanted something sweet so bad, and I didn't have anything sweet, which is unusual in this house. So, I went in the office and. started going through the mail that I have gotten, from, my, for lack of a better word fans. I like to think of y'all. is friends, myself. And these are, so I ran up on some mail, that, I got right before we packed up to move back in this house. So I just hadn't gotten. around to making it, but I came up on, this note and, the recipe was. melting moments cookies, melting moments cookies. I said that is for me. And I read the ingredients. I said, dad gum, this is so easy. So, Rosemary Brewington, I don't know, I think I. ate six of these cookies. - [Eddie] I mean really the. title describes it perfectly. I mean those things definitely just melt. - They melt in, - [Michael] And you do have a moment. - your mouth. And like I said, I think I ate six of them, Eddie. I was by myself. Nobody was here to count on 'em. (laughing) - [Eddie] Actually, I. was kinda of surprised. I was like, just tell. me, how many did she make cause there was only like three or four under the cake dome this morning. I don't know. - Well, Michael, if I put things out like that with glass and Michael Gruber can see it, and I can see it, it is not hidden too well from us. All right, but here's what she says, Paula, I am 65 years old and. I have been cooking these since I was 12, mainly Southern cooking. And I have been cooking since I was 12, mainly Southern cooking. I have saved all of your recipes to cook something different. God bless you and your family, Rosemary Brewington Atlka, Tennessee. A-T-L-K-A, Atlka. Wouldn't that be pronounced. Attica, Tennessee. So I receive this, the envelope is postmarked August, of 21. So, Rosemary actually sent me, three or four recipes. She sent me a recipe for prune cake. Now I used to have a prune. cake and it was so good. Kind of like the fig cake. And she sent me a frozen. cranberry salad recipe, and, she sent me a recipe for cashew pralines. It sounds awfully good. But the one that caught my eye was these melting moment cookies. Rosemary, your so stinking good. They don't make very many though. (laughing) They melted almost, before anybody could get any. So I want to share Rosemary. Brewington's recipe for melting moments cookies. And when I tell you it's easier, so easy. The other night, when I went to make them, I couldn't believe I. was out of corn starch, but I was, and so I started doing some research, to see what I could. substitute corn starch with. Well, as it turns out, you. can use just plain old flour, but if a recipe calls for two. tablespoons of corn starch, then you, no, if the recipe calls for, yeah,. two teaspoons of corn starch and you gotta substitute with flour you would put four teaspoons of flour, because, corn starch is, more potent, than regular flour. So I did and like I said, I certainly wouldn't throw. them in the trashcan. I thought they were delicious. So, I'm really anxious now to, make a batch using a corn starch. Oh, and I've got something right here. Now Eddie, do we know who sent this? Oh, yeah. Oh oh, got some butter on that. Oh, Joey, that's not her name. Her name is Stephanie Morris. from Henderson, Kentucky. She says, dear Paula, I've so enjoyed watching. your YouTube videos every time you said, no butt shots Eddie. I cracked up and I thought. that saying should be on a tea towel so I made you one. When I lean over to put. something in the oven, I was so afraid Eddie was. gonna take a butt shot, cause' it ain't putting no mower. So Stephanie, this is precious. This is precious. And I love an old flour. sack tea towel so much. No butt shot Eddie. - [Eddie] She did, true of this one, hanging besides the stove in there. There's one more that she did. - And so she did that when Baking Day. - Yeah. - Oh, it's so cute. Bring it in here Teresa. It's hanging on the side of the oven. - Yeah, right there. - [Teresa] Oh, wow. Ain't that adorable. - [Teresa] That is adorable. Stephanie, I used to do,. so today is Baking Day. How about that? - [Teresa] So Baking. Day No Butt Shots Eddie. - And that's my motto for the day. (laughing) Stephanie, this is darling. I used to do things like this years ago, but, oh look, we've got something on it. We've been using it, Stephanie. All right. So let's move on to Rosemary's. melt in your mouth cookies. So I've got, and did I. say thank you, Stephanie. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. I love them, y'all are so sweet out layer. All right, so I've got one cup of butter that's been softened, a fourth of a cup of corn starch. And let's see, I believe that's. a corn starch, right Teresa? - [Teresa] Yes Ma'am. - And a third of a cup of powdered sugar. - [Teresa] would be the other small one. - The fourth, looks larger. than the third, doesn't it? Oh well. - [Teresa] I promise you I measure. - This is the largest one. The third is the largest one. So I may have set it back. Okay, in goes the corn starch. In goes the powdered sugar. And, then Rosemary said. to slowly add the flour. (mixer humming) The other night when I made 'em, Michael burned up my little hand mixer making twice baked potatoes for Christmas. Cause it was so many potatoes, cause we had to fix it for like 40 people. And, it was burned it right on up. - [Eddie] It used to. be used, the egg mixer. - I know, I know, but, working with Michael, I don't know. I don't know if they've. been so easy, to accomplish. All right, so I'm gon' add. a couple of tablespoons of flour at the same time. So, Rosemary, I made them just by the. recipe Saturday night, except for having to. substitute the corn starch. But, I kept thinking, now these, the little drop, the little. frosting that you put in. It's like a thumbprint cookie. Y'all you make your thumb print, then after they come out of the oven, you drop the frosting, in the center. And, I thought, oh my gosh, this would be so good with,. maybe almond flavoring or an orange flavoring. So, I'm not gonna play. around with the cookie because it's just wonderfully, melt in your mouth short made cookie. So, I'm not gon change that but I do think that I'm gon' play. around with the frosting we gon' drop in the center. And so, I'm debating, orange, almond, coconut, I mean, anything that you got. laboring for, you can use. I don't know if I even finished. telling y'all a minute ago that my mixer was burned up by Michael. So I just mix this with, with. my, by hand, with a fork. Cause your butter is so soft, that you can truly just stir it together. All right, so Rosemary said to, drop this by the teaspoon fulls, and that very first one, I didn't, that's not big enough to suit me. So did those look like. the same size again? - [Eddie] Yeah. - So this is my powdered sugar, and, this is what I'm used. to make, the frosting. But right now I'm gon'. use it, to wet my cookies. Because if I didn't use flour or powdered sugar, it would all stick to my hands. So, to me, this is the best way to, get your indention done. See how good that works. There you go. And we gon cook those, in a. 350 preheated degree oven. For I think like 10, I think. she said like 10, yeah, 10 to 12 minutes. And then she told me in. the letter, she said, let 'em cool slightly, but Rosemary, I did not let them cool, because I tried, I put. the frost in one oven and I thought it would spread out, but it didn't, it remained. right there in the center. So, I just went ahead. and frosted them all. Okay, now, since our. cookies bake so quickly, I'm gon go ahead. Teresa is finishing up,. putting them out on the tray and I'm gonna go ahead. and make up our frosting because as soon as I take. those cookies out of the oven, I want to be able to start loading them. All right, I don't think. that's quite a cup. Like I missed a little bit. There you go. So, here's the decision we've got to make. Eddie, we've also got a. lemon flavoring up there, and this is orange. Oh, and it smells so good. Did you smell?. - [Eddie] Yes. - It smells, it's so citrusy smelling. And of course almond,. who doesn't love almond? I love all my almond. So, I was thinking- - [Eddie] You have, peppermint one too. - Peppermint is for Christmas, so I think. I don't like peppermint, too much. - Alright nick calls for three ounces, of cream cheese, and course, I've been cutting off an eighth ounce. Blocks of- Doesn't that look about. three ounces right there? Looks like it to me. Hey, go ahead and just use it all. Cause I don't like to. be short on the frosty. Okay. So, the recipe for the. icing is three ounces of cream cheese, one cup of powdered sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla. So, I'm gonna get this. mixed up right here. So, since I can't make up my mind and y'all are not. offering a lot of hay up. Oh, oh gosh, that's flung everywhere. Oh, since you two ain't. offering any advice. I think I'm gonna separate this in half and do half orange and half almond. What y'all think about that? - [Eddie] Yeah.. - [Teresa] Most definitely. - Yeah, yeah I got a respondence. So, I'm gonna put, a little almond in that one. And just that little bit of. flavoring, moistens it up. Yum. - [Teresa] Let's see how. the orange one turns out. - Admirable. Yes, so now we're gonna try the orange. I just, the orange just sounds like it could be real refreshing. I wish I'd thought of, made a little zest. That's good, It's, and another one that would. have been good y'all is lemon. So, while we're waiting. on our cookies to bake, I'm gonna take this orange, and I'm gonna wash it, and I'm gonna zest it. Rosemary. Now, I don't know what happened girl, but, those that I made Saturday night, they stayed up, and, the little indention stayed down on em. But these didn't. So you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking, that I. might go back to the way I did 'em Saturday. night, just substituting an little extra flour in. place of the corn starch. Cause my indention is gone. And I was just afraid. I was gon' to ruin 'em. So, I made them about. that size the other night. And like I said, when I. pulled them out of the oven, they all had my thumb indention. There was still one left. when he came here wanting it. So this is the orange. And,. - [Teresa] Smells so good. - Then the orange smell delicious. So, did a little, zest. I can't remember what I paid that was. - [Eddie] Jest. - Jest. - Like in Jest, like you. say something in jest. And see, you think that. this frosting would melt, but it doesn't. - [Teresa] Yeah, even on the flat cookie. - I know. So, I can't believe it Rosemary. So, I will make these again. And, so, I don't know what I did wrong. I think with you telling me, that to make an indention in the cookies that you would tell me that because they would come out of the oven, with an indention. So, we shall see. It can't hurt the taste of them at all. They smell so good. So, if you wanna make these, and you don't have any corn starch, and it calls for a third of a cup, a fourth of a cup of corn starch, you would use a half a cup of extra flour. So, it's like the corn starch, didn't, thicken up and out. So, they still good, but I'm gon try making them again. The flavor of these cookies are so good and Rosemary, they did. perfectly, Saturday night for me. And I just increased the flour, because I didn't have any corn starch, which flour is substitute. I mean, you can't even get them off. So I said, there's not many things, that you can't fix, in the kitchen. Look I have buttery. So I took, the cookies that I had made. And like I said, it, you couldn't even get. it up with a, spatular. So I just changed this cookie into a- - [Eddie] A cake pop.. - Cake pop. That's right. Don't try to trick us girls. We can get it done, but I'm certainly gon make. these again, Rosemary. And, I think I'm gon hold off the corn starch and just increase my flour. Just like I did, cause they turned out perfect. - [Eddie] Yeah, you can. get them off the plate, off the cookie sheet with a spatular. But when you go to pick. them up they're so- - Yeah, they crumble. So I'll show y'all what I'm talking about, they're so thin, and look at my hands, if this. is truly a buttery cookie. And you just mash your mouth. together and it's gone. - [Eddie] Yeah, yeah.. - So, - [Eddie] It's a good treat. - So Eddie, since your. hands are not all messed up, I would like for you to. try an orange cake pop. - [Eddie] Cake pop? Butter pop? It's good. - It is good, yeah. I have to say, you can. fix almost anything, but, you can't fix scorched. If you have scorched something, you can put that in the trash, because I don't of, a way. in the world to fix that. So that's my story,. morning glory for the day. Thank you, Rosemary. And I'll, oh my gosh. I love my tea towels. Love, love.;['postres']
ufYUt6zoG3k.json;- I'm so glad y'all. are here with me today. 'Cause you know why? I am gonna share with y'all how I make my homemade ice cream. And I'm telling you, your tongue will slap yo'. your brains out, honey. It is so, so good. So it's really, really. simple to make, y'all. I definitely recommend. using an electric churn. We don't do the crank handle anymore. We go the electric route, but the important thing is you've got to let your ice cream ripen. And when your churn starts laboring, then you know it's ready, and then you need to take your paddle out, drain all the water off, and pack it with lots of. ice and ice cream salt. So we'll get to that. when it's time to pack. But sometimes I do it different ways, but sometimes this is my. standard recipe, y'all, for vanilla ice cream, homemade vanilla. But since it's peach season, we're having, because I've been craving it so bad, we're gonna have peach ice cream. So we're gonna start with four eggs and a little over a tablespoon. maybe of lemon juice, and that lemon juice is gonna. help cook our yolks, our eggs. (blender buzzing) Okay, so let's talk about, and you could buy that egg substitute, or what, pasteurized eggs. that comes in a carton. You can use those. Now, if you wanted, if you don't like the. idea of using raw eggs, you can turn this into a. custard, an ice cream custard. And what would turn this into custard is cooking your base with your eggs in it, along with your milk and heavy cream. So I have no problem with the raw eggs. So I'm gonna do them just raw, but a cooked custard is. wonderful too, y'all. So in fact, when I make my mama's eggnog, she used the raw eggs. and didn't cook anything. But when I make my mama's. eggnog, I do, I cook it. I cook the custard part. So that's just a personal preference, but this is the way we do it, or the way we did it in Albany, Georgia. So I'm gonna add two. cups of sugar to my eggs. And I'm gonna beat that together. (blender buzzing) So I'm gonna add a tablespoon of Madagascar vanilla. Oh, I wish y'all were here to smell it. And now, because we're. making peach ice cream, I'm gonna use about a teaspoon of almond, and that almond flavoring,. y'all, it just brings out, it just brings out the. flavor of those peaches. Those two flavors just go together for me. All right. And I'm just gonna beat this. every time I add an ingredient. (blender buzzing) And Theresa got our freezer canister. She's actually got it in the freezer. So that's really gonna help. That's gonna kinda give us a head start. Okay, look how pretty that is. Talk about rich, homemade. vanilla ice cream. Wow. Now, I'm gonna add a can of. sweetened condensed milk. Look at that. You know if it's got this in. it, it's gonna be delicious. Eddie, have you ever. had homemade ice cream? - [Eddie] I have, yes. - [Paula] When did you have it? - [Eddie] Oh, I mean, I've had it- - [Paula] Since you've been down here, or? - [Eddie] Oh yeah, yeah, I've had it back- - [Paula] Or up North? - [Eddie] Back home, both. - [Paula] Y'all make. homemade ice cream up North? - [Eddie] Sure we do. (Paula laughing) - I didn't know if y'all knew how. You know what? If I'm lived where you lived, I would never, never. make homemade ice cream. Do you know why? - [Eddie] Why? - Because some of the best ice cream I've ever put in my mouth, we had a very crazy fluke winter one time. We were living in Columbus, Georgia, and we got 17 inches of snow, Eddie, and there was a little nanny. that stayed across the street that took care of these two little boys. Their mother had passed away. So I think her name was Eddie May. I'm not sure, but I loved her. And when it snowed, she said,. do you make snow ice cream? I said, no, I've never. Show me how. Well we just went out, and 17 inches of snow, y'all. I mean, I was up to my,. whatever these things, calf. No, not calves. My, above my knee. - [Eddie] Hamhocks. - Yeah, my hamhocks.. (Paula laughs) Yes. Maddy spent the night. with me the other night, and we threw hamhocks. That's when you throw your. legs all over each other. (Paula laughs) And oh, he's such a good cuddler. So anyway, all we did was put. in some vanilla flavoring, and we added one can of. sweetened condensed milk. And I'm telling you what, that was the best scream I'd ever tasted. And all you had to do is. go out and put you some, don't use yellow snow or brown snow. You'd want the real clean,. fluffy, not the hard snow. And it's delicious. So if I lived up North,. Eddie, during the winter, I would be big as the side of a barn 'cause I would have homemade. ice cream every day. - [Eddie] We made it when. we were in Minneapolis. - We did, didn't we? - [Eddie] Yeah, it was snowing like crazy, and we went out and scooped up some snow. - I forgot about that. - [Eddie] It was delicious, yeah. - I can't see snow without. wanting snow ice cream. So anyway, now we just added. our sweetened condensed milk. And to make snow cream, you. don't even have to add sugar because your sweetened. condensed milk makes it sweet. (blender buzzing) Okay. This is so easy to make, y'all. It really and truly is. All right, now I'm gonna. add one 12 ounce can of evaporated milk, evaporated milk, which this is the kind. of milk I like to use when I'm making my macaroni and cheese. Just makes wonderful macaroni and cheese. Now I've got three cups of. fresh peaches over here. Whoops, you get back in there. You ain't running from me. For the three cups of peaches, it really depends on how sweet. and ripe your peaches are. I added 3/4 cup of sugar. It's still a little bit tart. Normally, I will add one cup of sugar to whatever fruit I'm using, whether it's strawberries, pineapple. You may have to cut back a little. Aunt Peggy's favorite ice. cream in the whole world, they used to make all the. time, was pineapple ice cream. They loved it. And banana. And I tell you, another one. that I just loved so much, and that was cherry vanilla. And I would just get. the maraschino cherries, and cut them in half, and mix them in, and I made sure that. my ice cream was white. I liked my ice cream white with my chunks of the. frozen cherries in it. Oh my gosh, you can make chocolate. You can, just about anything. you want, you can make. All right, so now I'm gonna add, this is a cup and a half of heavy cream. So it's gonna be rich, y'all. You're gonna be rich. But if it wasn't rich,. it wouldn't be good. Alright, now we're gonna. add, this is about, this is like a cup and three quarters, but we're actually gonna. be adding more milk, y'all, because we're gonna pour. this into our canister. And then we're gonna. have to continue putting your whole milk in it till. it reaches your fill line on the canister of your ice cream machine. (blender buzzing) Look at that. Okay. Okay, okay!. (Paula laughs) Oh, I'm so excited. Now, for your peaches, some. people like big chunks. I like. I took my little meat cleaver and beat these with my meat cleaver, 'cause I like a chunk now and then, but then I like the kind of mashed up. So I'm gonna taste this and. see what we've got here. Wow. I wanna make sure all my sugar. is incorporated into that. Pow! Pow, cabow. Okay, now I'm gonna add in my peaches. Whoops. And I just wanna stir these because I don't want 'em. torn up a whole bunch, a whole bunch more. So there we go. Oh. Now you can put as many. peaches as you desire. If you like a bunch of. peaches, then add more. And just remember to, just remember to adjust the sugar. All right, where's that little paddle. - [Theresa] Here it is. - Thank you, thank you. - [Theresa] You're very welcome. - Okay, I'm gonna put this down in there, and there's a little niche. There's a little dimple down there that. I said, I wish all bowls. had pour spouts on 'em 'cause I'm kind of afraid. to pick this up and pour it. I don't wanna get it everywhere. Oh my goodness. I'm about to swallow my tongue, and my stomach, and everything else. - [Theresa] Don't do that. - 'Cause that little taste, oh. That little taste just got me to goin'. Okay, let's see if we can. find the fill line on that. Most of 'em have a fill line, Theresa. Like don't fill it past this. - [Theresa] Let me see. - [Paula] But I don't see one. See what you think. - [Theresa] I don't see one. - But usually you can. fill 'em about right there because it's gonna swell. All right, I'm gonna try to finish just pouring it. All right, so we gonna need. just a little bit more milk. Not a whole bunch, but just a little. Okay. You wanna make sure you get. all of that out because that- Theresa, would you- - [Theresa] Sure. - [Paula] Just give me a. hand holding up that bowl. It's so heavy. I wanna make sure I get all. that sugar that hadn't melted. - [Theresa] I know,. they're surprised by that. - Yeah.. (Paula laughs) They are to. Okay, now I just need some whole milk. And we're ready to start freezing. - [Theresa] There's your whole milk. - Thank you. - [Theresa] And here's your ice. - Okay, so about right there. Okay. - [Theresa] You don't have. to fill the whole thing up. Like if your recipe comes. with a little different- - But you know what? I'm gonna do a little bit more. There we go. Now that's a plenty right there. All right, so we need to put our lid, our lid on. Okay. And I think we have to take this off. Some of these machines. may be different, y'all. This is where a husband comes in handy. All right, I'm gonna take that off now so I can put it down in the tub. Husbands always get this part. And I would do the making of the cream. (Paula laughs) And then I would turn. over this churning process to the man of the house. Okay. All right, now we're gonna put, let's see. It tells you, we're making homemade ice cream. The temperature of the. liquid ice cream mixture needs to be lower than 32. degrees so that it will freeze. Works great to create a brine. with a melting thermometer. I was gonna see if I could tell y'all. Let's see, it says surround canister with several inches of crushed ice followed by rock salt using. a ratio of one part salt to eight parts and crushed ice. So as far as I'm concerned, you can't, you can't use too much salt. I guess it could make it. freeze prematurely, but. And you wanna make sure. that you don't get your salt down in that little hole. because our ice cream is there. Okay, here we go. Okay. Oh, you gotta love this ice. Okay. We are looking like professionals here. - [Theresa] I know! I'm impressed. - All right. The last layer of ice cream salt, and then we gonna crank this puppy up. It seems like, it's been a long time since. I've made ice cream, y'all, but it seems like it takes. like 30 minutes to churn. - [Theresa] It says 30, and I think it comes out. more as a soft serve. - Yes. - [Theresa] And then you. can put it in a container and let it harden as hard as you. - Yes, yes, yes. - [Theresa] Or as much as you want. But we're eating it at the soft serve. - Well, the thing is,. you have to let it ripen. - [Theresa] Oh, ripen. - Okay, now. - [Theresa] That's why I. just would make vanilla. - No, you've got to, when it's ready we will take, we will take the- - [Theresa] This in here. - Supposed to be, it snapped. Did it jump out? Okay, thank you. Okay. So I'm gonna show you what. it's gonna sound like. (ice cream machine buzzing) Yay! - [Theresa] I can tell. how excited you are. - Yes, I'm so excited. - [Theresa] Now, Paula, at what point should they check the ice? - Okay, we will, oh, we're gonna keep our eye on it, and we're gonna need. much more ice than that. - Okay. - Because the ice is gonna melt, and then we're gonna make. sure the water is drained off. Because we want it ice not water. And it should have a hole on it somewhere. - Right here. - The drain hole. Where is it? Yes. So we'll pour the melted. part out that hole. And when our ice cream is ready, we're gonna take our motor off and put our top back on after, after we take the paddle out. Because (Paula coughs) excuse me, if you let your ice cream. ripen with a paddle, is so hard to dip. So even though it's a pain in the behind, I like to go ahead and. take that paddle out and then drain my water off,. put more ice, more salt, and cover it. And mama, mama used to. have some floor rugs that had like the rubber backing. And of course they were clean. They were washed. But mama would put up on. after we packed it all down with a proper amount of salt and rice, salt and ice. And then I remember. her putting newspapers, real thick stack of. newspapers on top of that. So you want to keep that. is sealed up as you can, and then keep checking it because it probably needs to. ripen for about two hours. The best I can recall. But let me tell y'all something. It's work every bit of that two hour wait. So it's gonna be a while before. I get back to the ice cream, but I will see ya before this day's over. Okay, y'all, the ice cream. completely quit churning. So, look at this. Now this is my least favorite part, is taking that blade out. And I wanna make sure I. get salt in our ice cream. So here we go. Here we go. Oh, look at it. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Let's see, I don't wanna disturb it. I swear, I don't wanna disturb it. Oh my goodness. I don't know if I can. even get that out, Eddie. I don't think I'm strong enough. Why don't we just pick around the paddle? So this is real important, y'all, that you have that. little plug right there. Now let's find our hole. And it's right here. You can see, I filled. that ice cream churn up just perfect with ice cream, Eddie. 'Cause it swelled to the very top. Ooh, and that is some cold,. cold water coming out of there. So we wanna drain as much. of that water off as we can. Gotta make sure I got the. hole turned the right way. That looks pretty good. So I'm gonna, now, this is. our second box of salt, y'all. Our second box. All right, come on, you little devil. I'm gonna put another. good coat of salt on it. And then this is the second. 10-pound bag of ice, y'all. So you will need 20 pounds of. ice to make your ice cream. Okay. Now some more salt. All right, so I'm gonna reach down in here and get that salted ice. that I had to knock off. Okay. So now we've got that packed real good. And I told you that my mama used a rug with a rubber backing, a clean rug that was rubber backed. So I'm just looking for anything. that I can wrap over this to keep it as cool as we can. And we don't take a newspaper. So I don't even have newspapers. Okay, that's pretty, pretty dadgum good. Okay, I'm still gonna look. for one other something. So, I'll check this in about. an hour and a half maybe, (Paula laughs) but it looks so delicious. I'm just gonna be sorry that. I didn't take the effort to take that paddle out, but that's all right. Here's your spoon. Oh, please, to the ice cream gods. It is so frozen. Oh! My momma and daddy would be so proud. Here, Eddie, get you a spoon. Let's go. Oh, look, look. Gonna slap me now or later? (Paula laughs) - [Eddie] That almond. with the peach is so good. - [Paula] It just makes it, doesn't it? Theresa! - [Theresa] Coming! - [Paula] Grab you a spoon! - [Theresa] I'll bring a spoon! (Paula laughs) Don't eat without me! - That is the hardest homemade. ice cream I've ever had. 'Cause usually, come on. Oh, you got you two spoons. - [Theresa] I brought, oh,. you already have a spoon. - [Paula] Oh, no, I. went and got Eddie one. - [Theresa] Oh, you just. didn't bring me one. - [Paula] No, 'cause I. didn't know you was coming. - [Theresa] Oh. Restart my heart. (Paula laughs) - Eddie, doesn't get as excited over food as like me and Teresa.. (Paula laughs) - [Theresa] Oh my gosh. - You know what? It could- - [Theresa] And that would. be good on pound cake. Oh my gosh. - It could be a tad sweeter. - [Theresa] It could be. Now, I don't like it. overly sweet, to be honest, just because I always eat. it with something else, and the other thing is always sweet too. - Well, normally I sweeten. my fruit with a cup of sugar, but those peaches tasted kind of sweet. So I backed off and just use. like a half a cup, I think. But- - [Theresa] And you could let your peaches sit a little longer. Like we could, like. once you put your sugar- - [Paula] Yeah, yeah. - [Theresa] Like let 'em sit. for 30 minutes to an hour. - But honey, it's been. years since I've made this. - [Theresa] Is it as good as you remember? Eddie, you not gonna try it? - [Eddie] I did. It was good. I love the almond flavor. - I just got a piece of ice cream salt. Sweet and salty, I love it. I know it. Oh, Theresa, you gotta. get a lot more than that. - [Theresa] Oh, that's fabulous. - Y'all, please make you. some homemade ice cream. My favorite, Eddie, still. may just be plain ol' vanilla because I can put my peaches on top of it, or my strawberries, are chocolate syrup, or pineapple, or banana. Can mash up a banana. with some vanilla wafers, and I'll have an ice. cream banana pudding bowl. (Paula laughs) All right, you wanna help. me get to this kitchen with this, Eddie? Ooh, loving best dishes, y'all.;['postres']
uK7Qh2LHp3k.json;[Music] come on in and see this one because this recipe is so intriguing and interesting the two foods that are fixing to collide is sugar and mashed potatoes it doesn't sound logical does it but you're gonna be blown away by the flavor and the taste of these little chocolate eggs and I'm fixing to make for us now I'm gonna take two one-pound boxes of confectioner sugar I have taken mashed potatoes from yesterday and I have added a stick of butter so I'm gonna take these mashed potatoes and I'm gonna work them into our confectioner sugar and I'm just gonna work that in and I'm gonna add about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla flavoring if you wanted a chocolate egg sift about 1/4 of a cup of cocoa powder in with your confectioner sugar you could take candied cherries and chop them up and have a cherry cream filling on the inside of these all right I'm diving in with my hands now y'all and the heat from my hands is gonna break down that buttery mashed potato and you can see how it's already starting to stick together you may find that you need to add a little bit more powdered sugar or a little bit more mashed potato but either way it should come out the consistency of marzipan so see a anyway you go your problems can be remedied so I think I'm gonna make mine very close to the size of a real egg wait so does that kind of look like an egg now you can make almost eggs the size of a jelly bean so now we're just gonna take our eggs and dip them and you can see the ones that have set how much better they dip then the softer ones so I would say to form your Easter eggs into the desired shape and then maybe put them in the refrigerator and let them harden a little bit and then dip them but you can see I have taken just a plain flaked coconut and I've tossed it and a little green food coloring so it looks like the eggs are sitting on grass I love melted chocolate child so instead of getting one of those that set up I'm gonna get this one with the soft chocolate it's delicious you can see the creamy inside [Music];['postres']
UR0kyepZUCM.json;"- Okay, y'all, for this next recipe that I'm gonna share with you is one that my Aunt Glennis, shared with me. She was married to my uncle Bernie, my daddy's oldest brother. And every Thanksgiving until I went into the restaurant business, every Thanksgiving we spent. over there in Statesboro the whole Hiers clan, and. that went on for 25 years. And we have got so many good memories of our times over there. And Aunt Glennis always had. what she called chewies. And as soon as you walked in the door, the first place you'd. go is to the sideboard where all her desserts. were and grab you a chewy. (laughs) So that's what I'm. gonna share with y'all today. I made some the other day. Jamie was saying, ""Wish I had one of Aunt. Glennis's chewies."" I said, ""Well, son, I got the recipe. ""I'll make them for ya."" And so I made them, (laughs) and after he ate one, he said, ""Mama, I so appreciate you doing that. ""They weren't as good as Aunt Glennis's."" I said, ""Well, you know. memories are always better ""than actuality."" (laughs) So now the first thing we're gonna do is we are gonna beat our eggs and our butter together. And that's one stick of butter But I agreed with Jamie. I thought Aunt Glennis's. was better than mine also. So there we go with our three eggs. And we just gonna beat that up until it's incorporated real good. And then we're gonna add our. two cups of self-rising flour. Now that's self-rising, so don't get confused. The flour that I'm putting in here, it already contains. baking powder and salt. If you're using plain flour, you would have to add. either some baking soda or baking powder, but we. don't have to with this one. (beater trills) Now our sweetener is gonna. come from our brown sugar, We're gonna use the whole. box of light brown sugar. And I wouldn't hesitate,. if you have dark brown, I wouldn't hesitate to use that. In fact, you don't have. any kind of sugars at all, dark sugars, you can make your own light brown or dark brown. sugar just adding some molasses to some regular white sugar. So you got your brown sugar just in case you don't. have any in your pantry. All right, now we're. slowly gonna add our flour. And remember, that's two. cups of self-rising flour. Okay, so I'm gonna add a. tablespoon of vanilla,. And now, you know I love nuts. I love nuts in anything. that I eat that's sweet. So the recipe calls for like, what is it, two cups and nuts, Teresa. - [Teresa] Yes, ma'am. - So I'm definitely gonna. put the two cups nuts. Whoa, that's a nutty stuff. All right, now, Aunt Glennis,. she used a small package of semi-sweet chocolates,. and I'm sure it was maybe just a six ounce bag. that she put in there. And this is 10 ounce. I don't even know if they. make that small bag anymore. So I'm just gonna use like half a bag. Even when I make my chunk chocolate chip (indistinct) cookies, I don't use a whole bunch. of chocolate chips in them, because my favorite part in. those cookies is the nuts. And I'm using the little. miniature chocolate chips. So, it's strictly a preference. Like I said, that's not. my favorite ingredient in these chewies. So I'm just using less. And it also calls for 3/4. of a cup of grated coconut, if you like coconut. Well, I normally don't do. it, because I think it's Kari out of the children in the. family that doesn't like coconut. But today I'm gonna put some coconut in it just for giggles. It's gonna kind of taste like a candy bar with almonds in it, I mean, with coconut in it. Y'all know what I'm talking now. Okay, so we're gonna bake. this off in a 13 by 9 by 2. And we have got our oven. preheated at 375 degrees. And we're going to bake. it for about, let's see. I can't remember exactly. how long, 25 to 30 minutes. (oil spritzes) That was some runaway coconut. All right, so I'm gonna. scoop it up this way, because that bowl is so heavy to pick up. Aunt Jessie and Uncle Bernie, they've been gone now for a good while, but I thank them so much for all the wonderful memories. We'd go over there. Uncle Bernie had a pond. I know one year there. were so many of us coming, he had to rent like, oh, darn, I can't remember. what you call them now, like those travel trailers. - An RV?. - Yeah, something like that. He had to rent a couple. of them to hold us all. Oh, and did we ever have fun. Lord have mercy. My cousin, Don, Don Hiers, it was a crazy time in Don's life. So he was actually able to come just maybe two or three times. over those 25 years. And I wish he had been there, 'cause he's got such a good memory. And he could remind me (laughs) of how much fun I had. (laughs) We'd play poker, go outside and play games. And Uncle Bernie would cook a whole hog. He'd build a hole in the ground. He'd cook a whole pig. And he arranged for us to have horses. A friend had horses. So he got them to bring horses. So there was just, ugh, so much to do. But the most that we ever did. there was play poker. (laughs) And the family looked so forward to those little friendly games of poker. And I think we played for a. nickel, dime, and a quarter. And it's amazing how quickly. that can add up. (laughs) All right, in the oven,. 25 to 30 minutes on 375. (timer rings) Perfect, they're ready. (laughs) You know what? I'm gonna take some of these to Jamie and see what he says about this round, because the ones that I took him, I didn't put coconut in them. Like I said, so many folks. are just funny about coconut, but it's really, really good in there if you like chocolate and coconut kind of chewy gooey thing. But my favorite is the end and the corner pieces that are real chewy like this piece. Brings back so many memories. Mm. If you hadn't made these, and this recipe has been around so long, and I'm sure at this point,. everybody's made them before, but in case you haven't... I hear Mikey coming home. One more thing to tempt him. with on his keto diet. (laughs) So if you've never made them,. make sure you do try it, because they're delicious. (laughs) He just stuck his tongue out at me coming through that glass door. Hey, monkey. Would you like a chewy? (Paula laughs) - [Mike] Can I smell one? - Isn't that mean? Yes, you can smell them. - Yuck. (laughs) Love and best dishes, y'all. Now only a devil would. do that to somebody. Well, they say I was born. full of devil anyway. So there you go.

uwr28AaH_cQ.json;- Hi y'all, I've got one. more little recipe to share with y'all that is really. celebrates Halloween and I'm going to make some ghost. And I've started by melting. 1/2 a stick of butter in this pan and when that melts, I'm. gonna, and Oh gosh, 10 ounces. This about 10 ounces. It's been opened, it started at 16, but now. it's probably around 10, maybe taking just a few more out. That should be about 10 ounces. And we're just going to stir that together until we melt those marshmallows. And let's see what else we're gonna do. We're gonna add vanilla flavoring. And these are really like. our Rice Krispie treats y'all but the only thing we're. gonna do different is, since it's Halloween, we have some coarsely chopped candy corns and we're going to stir that. into our Rice Krispie treats. So let's step back here. Let's see how that butter's going. And it's melting on down. So I'm going to go ahead. and pour our marshmallows. And I would really recommend, when you're melting your marshmallows, to go in and get the little bitty ones cause they'll melt a. lot faster and easier. So this one of those things. that you're gonna wanna, you gonna wanna keep a close eye on and stir, stir, stir. Mix, mix, mix. (Paula laughing) I'll never forget Bobby dressing. up like me for Halloween. And he said, mix, mix, mix. All right y'all, our. marshmallows are almost melted. So I just added a fourth. of a teaspoon of salt. And then I'm gonna add. a teaspoon of vanilla. As soon as these marshmallows get down a little bit more meltidy. Doesn't that look wonderful? It reminds me of divinity. Put some coconut on that and it would look like snowflakes. In fact, I think in the end, I think I'm gonna put some coconut on our little ghost. A Halloween ghost. I made this recipe years and years ago when I was shooting up in Millbrook, New York. at Gordon Elliot's house. And when we got through, we had all of our little. ghost standing up. a red food coloring does not. come off of your skin y'all. FYI. And I just thought they were the cutest, cutest little things. (spoon scrapping pot) Okay. We've about got it. Got it all melted. (spoon scrapping pot) It's close enough for government work. (spoon scrapping pot) Okay. So we can bring this over here and I got a hundred thousand. recipes running around in my head y'all. All right on to okay, remove from heat and fold in. the cereal and candy corns. And I'm putting in six,. six cups of, you know, that Snap, Crackle and Pop. (Paula laughing) And these are our coarsely. chopped candy corns. They've gotten gooey. Come on. We're not leaving one of y'all behind. Alright. I'm going to. stir that all together. And I've got some ghost cookie cutters. And it has probably been 14 or 15 years since I shot that show. And I was thinking that we. did our little ghost per hand. I don't recall us using cookie cutters. But so I might wind up spraying these out on our cookie sheet and try to do it with a cookie cutter. It would be less messy for sure. All right. That looks pretty good. I just love Krispie,. Krispie, Krispie treats. All right. So, it's stickery. So I'm just going to pour this out on a grease cookie sheet. You know what? I should have used a big one. I didn't realize it was. going to make that look so, I'm gonna reach in here and. grab a little bigger one cause I don't, thank you Eddie, because I don't want them. necessarily that thick. Oh, and I forgot to tell you. If you do touch these, make sure you spray your hands. And you have to do this. fairly quickly y'all cause it, soon as you. take it off the heat, it starts cooling down very, very fast. Oh, look, that looks like. spider webs, doesn't it? (Paula and Eddie laughing) I forgot to spray the other hand. (Paula and woman laughing) You know, I don't know about y'all but it's actually getting late in the day. And my, I think my brain slows down after, the bewitching hour. Okay. I think I'm going to go like that for 'em. Okay. All right. I'm going to see, just like I said, I can't. remember if we did these by hand, or used a cookie cutter. I just can't remember. (Paula spraying hand) You know what? I'm going to say that we used a cookie cutter, (Eddie and Paula laughing) but I do wanna make sure. Just tell you, I'll make sure that you spray your cookie cutter so that the the ghost won't. stick to your cutters. Okay. I'm trying to pack. this down as hard as I can. (Paula patting down the mix) Cause I don't want it to be loosey goosey. I want him to be whole. Okay so I'm just bringing those edges up. (Paula patting down the mix) Okay. And after these cool for a while, go melt some white chocolate y'all, and frost the ghost in. the white chocolate. And then we're going to. sprinkle a little coconut, shred a coconut on them so they look real spooky. So, let's stick this in the fridge and wave our magic wand Eddie. So earlier kids, we mixed up the ingredients. to make our ghost and we had to put it in the refrigerator and let it get hard. And then look at our little ghost, how cute are th, these. glasses are too big. So I just want to show you what we did. We had our little ghost cookie cutter. And we just beared down real hard And look how this works out. I can legally eat the edges. - [Eddie] There's extra. - [Paula] So that's how. you do it. He's uh oh! - [Eddie] Man over. - This ghost is very tired. Okay. And we just have to push him out. I meant to spray this. cookie cutter and I forgot. Oh, another one bites the dust. (Paula laughs) So you have to, you have. to mold these ghost, like mold their bottoms, so it's perfectly even. for them to stand on. Look at these. Yes. It's so good. Eddie, to race you on a bike is so good. Alright. Oh, his arm fell off. - [Woman Speaking] Uh oh! - Hey, what mixed together real good. That's okay. After I finish with. him, I'll eat him first. All right. We still got another step now, to make our ghost really ghost looking. So I've got white chocolate chips and I'm going to melt. them in the microwave and you want to be real careful, like, don't set it for two or. three minutes and walk off. I'm going to set this about 30 seconds. It may not have gone up, stir it at every turn. Every 30 seconds, I will stir. our white chocolate chips. Okay. So we got our white. chocolate chips, melted, so now I'm just, icing our little ghost, and you could ice both. sides if you wanted to, but I think one side is plenty and then we're going to. dip them down in the, in the coconut. Look how cute! Alright, now we've got. one more thing to do. We've got to make the ghost eyes, and then we got to give. him a nice big smile. The smile is so big it ran into his eye. Look how cute. - [Eddie] That's great. - Isn't that cute? So get in the kitchen and help. your mommy make these ghosts. And not only are they. cute and fun to make, (munches ghost cookie) they're delicious to eat. Happy Halloween!;['postres']
UZQmAnU4u1E.json;"- Hey y'all, I'm Jamie. Deen here at mama's kitchen bringing you easy, delicious. recipes again today. Woo! Call the family. Strawberry shortcake. We're gonna layer it up and add some stuff you ain't never heard before. It's delicious and perfect. for the summertime, could not be more simple either. I went to the store, I. bought a angel food cake. I'm gonna put him on his side, and using a serrated knife, a bread knife, or my mom has this watermelon knife here, you want it serrated 'cause we have to go through here gently. You don't wanna smash this up. We need three rings, so we're gonna divide it into thirds, and this is where the serration comes in 'cause we don't want to lose. our beautiful cake here. And if you try to use a chef's knife, you're not gonna have a whole lot of luck. The good news is, all of. this is gonna be covered up. So we just wanna be as gentle. as we can in this first part. Three rings. One, tow, three. It is really sticky. I don't wanna take a break yet. We're gonna mix cool whip. 12 ounces of cool whip. I'm gonna leave a few ounces in here, 'cause this one's over. We've got our condensed milk, sweetened condensed milk. Yum! Any questions so far? Whipped cream, sweetened condensed milk. Who's with me? (knife clatters) How about let's do some cream cheese? You know what Theresa and I were talking before we got started. here, and Theresa said, ""Oh no, you're gonna need. to take a break here."" And I said, no, I'm not gonna. need to take a break here. This will take about seven minutes. Now here I am one minute in, my hands are dirty and I. can't open my cream cheese. Help me wash my hands. I'll be right back. (hand mixer buzzing) Okay, y'all will be happy to know that I was able to get. my cream cheese open. (hand mixer clinking) Our cream cheese, our. sweetened condensed milk, and our whip topping. Oh, who is with me? Okay, we're gonna build. this in a clear bowl. So first I'm gonna move. this so you can see. I'm gonna put our first layer down there. Now the first thing that's. gonna go on here y'all, there's an ingredient here that I did not make on. screen for you today, but I'm gonna share it with you 'cause it really took time to cool down. This is our, the gelatin. that we have here. I'm gonna tell you exactly what this is. This is the corn starch,. the strawberry gelatin, and the sugar that we've cooked together with a little bit of water. So when you add your corn. starch to the gelatin, it's three tablespoons. Y'all add it very slowly,. 'cause it can clump up on you if you're not very careful. So make sure you whip it up. Now, this is our gelatin mixture. that is completely cooled, and I'm gonna fold our. strawberries into it. I'm gonna save some back, 'cause I know I'm gonna. wanna decorate the top. So our gelatin is very, very, very thick. Now full of these strawberries, this is going on first. (bowl thuds). (bowl scrapes) I love all kinds of layered desserts. We used to do so many parfaits. and things at the restaurant. We would make a cake, and if it wasn't the most. beautiful thing in the world, we could always break. it up and make a trifle. Don't ever throw away something that you don't think is pretty, 'cause you could always repurpose it. So I'm gonna spread our. little bit of this gelatin with our fresh strawberries here. I tell you who the star. of the show is though, and that's our filling over here. Lulu's excited. She wants some.. - Oh, I thought you were gonna say she's. the star of the show. - [Jamie] No, the star. of the show is this, the sweet condensed milk. (hand mixer clinking) Oh! (hand mixer clinking) The whip topping in our cream cheese. Super, duper delicious here. We're gonna put this. right along the outside 'cause I want it to be pretty. (Lulu barks). I'll go all the way around, spread this out. Remember now, this is gonna be covered. (Lulu barks). So I like to cheat towards the sides because that's what you're gonna see. I don't wanna cover the. whole edge of this cake 'cause I wanna see that too. So I'm kinda building towards the outside so we can see it in this glass bowl. Little bit, it's gonna run in the entire (indistinct).. (Lulu barks) It's okay too. All right. (bowl clatters) Second layer. (Lulu barks) (spoon clatters) Now for this, I'm gonna use all the rest. of my gelatin on this layer 'cause I'm not gonna put it on the top. This is the filling, but this is going in one and two. - [Theresa] You could almost. double that recipe filling, or further that. - [Jamie] This is a really. large bowl that Bob has here that we're using today. So if you have a smaller container, yeah, you could double it, triple it. - [Theresa] Yeah, if. you wanted more fruit. (bowl clatters) - [Jamie] Oh my gosh, now here we go. This is where it's gonna get... Yes sir!. - Heavenly. - [Jamie] I gotta tell y'all, Theresa called the beaters. before I even got done with it. (bowl thuds). (Theresa laughs) So we don't - [Theresa] Well Brooke's not here, so - Yeah.. (bowl thuds) We don't just work here. We're customers as well. We love to eat all this food. All right, let's hold a little bit back. (bowl thuds) Right on the top. Golly! Look at that. Wow!. - Yum! Look how pretty. - [Jamie] I didn't. count on angel food cake being so sticky on my fingers now. I hope I left myself enough. (bowl thuds) Go around the top here really good. - [Theresa] You might have. to steal from my beaters. (bowl thuds) - Yeah, you might be outta luck today. No, I'm okay with this 'cause it's such a pretty cake. (bowl thuds) I don't want it to look like. a giant bowl of white cream. So let me see that red, let. me see the angel food cake. I don't wanna cover it all. Just kinda building it up, building it up. That looks pretty (indistinct) good. (bowl clatters) So with our last strawberries. that we have in reserve we're gonna put them around the top. Okay y'all, and once I finish it with my fresh strawberries here. Woo! Woo! How about that? The line starts behind Theresa, but thanks for tuning in today, y'all. I tell you what, if you take one recipe away. from anything that I do, I'd invite you to try this one. It's delicious, perfect time of the year, summertime and the eating is easy. I appreciate y'all tuning in today. I'm Jamie Deen and that's a good cake. We'll see y'all around the kitchen.";['postres']

V6x3wKsSPL8.json;"- You know, I really enjoy. cooking out of my magazine. Uh, my girls cook out of this a lot. And when I'm talking about my girls, I'm talking about my niece Carrie and my daughter-in-law Brew. She cooks out of this magazine a lot. And Claudia and Michelle. and Ashley a Little bit. They um, enjoy uh, pulling. recipes from these magazines. Well, in this months SIP, special issue, a recipe that is near and. dear to my heart cropped up and I said, ""Oh my gosh,. Teresa that sounds like uh, our gooey butter cake almost."" And she said, ""Yeah."" So when we formulated. this recipe we certainly, of course I can't. remember everything y'all, but we certainly must've. had that gooey butter cake in the back of our mind. But this is called a brown blondie with a warm vanilla uh, sauce. A caramel sauce. So we are gonna, let me give you the measurements just in case you um, have. a hard time finding them. It's one cup of packed light brown sugar, one cup of heavy cream,. heavy whipping cream and uh, a fourth of a cup. of unsalted butter cubed and a fourth of a teaspoon of salt. So, let me throw the salt in. And when it gets through cooking, we'll put the vanilla flavoring in there. We gon' put like a cup and. a half of vanilla flavoring. - [Theresa] A cup and a half? (indistinct). - (laughing) I was just top up vanilla flavoring ya'll. - [Eddie] That sounds like a vodka drink. - Sounds like a vodka drink. A teaspoon and a half.. - [Theresa] (indistinct) that's even too much. - A teaspoon and a half y'all, of vanilla. So what we've got here y'all is a caramel sauce because we've used the brown sugar. Now we're going to bring. this sauce to a boil and I've got it over,. like a medium high heat. We're gon' let that come to a boil. And then we gon' lower. our temperature on this. And we gon' to let it. cook for about 10 minutes. And you're gonna need to let this sit for about 30 minutes before you stir it. So we're actually starting. with the sauce first and then we gon' come over here and we're going to make the, the uh, the brownie part, the pecan blondie. I love blondies. So here we go. Let me see if there's any more in there. A little bit, you know, when you're using whipping cream, you think you got it all, but you can always get another drop out. Have y'all ever noticed? You can always get one more drop. So anyway, the teaspoon. and a half of vanilla, we're going to put that. in after this is cooked. Because if you cook, let the. vanilla flavoring cook in you're gon' lose a lot of its punch. So we don't want to, we don't wanna boil that vanilla but we sure do wanna have it handy. And um, this is some homemade vanilla I've told y'all I know. probably several times this is, this is just makes the nicest gift. You just get your vanilla. beans at the grocery store and slice them and then take. your paring knife and just, just skim down that bean. and get all of that dark gooey substance out of the. middle and put it in your your bottle, whatever bottle you decide. But this is a perpetual vanilla that, gosh somebody sent me a. long time ago and you know, you got the bottle and you got the beans but then you have to actually. get your vanilla started. But you know, for it to be really good it needs to sit for a couple of months, at least six weeks y'all. Okay, so this is coming to a boil Mm, and this is gonna be so good. I wonder if I can find y'all a picture. I can't remember if this recipe has a picture with it or not. - [Theresa] I think. they all have pictures. Let me look and see if. I can find one for you. - Let's see what page is that on? Let's see. It's on page 92. Oh, look how beautiful. coconut rice pudding. I'm gon' make some rice. pudding one day for everybody. - [Theresa] Yum. - Mm-mm. There it is. (laughing) Pecan Blondies, with Vanilla Caramel. Now that's up to you, but you can always put a big ol' scoop of Blue. Bell Homemade Vanilla. It's the best vanilla ice. cream I've eaten, ever. Besides homemade, it's the best. All right, it's boiling, isn't Eddie? - [Eddie] Looks good. - [Paula] Mm-mm, it's. going to be delicious. - [Eddie] I kind of. want a caramel cake now. - [Paula] You want a. caramel cake? (laughing) Well, let's make one. - [Eddie] Sounds good. - I can make a caramel cake too. I mean, I could eat a caramel cake too. They're a little tedious to. make Eddie, caramel cakes. Okay, I'm gon turn that down a little bit. And for 10 minutes, we're. going to let this cook. Okay, great Theresa. I appreciate you doing that. - Now, do I keep it boiling. - Well, I cut it down so. the iron is still hot. - The timer 10 minutes. so I don't burn this. - Mm, wow. - Yum. - That caramel sauce is. gonna be so delicious. So delicious, all right. Now the reason I like. this blondie is because, you don't have to pull out. any kind of electric mixer. We're just going to stir all this together and we're going to start. with our brown sugar and then we're going to add our eggs. And we're just gonna whisk those eggs in with that brown sugar. And then, I don't know why this. recipe is making me giggle. I guess 'cause I know what's coming. All right, one cup of melted butter. I guess it's my love of butter. that makes me want to giggle. Oh my gosh it's so good. Is that unsalted butter Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Oh, it's so nasty. - [Theresa] I know, but I. had some in my refrigerator So I figured I'd use it up. 'Cause we don't waste not, what not.. - I appreciate. That's right. You know, all of my recipes. call for unsalted butter. Listen, I don't use unsalted butter. If I'm making a cake I'm. going to use salted butter because I like the salt and the sweet. Uh, unsalted butter does. not even taste like butter, not a drop. So, since this is my party and. I can cry if I want to, I'ma put some salt in there. Okey-dokey. So we're just gonna beat in our vanilla. And then we'll get a wooden. spoon to do that with. And I'm gonna put in two. teaspoons of vanilla. Now over there we're using homemade and over here I'm using store bought. - [Theresa] Well, you can have. the homemade if you want it. - Oh no, this okay. This is okay. And I can't remember Theresa. was that plain flour or? - [Theresa] Yes ma'am. - Okay. So this is not gon' rise up too big. Oh, I love recipes that I don't. have to pull out any mixers. And that was walnuts that I put in there. I wanna get every bit of that off that. So you use unsalted. butter at home, Theresa? - [Theresa] No, I don't. know why I bought it. I bought it by mistake because, so I was trying to slide it in on you but apparently that didn't work. - I'm telling you, I kind of know my boys. Okay, so now all you have to do is um, taking a piece of parchment paper, lining it within a nine inch square pan. And you want, you want, you want to have some. excess parchment paper because when it gets done we're gonna take the parchment paper and lift it out. So that's why the paper is so big. This is good oh, I smell that vanilla. Thank you Eddie. It's kind of a (indistinct) work with but we'll be happy when. we go to take it out that we have gone through the trouble of using parchment paper. I mean, you can have this. dessert ready in no time. And the fact that you've. got vanilla ice cream in your freezer. - [Theresa] And you. could buy caramel sauce if you didn't want to go through the trouble of making it.. - Yeah you could, but why? - [Theresa] I know, 'cause it smells fabulous.. - Because a homemade uh-huh. A homemade caramel sauce so much better. And lasts too long. And it's so easy to make. - [Theresa] She's scraping that. bowl right down to the end. She doesn't even leave. us a tiny bit of dough. (laughing) Not a drip or a drop. - There might be one. little pinch right there. Okay. Let me just spread this out. 'cause it's a very thick, it's a very thick batter. But we can do this thing. Okay, so we're going to. put this in the oven. We've got it preheated. at 350 degrees y'all. And um, I'ma have to. refer back to the recipe 'cause I can't remember. how long, that a typical-- - 25 to 30 minutes. - 25 to 30 minutes,. that sounds about right because a regular gooey butter cake, we'd cook it 35 to 40 minutes. - And they've said you do want it to have a little bit of a few. moist crumbs when we, - Yeah. Ooh, this is gon' be delicious uh. All right, can I borrow your um, timer? It's only been five minutes. - No, it's been a little longer than that. You should have used that. - Oh, I don't know how you use that. - Oh no, no. - I'm going to go to college for that. - You know, you just use 314 and you say I'll wait until it turns to 18 in almost four more minutes. - Okay, so what'd that say? 30 minutes? - Yes, 30 to 35. - Okay, well I'll put it on 32. - No, I'm sorry. 25 to 30. Let's not overcook this. - 25 to 30 okay make up your mind. All right I'll put it on 28. So, such an easy recipe y'all. I hope you got all the measurements down. Because if you're having company over, it will be a,. - And again, the recipe will be attached.. - It'll be a desert to impress. - And the recipe will be. attached to the video. - Good, there's a link right? - Always. - I wouldn't leave y'all on hanging. Okay. So 28 to 30 minutes. And you don't have to stir. it constantly Theresa, it just said frequently. - [Theresa] Okay. You know I follow directions. - I know you do girl. When Eddie was traveling somewhere he came back with some. little gifts for me. Look at this precious little wooden spoon. I love it. Where did you find it, Eddie? - [Eddie] You know, I think they're they're handmade up in. Goffstown, New Hampshire. - Oh my gosh, I love them. - [Eddie] I have a favorite little store up there that I go to. - Look, see the concentrated vanilla bean that was in the lid of. that from me shaking it. So, that is definitely going in the pot. So it's been 10 minutes and I'm going to do. something I shouldn't do. And that's, I'm going to. measure it over the pot. 'Cause if I slipped up, I. could ruin everything right now but I'm gon' try not to slip up. Okay, so I cut the iron off, but you know, these inductions these can stay hot for a long while. So we're going to let. that sit for 30 minutes. Look at that, how beautiful. How beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful. Uh, y'all it's time. for the good stuff now. No more salads, no more low calorie stuff. It's time for our blonde, blonde (chuckles) brownies (chuckles) with a caramel sauce. So look at this. See that's why we put a. parchment paper in there so we could just lift. it right out of the pan. And I'm probably going to get. nine servings out of these. I don't know, I actually could. get more than that Eddie. I think I'm gon' cut it smaller than that. Yeah, I'm gon' get us a few more servings. Okay. Now I would cut this more generous if I was serving someone a dessert but this is going to be. very, very, very rich. And I want you to look. at my ice cream scoop. A friend that watches. my show sent this to me. I love it so much. Uh, I'll never use another ice cream scoop other than this one. You see the handles are filled. with some type of liquid. And I just put this ooh, under the hot water and let it sit. And it will help you get that ice cream out of there so much easier. You know, I mean, it's still gon' be work. Still going to be a little. work, but you know what? So worth it. All right. How about if I do this bigger piece? And look at that. Now you don't want to over cook this. You want it to be a little,. little gooey, just like that. Kind of like the gooey butter cakes. All right so there we go. Look that, that scooper is so hot, it was melting the ice cream. Okay. That got oh, Theresa. off the sofa. (laughing) Look at here at this. caramel sauce, would you? Look at that. - [Theresa] 10 minutes. - That's almost pure porn. It's food porn. - [Theresa] Exactly. - Whoa, give it your best shot Pau. Oh, oh, (giggles) oh. Well I thought we could. just taste this one and then I'll fix another. How about that? Eddie? Come on over here Therese. - [Eddie] I'll wait. - [Paula] Huh, what? You'll wait? - [Theresa] You'll wait? - [Paula] Here Therese. - [Theresa] When have I. ever heard you say that you'll wait on something sweet? - [Paula] Okay. Get you some. Oh gosh, look at that. - [Theresa] I can't get over how easy that caramel sauce is to make. Oh my gosh. - We need to go to church sister. - [Theresa] Mm-hm. I'll eat the front end. You eat the back end. - [Paula] I'd eat that back end any day. - [Theresa] Eddie, it is a sin. - Yeah, we are sinning. We need to go to church y'all. - [Theresa] I have no words. No, no words. I'll just dig back in, how about that? Oh my gosh, so good. You have to try this too. We have to wrap this up. so Eddie can have a piece. - I wanted you to see the look on her face when she was eating it. So can you do it again Theresa, without me talking? - It's not that hard. (laughing) It is so good. - I tell you what, you couldn't go to a bakery, and buy anything close to this. - [Theresa] 30 minutes. - Mm-hm. Please make the recipe y'all. Which magazine is it in? - Special Interest Piece. - Yeah, it's on the stand. right now, isn't it? - [Theresa] It's on the stand right now. - Come on Theresa. you're letting me get ahead.. - [Theresa] I ate my whole piece. You just end this. - No, Uh-uh. - [Theresa] Uh-huh. - Loving best dishes y'all.";['postres']
v7lrvJizpN8.json;- There is certain candies. or cookie-like things that you have to have at Christmas. You know that Theresa, don't you? - [Theresa] Mm hmm. - And my cousin, Don, well, before COVID. Now this will be the first Christmas that we're going to celebrate, like a normal Christmas, in two year, two Christmases. Has it been, I know last year, you know, I didn't see or do anything, but Christmas is going. to be as close to normal as I can get it this year. And cousin Don and his wife, Darlene, would always come spend Christmas with us and stay two or three weeks. Well, they're coming again and Don's going to be here on Friday and they have bought them a RV (laughs) So my cousin is somewhere out on the highway driving this RV. And let me go ahead and apologize for him because he'll stop, stop, stop, stop, go. (laughs) That would be my cousin out there. If you see something like that going on in an RV. But he's going to get here Friday and I'm going to work. his little fanny off. I'm going to have him shooting. some old videos with me and just busy, busy in this kitchen. So I can't wait for them to get here. And he always makes this. crack candy every Christmas. - [Theresa] So, see,. you'll have some for him when he gets here. - Yes, I will have some. ready for him to eat and he'll be most proud. So, you know, this, and I'm sure you probably had this recipe at some point because it's so dadgum easy. I want it to be called redneck candy. (laughs) Shouldn't it? - [Theresa] It's so good. - It is so, so good. I'm going to start with. two sticks of butter, getting those melted. And the base to our cookie candy. You know, to me it's not a cookie and it's not really a candy, it's kind of a candy cookie. - [Theresa] Anything with (indistinct). - Yeah, you know, kind of. - [Theresa] It's kind of. like a toffee, really . - Yes, kind of, well, it's got toffee in it. So, first you start with saltine crackers which makes for such an easy, easy cookie. And we're going to use. one and a half sleeves. I'm going to take out the broken ones and we're using a parchment paper. Now, if you don't, if you don't want to use parchment paper, you don't have to, you would just want to. spray your pan real good and go line up our saltines just like this. Like I said, I'm taking. out the broken ones. - [Theresa] I'm going. to turn on the stove, if that's okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can start that melting. Yeah, so we really don't. want to cook anything. Once we add the brown sugar, Theresa, just needs to kind of cook for about three minutes. Is that mounted enough? - That's up to you. - All right, yeah. As long as we can mix that brown sugar in with it. So I'm gonna add these. crackers back to that sleeve because that'll be wonderful on top of it. I think, didn't Michael. make some split pea soup. He'd love that on top of the soup he made. Okay, so. - It's almost melted. - Yeah we're going to let that cook for just a few minutes. Let me see what you, you turned it down, didn't you? Or did you turn it up? Anyway, that's good. So, over here, we have one cup of milk chocolate. We have one cup of tiny more so semi-sweet chocolate. And then we've got a cup of toffee. And you find this in your baking section. And this toffee also comes within a chocolate coated toffee. And if that's all you can find, that's fine to use, it really doesn't matter. All righty, Theresa. - [Theresa] I'm going. to let you take over. - Thank you, thank you. - [Theresa] I just didn't want it to burn. - I don't want it to burn either. So, those of you out, out in, what would that be called? Cyber land? Or computer land? How would we refer to our friends that we can't meet face to face yet? Social media land? - [Theresa] Video world? - Yeah, video world. I knew I was looking for. something like that, Theresa, and I knew you'd come up with it. If y'all have never made this and you make another kind of candy, share the recipe with me because I have so much fun sharing. People out there in social media land, when y'all send me your recipes. - [Theresa] We've gotten amazing recipes. - I know, I know. - [Theresa] It's crazy. - And it's just wonderful when y'all share with us. People enjoy those. - [Theresa] Well candy. is such a great thing because it can be a gift. - Yes. - [Theresa] A giftable. - Absolutely - [Theresa] You can take. it to a cookie swap. - Uh huh, yeah a cookie swap or just anybody, your Sunday school teacher, the children's teacher, it just makes a nice little gift. And you can go out and find, go to yard sales, and find some pretty jars and put a ribbon on those and decorate them up. And so they have something. they can keep too. Okay. This just looks delicious. You know, my mother, always made divinity at Christmas time, always. And she made the most delicious, beautiful divinity that I've ever seen. And, you know, I've got mama's recipe, but I just, they'll never come out like mama's. Hers looked like an ice, a perfect ice-cream cone topping. And so, so good. I may try making some divinity, this, this Christmas, Eddy. - [Eddy] You've never done that. - You know, it takes two people, it takes two people, because you have to pour that hot syrup very, very slowly into a fine stream. And then once your divinity gets ready, it'll lose it's shine that quick. And you have dip, dip, dip. Okay, this has got a light boil to it. Let me see. Can you get down in there, Eddy? Can you, can you see in that pot? Yeah. So after it starts boiling, you want to let it boil for about three minutes. Just make sure everything is incorporated well. Okay, I think it's been. about three minutes, I bet you, Eddy, since it first started boiling. Turn that off. Oh, and you know what we need to do? I need to heat the oven. Preheat the oven. All right, so, I'm just using a ladle because it'll give me a. little bit more control over where my hot syrup is going. - [Eddy] You know what I discovered, I think you got a little leak in that now. We're going to have to plug, plug that. - What? - [Eddy] Your ladle. - No. - [Eddy] I think the tin has worn out in a section. - No. - [Eddy] Yeah. - No, that can't be, that can't be. Oh, I bought this, Eddy, I'm sure, from a yard sale and I just adore it. All right, now I'm going, I'm just going to take my spoon and spread that hot syrup over everything. Just like that. Oh, that syrup is very, very hot. So handle that with care, y'all. You want to do this kind of gently because it will move your crackers around. Now I thought you were telling me I had a hole in this pan and I was going to say oh my gosh, that's awful. - [Eddy] No, when I was. washing it the other night, I had filled it up with water because I think there. was pea soup in there. - Yeah. (laughs) - [Eddy] And I, when I was holding it up, water was, like, squirting out of that. - Oh no, no. Okay, that's pretty well distributed. Looks pretty good to me. All right, so we're going to put. this in the oven, y'all, 350 preheated, 350. And we're going to let it cook for three to five minutes. So it's been maybe four minutes and it looks like our. oven might be working. I hope, I hope, I hope. So, the caramel has. melted a little bit more, I'm gonna see if I can get it, spread it out. Now we want to do this. fairly quickly, y'all, because, all right, I'm going to turn our stove off and we're going to set these back in here, in the oven for a few minutes and let the leftover heat just melt all of our chocolate and our toffee and our nuts and everything. That looks very uneven but I'll make it up with this bowl. I do love milk chocolate though. And that bowl is milk chocolate. In fact, I think normally, I use just milk chocolate. (cat meows) What, pumpkin? What, pumpkin? Okay. Next with the toffee, - [Theresa] Hmm. which the toffee just brings. it right on over the top. - [Theresa] I forget how easy this is. - It's so easy. Right, does it look like. I'm getting it even? - [Theresa] Maybe some. like right in that area, like kinda of the center. - Oh, right there. Eyes are not what they use to be. Maybe right there? - [Theresa] I'd put a. little bit more, like, right in here. - Okay, right there. - [Theresa] There you go, mm hmm. - All right, now, to me, this is the best part, the nuts. I am a nut lover. And it's so hard to. believe people, that, say - [Theresa] Well, think about. people that are allergic. - Yeah. - [Theresa] I mean, that. would be a terrible. - Yeah, but, you know, when they tell me now don't put any nuts in. the cream cheese icing. - [Theresa] What? (laughs) What, are you serious? - Does that look pretty even, Theresa? - [Theresa] Yes, ma'am. - Good. All right, so, back in the oven these go. The oven's been turned off. We don't need it to cook, we just need to melt. There we go, three minutes. Mm mm mm. So that was three minutes, y'all. And they will cut easier if you cut them while they're warm. And I would try to cut them the size of the saltine, like that. Now where can I, where can I find that other saltine. It's hard to tell. - [Theresa] I know all that butter melts into those saltines. - It just melts into it. All right, I got out one cracker. (laughs) Heavenly days, y'all. The salty from the saltine crackers with the sweet, so good. Yeah, you'd think you could tell. - [Theresa] I have to be honest, the time that I think I made this, which has been, I didn't, I let it cool off. - Yeah. - [Theresa] And then it kind of broke up. - Yeah, Yeah. - [Theresa] It may not have. broken up beautifully into, but it broke up like pieces of candy. - Right. - [Theresa] Like crack candy. - Yeah. (laughs) So I think you get the gist or as Aunt Peggy said. I got so (indistinct) at her one day. Oh, and if Michael was here, he'd laugh all over again too, because he was there when she said it. Oh, you get the zest. (laughs) I love you, Aunt Peggy. Eddy and I just got back from Albany. I went to Albany, Indiana book signing at Anne's garden shop. And it's, you know, Theresa, that was the first book. signing I've done since COVID. - [Theresa] I know. - And it was a huge turnout, huge turnout. - [Theresa] I bet Anne was, did Anne know what to do with herself. - She was running around, honey, working her head off. - [Theresa] I don't. think people ever realize how many people are. really going to show up. - Well, you, you don't ever know. - [Theresa] I've learned. - Okay. I'm thinking she'd show up, right here, at this crack party. - [Theresa] I can tell. - Delicious. Would you like some crack? - [Theresa] I sure would. - Your family is going to love it. Or whoever you share it with, they going to love it. Merry Christmas.;['postres']
vbItrX11tqQ.json;- I wanna share with y'all a. way to make a sweet biscuit. John Reed, one of our grandboys, we celebrated his birthday here Sunday, and the little fella, he just ordered up, he wanted ham biscuits, grits. He said let's omelets, so, and this was all at dinner time, now. So I thought it was the cutest. menu that he came up with because he had had all this. at my house in the past, and he liked it enough that. to be his birthday meal. So on top of making the ham biscuits, I thought I'm gonna make. him some sweet biscuits using my biscuit mix. So that's what I did, and. this is how many that's left. This is what the finished. product looks like (laughs). They were so good. They were a huge, huge hit. Those have got to be put in the biscuit. graveyard today, though, but they were so good, and of. course, I made a ton of 'em. So without being able to. give you exact measurements, I'm gonna try to just show you what I did, and I think that I started with maybe two cups of my biscuit mix. Oh, that's like exactly, almost two cups. And naturally, I use my own biscuit mix, but if you don't have that, you can use anybody's biscuit. mix that you would like, the biscuit mix of your choice. All right, so I'm gonna. get a little bit more. So that's two cups. And I'm gonna put that in our bowl, and I'm gonna add, this. is a half a cup measure, but that looks like a about a fourth or a third a cup of. sugar, so about like that. Might as well use it all happily. And I'm gonna take off my rings to do this 'cause this can kind of be a little goopy. All right, so I'm just gonna mix that up, and you almost can do it, you know, making a kind of a snapping. motion with your fingers. Now I'm gonna add... Let's see, I'm gonna add like maybe two tablespoons of butter and about two ounces of cream cheese. And this can be ice cold right outta the refrigerator, y'all, because what we're gonna do is. we're gonna take our fingers, and we're just gonna snap. all that into our biscuit mix until it becomes crumbly looking. And you're going to love. this sweet biscuit, honey. You're going to love it. All right. And I'm using mine. Usually I do this on an old table cloth that I keep around to roll my dough on, but I decided I just grabbed. the closest clean pillowcase. They make good surfaces. for rolling out dough. And you'll know when you got this right when all the big pieces. of butter and cream cheese are feeling on the small size, kinda like English peas or small peas. All right. Now I'm gonna add some sprinkles. Maybe that many. I can always add more. when I'm rolling 'em out. I think I want just a little bit more. There you go. All right, this is where. the guessing comes in, but I got two cups of biscuit mix, and that's three fourths. a cup of buttermilk. And it's important with. my biscuit mix to me, and I get us any biscuit mix you using, use buttermilk because it gives. it that kind of tart flavor that makes it so good. So I'm just gonna... All right, that's probably. about a half a cup, and I'm just gonna start with that, and I'll add more if I need it. I'm just gonna stir that. around and see what I got. Here comes big daddy. - [Michael] I smell pork chops. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] You know you. can smell a pork chop. Well, it's a good thing. you left when you did 'cause I made those strawberry fritters, and they'd make you jump back and slap. - [Man] They're good, huh? - Yes. - [Michael] About time. you make something good. - [Man] Where's that frying pan? She's gonna- - You're sassy. - [Paula] Who will take him? Anybody. - Well, give 'em money. - Listen, I'll put a bow around his neck and give him away. All right, so I used, I wound up using that full three fourths a cup, and I might use some. more, but I don't know. I to got get in here and feel of it. - [Michael] Yeah, Paula, it's tough being a damn trophy husband. (Paula laughing) - [Woman] You are on a. roll today, aren't you? - Well, I have not talked to. Bradley Cooper's wife yet, but I'm sure it is. - Somebody said their wife. was was a trophy wife. He said, but she wasn't first place. (all laughing) - Did she place at all? (all laughing) All right, so I just dampen. that with a little more, one little squirt of buttermilk, and now I'm fixing to take more of my mix, and I'm gonna sprinkle it. around on my pillowcase. My hands are just not quite big enough to hold all these big things. Okay. All right, so I'm just gonna kneed, just kneed our dough, Gone pat it out. - [Man] These really were. great for a birthday party. - [Paula] Oh, they're. wonderful for a birthday party 'cause John's not crazy about cake, but he loves like a donut. cake or something like that. All right, so now I'm gonna. take some ground cinnamon, and I'm just gonna sprinkle a. little bit of ground cinnamon, and I'm gonna fold it back over so that cinnamon is in the middle. See why a pillowcase works so good? It'll help you maneuver it. So I'm just gonna pat it out. Looking good. (oil spraying) All right, I'm gonna spray my pan, and this is the size biscuit. cutter I want to use. So there we go. And if you have any extra... - [Michael] And if you. don't have a cutter, you can use like a juice class. - [Paula] Yes. - Yeah, that's what I do. - [Paula] That's what you do. - Yep. - [Paula] And I like my. biscuits close together. These biscuits are truly delicious. And just push 'em through like that. And then we'll reroll our scraps when we are done cutting. all our biscuits out. Did you eat one of these, Michael? - [Michael] Yeah, I finally did. I was- - You gave in. - [Michael] I gave in. - You caved. Okay, so we just gonna take our scraps, kneed them a little bit more. - [Man] John was impressed. with 'em when he came in saw- - [Paula] Oh, he was? - [Man] On the two tiered stand. - [Paula] Good 'cause I was so busy, I didn't get to see his reaction to 'em. Now, you can cut these as thick, just depends on, you know,. how much you pat 'em out. All right, so another scrap reload. So that is it. All right, let's see what. I want to do with them. Do I want to egg wash. 'em, or do I want to... You know what I think I'm gonna do? - [Michael] Put butter on 'em. - Well, I got butter in them, and I think that's what. I did the other day, but something... Excuse me, I got to wash my hands again. (water running) When I made all those. the other day, Michael, I had you put the butter on it, didn't I? The little butter pats. - [Michael] Yeah. So it made 'em so good - Uh-huh, a little touch of butter. And you don't need much. because like I said, there's butter in it. - [Michael] Last thing you want do is overdo it with the butter, right? - [Paula] That's exactly right. I'm learning you good. But I'll tell you something else that- - [Michael] You remember,. you did the butter in the hamburgers? - Oh my gosh, those butter burgers. Now, they'll make you. wanna walk up and slap me, won't they? I just wanted do something special for our Sunday birthday gathering, and it turned out to be a big hit. All right, this also works good. I gotta wash my hands again, y'all. (water running) This also works good to help them brown, and I just use a butter flavored, no calories, no cholesterol, and no carbs. All right, so I'm gonna. put these in the oven. I'll bake them on about. 350 until they're done. And should I put a little. more sprinkles on them? Think I should. - [Michael] Cinnamon, put more cinnamon. - Well, the cinnamon's. on the inside, monkey. - [Michael] I know, put more on there. (loud blowing sound) - So you don't think. I put enough cinnamon? - [Michael] No, but it's good. - Okay, well, how about if I do this? - [Michael] Glad to see it. - Just on part of 'em. Now, there's all different kind. of ways you can make these. So if you make 'em, please. let me to hear from you 'cause I sure do want to know. Raisins and nuts would be good in 'em. You could almost make. 'em like a cinnamon roll. So in the oven this goes, and it'll probably take maybe 15 minutes, but our oven's gotta get hot first. And you know, I said you could. use all kind of sprinkles, but these little jimmies- - [Woman] How about you give those to me? - [Paula] Oh, okay. Those little jimmies hold up good 'cause they're big. enough that they'll stay. - [Man] Yeah, and it actually added like an extra little... I almost thought you had raisins in it when I bit into it.. - Did you? - [Man] But I mean, those. have a little texture to it. - Uh-huh, well, I can't wait 'cause I hope that's the. way I made 'em Sunday, but I can't swear to it 'cause you know I change my own recipes. Some days you feel like a. nut and some days you don't. All right, so our confetti. or sweet biscuits are ready. Now I've got confection sugar here. I probably got about a cup and a half, and I'm going to add... Oh, it's empty. Let me run over here. and et some more, Eddie. All right, that's about. a teaspoon of vanilla. And a little water just till. it's the right consistency. And you'll wanna ice these while your sweet biscuits are warm. Look at that cute little whisk. Isn't that cute? That's my speed. And I did put a pinch of salt in here too to cut the sweet taste just a little bit. All right, so I'm gonna put a little bit because I had to let my. biscuits sit a minute so they're not as warm as I. would have liked for them to be, so I'm making a little bit thinner. So here we go. Just like a donut, you know? And the warmer your biscuits. are, the more it will spread. So you don't want 'em to be too cold, but you don't want 'em. to be too hot either. This is so good, y'all. And it's just a different form of a birthday cake celebration. I gotta get the sprinkles on. them before the glaze dries, so our... Boy, that was like perfect. amount of powdered sugar. Okay. Ooh, that's good. So just few more sprinkles for the top. Stick a birthday candle in. those, and call them done. I wish Michael could eat one. He can't, but I guess I can. So good. You can make 'em as sweet as you want, as buttery as you want. Delicious. So please tell me y'all try it. If you change it around any,. let me know what you did.;['postres']
VdWM48aTiXA.json;"- Guess what friends? This is it. This is number 12 of the 12. days of Christmas cookies. Didn't take us but about 24 days to get to 12 did it Theresa?

You know, I'll try to do. those Christmas cookies you know the sugar cookies. that you roll out and cut out and then try to paint. them and all that stuff. I ain't got time. I ain't got time for that. So I'm much more fond of these. All right, so let's. see what Sandy says do. ""Preheat the oven to 350,. beat the cream cheese, granulated sugar, and butter. with an electric mixer."" We can do that. Okay. (beater whirls) All right, Sandy said to beat that for about one minute and. then scrape down the sides. Now we're gonna add our egg and we're gonna beat it. for bring another minute (beater whirls) or so. Now I'm gonna take our all purpose flour. It's. about a cup and a half of flour. No it's not about, it is a. cup and a half of flour y'all. And I'm gonna add my baking. powder and my salt to our flour and then we're gonna slowly add this into our eggy mixture. (beater whirls). (metal clangs) I love that little tang of. saltiness with my cookies. Theresa don't you?. - Mhmm. - Yes ma'am. Okay, I'm gonna turn. that down a little bit. Then I was gonna add, oh gosh, I think it's a fourth or. a third cup at the time. Okay. You wanna just beat that together until it's, you know, just incorporated. So I think Sandy is telling. us not to over beat it. You know, these are so hard to. get all the dough out of it. Probably a dough hook would've been better cause you only have like two pieces to try to get out the dough. So it's incorporated good, but I'm gonna come around in here and make sure I scrape the. sides of our bowl real good. And the bottom of your bowl to make sure all that's incorporated. So Sandy tells us to chill this for about 15 or 20 minutes, you know, get a little firmness to it. And she said to drop 'em using a one and a half inch utensil. She just said, let me see, ""Using a one and a half inch scoop dollop batter into rounds,. space two inches apart on baking sheep with parchment paper. So here we go. Okay Sandy, our cookie. dough has been sitting here in the refrigerator. drawer and I'm so excited. You know, let me refresh. myself on what I'm doing here. I know you tell us to use. a one and a half inch scoop and I really don't have a scoop that size. All right, let's see.. ""Bake about 12 minutes, ""rotating baking sheets from top to bottom through bake time. Cookie tops will not have any browning but will be slightly cracked and should spring back. when lightly touched."" Okay. Okay, so we're gonna dust. them with powdered sugar after they come out. We gonna make the little indention. so it can hold the cherry and I'll see how close I'm gonna get because she said this makes 21 cookies. So we'll see. Wish you were here Sandy,. wish you were here girl. Sandy, you won't believe this, hon. Look, I can get one more.. We're at 20 right now. I think I can turn that though into 21. I'm gonna turn it into 21. if I have to stand here all afternoon and get that,. scrape that dough out. Oh cookie. 21 cookies Sandy. - Going in the oven.. - Mm mm mmm. - [Theresa] How many minutes? 12? - Mm. This batter is so good. You know there's just nothing that'll take the place of cream cheese. - [Theresa] How many minutes? - Oh. I said a while ago and now I can't. - I think you said 350--. - 15 to 20 minutes. Oh no, that's what we refrigerate it. 12 minutes. Sandy, yours turned out. prettier than mine, honey. Your picture - I'm gonna buy you a scoop.. (laughs) I think it's the scoops. that makes the difference. - That's what I want for--. - Christmas. - Christmas.. - I'm gonna tell Santa Claus to bring you a scoop. - All right, now I'm making a little house for the cherry that's gonna go in there. Yeah, Sandy said they wouldn't get brown but my oven may have been hot. You know, I cook on a. commercial oven y'all so it's a bad boy. So I have to adjust cooking time on whatever I'm cooking, you know, just have to. adjust it and play with it. 21 cookies. - [Theresa] I think they look beautiful. - All right now do I. powder sugar on now? Yeah. I powder sugar before--. - They cool. - Yeah. And we gonna let 'em cool. Oops. And then we put the cherry in.. - Yes. - We gonna let 'em completely cool. They look delicious. After these have cooled completely, Sandy said, stick the. little cherry down in there. Now, if you're making 'em for. like tomorrow or the next day don't put the cherry in 'em. until you're ready to serve because that cherry has got moisture in it and it could make the. cookie kind of gooey. So I don't mind it gooey. Look how pretty. Mm. It's like an incredible shortbread cookie. I mean, it just crumbles in your mouth. It truly does melt in your mouth. All right lemme get a. little bite of cherry. Mhm, mmm, mm, Sandy, thank you so much and I'm waiting on the next recipe, okay? Merry Christmas darling. Wherever you are, Dubai or the States, Merry Christmas with love and thanks.";['postres']
VfSgi_axUI0.json;hey everybody i'm paula deen and i hope you have room in your recipe box because today we're making cookies my magnolia lace trumpets are truly one of the prettiest things you've ever eaten all my friends tell me that my savannah bow ties with chocolate dipping sauce are the first things to go when they make them for bake sales and i'll lay it on thick with my loaded oatmeal cookies with brown butter icing so get out your tins and call your friends cookies need a crowd i'm getting ready to go to a cookie swap but i have a little problem i got an empty cookie jar and i've got to fill it but before i can do that there's about two gadgets that i need to go pick up so we can make these cookies come out quick and easy and perfect so y'all hang with me cause we got cookies to bake [Music] good morning good morning how are y'all doing i'm getting ready to bake cookies maybe you can help show me some things that would make the job a little bit easier what do you recommend we've got our traditional professional baker's pen they're really hard to beat aren't they they are anything else i can use yes i think i would actually like to invest in some type of form something like a little column little bit exactly okay she said i'm making her trumpet shaped oh i have just the thing okay okay for that you can wrap the cookie right around that real quick nice and tapered that is pretty i can't wait to use them thank you very much and come again and if you need anything else give a yell oh i appreciate it thank you thank you bye what a great shop that was i could have spent half the day there kathy had so many great things and as usual i overspent but there was a couple of things that i couldn't resist but the first cookie we're going to start with is the magnolia lace trumpets so we're going to start with a stick of butter and a half a cup of sugar and i'm going to add about a third of a cup of dark corn syrup when we get through with them they're going to look like little rounds of lace i'm going to turn that off and we're going to take our flour and we're going to add a half a teaspoon of ginger toss that around into the flour and then we're just dumping it right in there and we're just going to stir them up until all the flour is incorporated in there the last thing that i'm going to add though is one tablespoon of bailey's irish cream oh i love that stuff and you could certainly use different liqueurs now i've really got something that i want to show you that i think you'll love and it's called a silpat it's made of silicone and they're just fabulous for cookie bacon they're a little on the pricey side but i think you'll love it if you locate them now to scoop up our batter onto our cookie sheet i'm going to use a one teaspoon measuring spoon and a small offset spatula and this is going to spread i know it doesn't look like much batter but you're going to be amazed at at how big this cookie actually gets we're not going to do but three at the time because they'll get crisp and hard and then we won't be able to roll them we're gonna put this into a 350 degree oven uh and bake it for about eight or eight and a half minutes you'll really have to watch these because your oven may vary a little bit from mine but i've found that eight and a half minutes is just about perfect and while those are baking i'm gonna make the cream that goes inside of them which really makes this cookie just melt in your mouth and uh we're gonna start with some crisco that sounds yummy already doesn't it good southern cookie crisco and butter all right that's mixed up and now i'm gonna heat our milk i'm gonna get it just nice and hot and in the meantime i'm going to come back over here and add our sugar and cream that together very well and i'm going to add one egg white [Music] this is coming together nicely now i'm gonna add our hot milk one tablespoon at the time now all i have to do is add one teaspoon of vanilla and we're ready to fill now let's see if our cookies are ready all right these look like they're ready that was just about perfect timing for us now this is when we have to work very very quickly they're just still a little bit warm at this point to work with i'm so excited about this little form all right now i'm just going to turn that over because i really want the lacy part to be on the outside of the cookie and all we do is slip that out and we've got our trumpet look how easy that kong made this that's just a perfect trumpet now while those are getting cool for us we're gonna come over here and take our piping bag and i'm gonna fill this these cookies are so pretty when you're finished and i'm just gonna put the bag down in there and start filling how beautiful is that magnolia lace trumpets i've just got to have a taste oh i promise you this one's going to be the first one gone y'all stick around because i'm fixing to show you some neat savannah bow ties with a chocolate dipping sauce [Music] [Music] the next cookie we're fixing to make is called savannah bow ties and every cookie i make i'll you'll see me taste it and say oh that's my favorite that's my favorite that one no that one's my favorite i love this cookie we're just gonna start with about a half a cup of almond paste this is a product that's more on the hard side i'm going to help it along just by slicing it up kind of give him a little head start on getting beaten and we're going to use one egg yolk and we're gonna actually use this white in just a few minutes when we're finishing up our cookies so nothing's gonna go to waste that's the way i like it now i'm going to add brown sugar and milk now we're going to take our board and lightly dust it because we don't want this sticking and then we're going to move our puff pastry over here you can buy this in the frozen food section of your grocery store and it's so easy to work with and we're going to roll it out to approximately 14 inches i've even got a tape measure here so that i can kind of gauge it as we go you know you this dish is just hard to mess up when you're using a good product like the puff pastry it's just fabulous and this is what we're going to use on our savannah bow ties now we're going to cut our puff pastry in the middle just like that and now we're going to put that almond filling on one side of this puff pastry now there's several different ways that you can do this i like to periodically drop some and like i said this is really the hardest part of this whole cookie recipe but it's gonna make you look like you're a first-rate pastry chef i made these cookies for michael he loves them in fact i sometimes wonder if that's why he asked me to marry him because he knew he'd have his own personal little cookie baker so what i'm gonna do is get a piece of wax paper and some nonstick spray and we're going to pat it down that way i don't know what i'd do without this spray comes in so handy so see how it just goes together just like that i think i'm even going to try this let's see how that works we just found a new trick that's great see you just learn something new every time you cook all right now we're just gonna fit one sheet on top of the other just like that so we're going to cut 14 one inch strips with our wheel see those pretty edges and then we're going to come back and we're going to cut them directly in half just like that then we're going to gently pull them apart then we're going to pick up our cookie we're going to give it two twists and you got yourself a savannah bow tie i'm placing these on a cookie sheet with tinfoil i did not spray it because there's so much butter in puff pastry that you're not gonna have to worry about it sticking the next step is to beat that egg white remember that egg white that we had left over from the almond filling but we're gonna beat that now we're gonna take a little pastry brush and just paint these and that egg wash is gonna give them a pretty shiny coat i think on these i'm to sprinkle a little coarse sugar on them see how simple those are to make and they're just going to be spectacular now we're going to put these in the oven and we're going to let them bake for about 12 to 15 minutes so they'll be ready in no time and while those are cooking i'm gonna show you what makes these cookies so grand all right i've got sugar half a teaspoon of salt and some cornstarch and we're going to break up our chocolate into our pot and we're going to add our cream and we've got one egg yolk that we're gonna temper into our pot tempering means heat slowly if we didn't temper that yolk into there it could very well turn out like a scrambled egg in there and we don't want scrambled eggs and chocolate and i'm gonna beat up this yolk just slightly using a fork and i'm gonna add a little bit of the warm chocolate to that and i'm gonna keep on until i've got it to about a half a cup and stir it back into the chocolate and it's getting thick on it so now it's time to cut off the fire and i'm going to add a little bit of vanilla flavoring to it we actually got like a hot fudge sauce we're getting very close our savannah bow ties look so good look at them and i promised you they wouldn't stick on the tinfoil because of the butter that's in the puff pastry have you ever seen such a decadent cookie i think it's time for a taste i know that's why he asked me to marry him y'all stick around we're gonna make paula's loaded oatmeal cookies yum with a brown butter icing [Music] well is everybody ready to make my loaded oatmeal cookies this is so so simple don't let all these ingredients up here scare you because it's very very simple and easy we're going to take flour we're going to see how good i am cloves cinnamon allspice ginger the fourth half teaspoon of nutmeg baking soda baking powder and a little salt that was very simple even though it looked like a lot of ingredients so we're just going to sift those together with our all-purpose flour so that's all we're going to do there we're going to move on over here and we're going to start creaming our shortening with our butter love me a little crisco in with my butter and we're just going to cream those together the next thing we're going to do is add our brown sugar so we're going to prime our brown sugar into our butter and crisco now we're going to add one egg all right now we're gonna just beat in our flour and the buttermilk beat it for a minute and then we're adding the last of our flour all right the buttermilk's worked in there and here goes the last we're going to add about a teaspoon of vanilla now all right the rest of the ingredients we're just gonna fold in by hand and that will be our oatmeal our nuts now i'm using a walnut and raisins nice fat plump raisins so we're just gonna fold this all up we've got our batter ready i'm gonna get our cookie sheets and this time i'm gonna use the parchment paper and we're just going to see how that works in comparison to the other that we used i'm going to give it a light spray i'm always grabbing pam arna and then i'm gonna drop it by the teaspoonful onto the paper now one thing about cookies the most important thing is that you make them all the same size all right these are ready to go into the oven and then we're going to be checking on them in about eight or nine minutes now while those are getting ready we're going to make our brown butter icing we're going to take a sis a stick of butter y'all act surprised and we're gonna melt that and we're actually gonna cook it until it's kind of a light brown now you'll want to be very very careful here because you know that butter will burn all right our butter is starting to brown a little bit you can see it foaming up and you can see it's starting to change colors on us all right now we're just gonna add the powdered sugar and mix that up together put in our vanilla flavoring all right now we're going to start adding our water you'll hear me say all the time you can always add two but you can't take out so we'll want to do a little at the time kind of beat that up and you can see it's just a nice light tan color let's check on the cookies and see what they look like they should be about ready oh they look so good all right we're ready to drizzle and if our consistency's not right we'll go back so you thought an oatmeal cookie couldn't get any better why don't we get them up off of that you can see how nice that that worked for us don't those look delicious i'm gonna go for this one that has the most brown butter icing on it whole new twist to the oatmeal cookie y'all go pour yourself a big glass of milk and come back cause i got some tips for you [Music] i want to just share with you a couple of quick tips that will make your cookies mouth-watering the first thing you'll always want to do is start with two trays so you can always drop your batter onto a cooled tray and talking about cute little totes this chinese takeout just makes the cutest little carryout and on those magnolia lace trumpets slip a little ribbon on them for a real real festive look how pretty is that if you should have a cookie swap to go to i hope that you'll consider making paula's loaded oatmeal cookies these beautiful magnolia lace trumpets or these sinful savannah bow tie cookies so as always y'all i wish you best dishes from my kitchen to yours;['postres']
VoJubHfE7T0.json;- Y'all know what season it is by the things I've got. up here on my counter. It's apple season. And so I'm gonna make some baked apples 'cause you love baked. apples, don't you Michael. - [Michael] Yeah, I like apple pies, too. (laughter) - Your favorite though is my. fried apple pies, isn't it. - Yeah, that's one of my favorites. - Oh gosh, it's so good. But today we're gonna go. a little healthier route and certainly a little bit easier. Now I have sliced about a half inch off the top of my apples, and I got some fruit fresh. I kind of sprinkled on it so they wouldn't turn brown,. but they gonna get brown, 'cause I'm gonna put 'em in the oven. So you just wanna make sure. when you start doing your coring that you don't bust through to the bottom because then all those,. your spices and your juices, they'll leave, they'll run out. And we don't want that to happen. So Michael has just walked. in the house, y'all. He has been having some back problems and he's going to Mayo. down in Jacksonville and they're working on trying to help him manage this pain. There's some guys out there, let's see their last name is Ritis? - [Michael] Yeah. - And I think out all of. the Ritis boys out there, that Arthr is the worst one of them. I've met Arthr, and I don't like him. So I think Arthr has been bestin' you too. - Oh yeah. - [Paula] Hadn't he, Michael? - It's unusual for the young. guys like me to get it. (laughter) - Yeah, since you're nine. years younger than me. (laughter) That shouldn't be happening to you. All right, so you can see. how I cored out our apples and I'm just gonna sprinkle. a little fruit fresh on that and I'm gonna put it my casserole dish, see how we've done it. They naturally, you don't have. to cut any of the bottom off, 'cause they've got a natural. stool that they sit on. So I have got like a half a cup of sugar. There's my spoon. I've got a half a teaspoon. of fresh ground nutmeg. And I really do like. using the fresh ground. It's just so much better. And I've got a teaspoon of cinnamon. (mixing) So I'm just gonna mix that together. We gonna drop that in the cavity. (mixing) After we get it all mixed up. Now this is enough to. probably do six apples right here but I'm only doing four, so just don't put drop that right into the. cavity, just like that. You know, these are so If you feel like you've. got to have a dessert this is a good way to me, to have your cake and eat it too with this dessert. Cause an apple a day keeps. a doctor away, right, Mikey? - [Michael] Maybe not those.. (laughter) - I was gonna say - Maybe without the sugar. - Well, you know what? You could use a sugar substitute. You know, there's baking. substitutes out there, so you could certainly use that. But now here's one where. you're not gonna substitute. And that's a little butter. I'm just gonna kinda press that in. It's like a teaspoon. Just press it in like that. And then to make sure the butter gets a little sugar on it. I'm just gonna sprinkle a little more. - [Michael] We used to make. butter and sugar sandwiches when we were little.. - Every child has. It was such a cheap treat. I did the same thing, Michael. Got my white bread out. and smeared butter on it and sprinkled it with sugar, and then. All right, I've got a cup of apple juice, and I'm not going pour it over the apples, I'm gonna pour it in the. dish around my apples. And now I'm gonna cover this with tin foil and I'm gonna bake it for. about 45 minutes to an hour. Really depending on how. you like your apples. If you like 'em firm, or real soft, I keep. looking at this sugar. I just can't stand the thoughts of it. - [Michael] Wasted.. - I know. I mean, I could save it,. make French toast with it but I was afraid I was too- - [Michael] You could pour. it in that apple juice. - That's a good idea, Michael. Just a little.. (laughter) All right. So tin foil, and we are ready to go. (clunking) (crinkling) (clunking) (bang) Oops. - [Woman] That scared me. - Did it, I'm sorry.. (crinkling) When I'm covering any dish with tin foil that's going into the oven, I like to spray it because especially I've noticed. it especially with meats, Michael, I don't know if. you've ever noticed it. But you cover it up with tin foil and then you go to take your tin foil off. - [Michael] I spray mine with duck fat. - Yeah, that's good too. From my duck fat in that drawer. - Well, I didn't know it was just yours. I thought you shared with me. - I do share with you. Yeah, so I like to spray the. tin foil because sometimes flecks of that tin foil. will actually get on whatever you're cooking. And like I said, I find. it especially with meats. Now another thing. (crinkling) that I have to be mindful of is that is a commercial oven in there that I'm cooking with,. and the fan is so strong (crinkling) that it'll blow my tin foil. off, so I had to wrap it extra, extra long, so it can. wrap around it like that. It's kinda hard to just. one person doing this, (crinkling) I don't wanna cover it in the back. - Does it need to be sealed, because this one has this. isn't sealed over here. - No, I think it's, I think it's all. - You want me to put it?. - Yeah. - It's good to go.. - Okay. But we will have to watch it, because like I said that fan is so strong, it'll blow that tin foil right off, and then you'll hear this cranking and beating around in there, But I wouldn't trade my. commercial oven for anything. Any kitchen appliance. Maybe my air fryer, not my air fryer. So 45 minutes, we can sit down. and share an apple, Michael. (laughter) And you know what? It would be delicious with. a scoop of vanilla ice cream sitting beside of it. - Anything's better with ice cream. - Yes, I agree. - Y'all, our apples just turned out beautiful. (scraping) yummy looking. And this is the softness. that I like my baked apples. - [Woman] I was gonna say. it should still be hot. - They're hot but so good. So, so good, it makes a wonderful dessert or an afternoon snack.. (glassware clinking) And if you're gonna serve if you're having guests and you're gonna serve them a dessert, a scoop of ice cream alongside. this plate of apple is delicious and you could. stick a cinnamon stick in it and a little piece of fresh mint, and you have a beautiful,. beautiful dessert. Mm. Look at that, skin and all, cause the skin they say. is the most important part that you eat, that's where. a lot of your vitamins are. - [Woman] Look at Popeye. - I feel so healthy.. (laughter) Yum. Delicious. (chewing) Bye, y'all.;['postres']
w87HqFD8Glg.json;(bowl clatters) - Okay y'all (laughs). I just thought up something, and I hope y'all are game (laughs) with me, along with me, because it's peach season.. (bag crinkles) So I thought when I was talking with. Teresa the other day, I said what do you think we could do something different. besides peach ice cream or peach preserves or peach cobbler or, oh gosh, I would love some peach, (laughs) pies, my peach pies, my apple pie, fried, you know, fried. - Oh yeah (indistinct).. - Oh gosh. They're so good. They are so good. My grandma used to make it all the time. So I thought why can't. we make peach hoecakes and serve them with a. little peach preserve? You know,. - You'd better. - why can't we do that? - We can.. - So let's try, okay (laughs)? So y'all hang with me. Now it's so much easier to peel a peach if you drop them in boiling water, and all you want to do is. like make a little cross in the top of that peach, and we're gonna drop it. in that boiling water and leave it just a minute or two. It doesn't take but just a minute. We're gonna wait for our water to boil, and then we gonna drop. them, and that skin, because you put that notch in it, that skin kind of come,. pops up a little bit, and you just take that,. and those four notches just peel right off. Now is that a beautiful. Georgia peach or what? That is beautiful, and the. skin just slipped right off, because I dropped it. in that boiling water, you know, put that little notch in it. You know trying to come up. (knife slices) with something different for hoecakes. Now if this works, this. is gonna make a wonderful, quick, easy little. dessert for after dinner, because when we were serving. hoecakes at the restaurant, lots of people would have their hoecake with the syrup that we had on. the table for their dessert. I'm not kidding, it's that good. So I'm gonna have Teresa or whoever puts the recipe up, - [Teresa] Yeah. - but I'm only halving. it, since I don't know, if I'm, if this is gonna turn. out, but we're gonna see. But it does not tell you in my recipe, and I don't know why I didn't put that, but it calls for one. cup of self-rising flour and one cup of self-rising corn meal. But what I left out was one. little three letter word, corn meal mix. See that, corn meal mix. So that's the kind of. meal you want to use. So like I said, I've halved the recipe, and I have got, I put. two tablespoons of sugar. Now the regular hoecake recipe. calls for one tablespoon, but I've halved it, and I. added two tablespoons for this. I didn't have any buttermilk, but I just took some of. my regular sweet milk and put some vinegar in that. All right, so a third of a cup. I think it was a third,. (water runs) well, I don't know. exactly how much it was. I just looked at it and measured like half of what I thought three fourths would be. So that's the story on that. I just love experimenting, you know, and coming up with new recipes. It's just fun.. (batter mixes) And some will stick, and some won't. All right, so we've got our. milk, our corn meal mix, our self rising flour,. (egg cracks) and our sugar in here.. (batter mixes) So I don't know if I'm gonna need to add any water to that. Maybe just a little. I mean just a squirt, because I think these peaches, I'm gonna kind of just. give them a squeeze. The peaches have lots of juice in it,. (peaches squish) so we'll kind of just mash them by hand, and y'all saw the juice. coming out of them. (Paula laughs) So this will be like a. quick peek shortcake. - Yum.. - Yes. All right.. (water rushes) So I'm gonna fry these. At the restaurant, we. fried them in butter, in straight butter, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna do like half butter, and half vegetable oil. (butter bubbles) The thing about what really,. really makes a good hoecake is that you're using enough fat for it come up around that batter. You don't want it covered, but you want it to be able to come up about halfway of that hoecake, so it has something to fry in. Now that first one I put. in there just wasn't ready. Our fat just wasn't ready. So I may have to toss that one. It may be too greasy. And I'm gonna go ahead and put some paper towels on a plate, so I can drain them.. (oil bubbles) Let's see if this one's ready to flip. (spatula scrapes pan) And I believe it is Eddie. Oh, shut up Eddie, shut up. Now if this works, this is gonna be a. wonderful, quick dessert. And you want to move your pan around, 'cause you know, your pan always has, as you know, it always will cook faster in some spots depending on. what kind of heat you've got. So that outside edge, it doesn't, it doesn't cook quite as fast. That piece of peach kind. of ran away from that one. Shut up Eddie (laughs), shut up! Oh my goodness. And aren't we lucky that. I cooked three hoecakes? 'Cause there's 1, 2, 3 of us. How about a scoop of. vanilla ice cream on this? Boing (laughs). Wouldn't that be good? And then top it with some. warm peach preserves, you know, just put your peach. preserves in the microwave and just eat it up, spoon that on top. Oh, folks will think you've been working all day long in that kitchen. All right, I'm gonna turn this off. I know I got still more batter to make, but we gonna stop this foolishness, and we gonna taste (laughs). Y'all ready? So we're gonna have to decide what kind of topping. If y'all would like vanilla ice cream, I've got that if you want. to try that on the side. But let's just see what we got, and I'm gonna be very honest. If it's not good,. - Where's the butter? - oh, you won't more butter? Okay (laughs). I'm gonna be real honest if it's not good. - [Teresa] Do you want. a little bit of that? You know you do.. - I'll take a little. (knife slices) That's still real hard Teresa. - [Teresa] I know, I was. thinking the same thing. - So if it's not worth the effort, I'm gonna tell y'all the truth. - [Teresa] Worth the effort? (Paula mumbles) Which means you could. probably do other things, like you could do blueberries. There's something about this with the peach.. - It is something about the peach. Now I don't carry, we don't. carry blueberry preserves in any of our stores,. - That's true. - but we do carry this. wonderful peach preserve. - [Teresa] And it goes really. well with the cornmeal. - Yes. - [Teresa] I don't know that. every fruit would do that. - No, but definitely a peach. I mean I would put this in a pretty little glass dish and scoop up. - Yeah. - a small scoop of. vanilla ice cream on it, and then put my warmed up. peach preserves on top, and it's gonna look like. you worked for a long time. Oops, and you could make. these earlier in the day and then heat them up in your air fryer. And they'll be just like. you just cooked them. - [Teresa] Eddie wants you to. wrap it up so he can finish. - Okay.. (Teresa laughs) I do hope y'all will try them, because they're out of this world. I'm gonna eat the whole thing. (Paula sighs) (indistinct) best dishes y'all.;['postres']
WbSqaBMjDbo.json;- Butter, y'all. But guess what? In this Halloween recipe, there's no butter, but there's some other. good stuff in it y'all. am gonna show you my version. of the ghoulish eyeballs and kids love them. So it's a super simple recipe y'all. You start with a red velvet cake mix and you cook it by the recipe. And now we're just going. to take that cake out, and we just used a one layer, a nine inch layer, and I'm going to crumble the cake up. That smells so good taste good too. Alright, now I'm gonna add, looks like a half a cup. - [lady] It's really the half of Can. It's a full can and the recipe-- - Okay this is a half a can of pre made cream cheese icing. - [Theresa] And it's good too. - It is good. for store bought. (laughs) If you're looking for a. quick sugar rush, Alright. And then I tell you to. just take your mixer, And I like just using my. little hand mixer for this. And just incorporate that icing y'all All through that cake. And longest and hardest part about this recipe is once. we get this mixed up, we are gonna have to put it in a freezer and let it sit. For three hours. Because its got to get really good and hard. And I cant wait to give. these to my grandchildren All of my grandchildren one of the ones that were old enough, they love Halloween but I'll tell you what John Reed, one of the middle boys, he adores Halloween. He likes it better than. Christmas aint that crazy. He just lives for one. Halloween after the other he loves dressing up and. pretending like he's a superpower. (laughs) He's so cute. Okaydoke. We've got this good and mixed up y'all and the hardest part about this recipe is putting it in the freezer for three hours and. letting it get real hard. And then this time, I think I'm going to put. them on a sucker stick, but you see if we try to do it now see that so soft that I never get a round ball out of that. So in the freezer it goes. And I can't wait to give these to my the little one, this Halloween. So I'll see y'all in three hours. Okeydoke, buddies This has been in the. freezer for three hours and it's nice and cold. So look at the red food coloring. I wonder if this is going to wash out. Look, I don't know if it will, but I don't care. - [Lady] We'll red is happy colors. - Yeah it is a happy color I guess fire. - [Lady] No orange is fire, red is a bit smile - Right? You're exactly right Theresa. Good point. (birds chirping) So You can make these eye. balls any size you want. And I'm making them about the size I think a real eye ball would be, but I have to tell you I've never taken my. eyeball out to check it. (laughs) Have y'all. That's a big eyeball right there. So the fact that you. don't have to bake this or do anything with it, but just stick those sticks in it. But after we make them into balls, we do have to stick them. back in the refrigerator for another hour. The refrigerator or the freezer? - [Theresa] freezer. - Okay. Back in the freezer. Okay. And then we'll put our sticks in and we're gonna melt our chocolate, and we go meltdown white chocolate. Then we'll show you a. couple of things you can use by the pupil of these ghoulish eyeballs. Okay. So melted I our white chocolate, and I'm taking my stick and dipping it into the melted chocolate. And that will help that eyeball, kinda hold onto that gooey center. Look at that one. - [Theresa] And you just. melted the chocolate right In the microwave? - Yeah right in the microwave. - [Theresa] And you. didn't add anything to it? - Nope. And now we're using red M&M'S. And. (birds chirping) Sorry I got to pause for. a finger lick on this. (laughs) And if our chocolate gets too thick I'll just run it one more. time back into the microwave. EyeBall's. - [Theresa] That eyeball are. important so that gonna stick - yes - [Theresa] The chocolate. will stick you won't - Yes, Theresa so smart.. (laughs) (laughs). - This is only because - You've never had children. - [Theresa] I know. - so you've never had to do this - [Theresa] I know. - But still You just got. to get good with you. - [Theresa] I have got. to prepared with you - You got good instincts. And plus, before she joined our family, she was a member of the Walt Disney family. So she had great skills. when she joined us. - [Theresa] Look how good that looks - I know I want some. Okay you know what Theresa this balls. I don't think we left them in. the freezer quite long enough. Because they're soft, they're really soft. (birds chirping) Okay. So why don't we do a couple of more, and then take a break because. these got to sit in the refrigerator one more time anyway. - [Theresa] They seem like. they're really hard to make and they're not. It's just the amount of time that they have to harden up. - Having an extra set of hands is nice. Okay. Cause see how I soft this already getting so we're going to have to no, it's so cute. We're going to have to stick. this back in the microwave this back in the fridge. And then we'll finish out, making up the palette. like a bloodshot eye. (laughs) Okay y'all so I've been. working away at this. I dipped them when you saw me last, I dipped them in the white chocolate, and I don't have any gel food coloring, which is exactly what we needed. So this we're having. trouble getting it to stick. So I'm just coming in there, with some red glitter. To stick to our drops of food coloring, and look at these precious eyeballs look. (laughs) the better to see you my dear. (laughs) Aint that cute but sometimes I have made them in the. past without the sticks. So I highly recommend. using the sticks y'all. Because it's just easier to handle. All right. So, you know do do this any way you want, any way you wanna do it. Just so they'll look bloodshot, and because it's running off and I don't have the gel, I'm just sprinkling it with this. So where there's a will, there's a way. (laughs) Wait. (laughs) do you know who this is? Can you tell who I am? (laughs) - [Theresa] The voice gave it away. - You know what? I kind of like Halloween to myself. So I think your children. will have so much fun getting in the kitchen with you. And do whatever works for you. You don't have to use. a red velvet cake mix. You can use any flavor that you like. And it'll turn out just delicious. But I would highly recommend the gel. (laughs) And not this because it. didn't want to stick. (birds chirping) And you know every time I do something. y'all I do it different. So no rules. That's right (birds chirping) I think its cute as can be. well Kitties and mommas and daddy's. I hope you have a wonderful thanks. Why am I rushing Thanksgiving? So this is twice. Now I've called a Halloween Thanksgiving or they are very close together though. Aren't they? And when October gets here when Halloween gets here to me, Christmas is here. So I hope you have a wonderful Christmas. Listen to me now.. (laughs) Hope y'all have a wonderful Halloween. Seeing what you can do. (laughs);['postres']

wJDdXEe8Ubc.json;"- Hey y'all, come on. in the kitchen with me. Today, I kind of look like a. peppermint candy, don't I Eddy? - [Eddy] Mhm. - Well guess what, recipe I'm fixing to share with y'all now? I think I'm dressed appropriately. We're going to be making peppermint bark. And I've got in mind y'all, I know when my boys were in grade school and Christmas would come around,. I'd go to the dime store. And I bought, you know, pretty little cheap glass containers. They were probably all 99 cents, and I would make all. different kinds of candies and fill those jars up, and. put a pretty bow on them. And my children would give. those as their teacher's gifts. And I remember Jamie Dean. still talks about it this day. He said, ""Mama, I was so proud."" ""I was so proud when I walked in."" And she said, ""Oh Jamie,. that's beautiful."" And he was so proud to. say, ""My mama made it."" ""My mama made it."" And like I said, to this day at 53 he still talks about that. So if you want to give. somebody a special gift but you don't have a budget. that would choke a horse. Personally, I love gifts where. people didn't necessarily have to go out and buy anything, but they actually gave of themselves. Because when you give something like this, you're given your time. which is very valuable. And to me, that makes it so, so special. So, when we get through with it, I have some little containers over here that we're going to put it in. And I do still like those glass jars that I used to get and use. So we're melting y'all two. pounds of white chocolate, and I've got them over a double boiler. You want to make sure that your bowl, the bottom of your bowl doesn't. actually touch the water. So to this we're gonna. add about two teaspoons of peppermint extract. So. We're going to take our candy canes or the round peppermints,. whatever you have, and I like putting these in. a bag and take my hammer. Take my hammer to them, and crush them. And you know, peppermint these days comes in all different colors. It's not necessarily just. the red and the whites so you can mix your colors. Personally I like the green and the red because my favorite Christmas ice cream. Y'all want to see it? Let me show it to you. This is my favorite,. favorite special vanilla. Got some vanilla. But look at it, Michael and I have almost eaten all of it. And see how it's got the red and the green peppermints in it? Oh, it's so good. So that would be pretty to fix a bowl of this ice cream all balled up, and stick a piece of. peppermint bark in it. That'd be a nice gift, if. your ice cream wouldn't melt. All right. So I'm stirring these up because that water is just boiling. And while I'm showing y'all my favorite specialty Christmas ice cream. A friend that I've never. met sent me this scoop, this ice cream scoop. If something happened to. this, I would cry like a baby. I put this under just the. hottest water I can get out of my faucet and I turn it over, and let it run on that for a few minutes. And you can see it's got a liquid in it, in the handle that kind of. helps it keep everything warm or cold, whichever you want. But thank you my friend for. sending me this ice cream scoop. It is literally the best ice. cream scoop I've ever had. All right. Let's see what it says. www.thatinventions.com. Scoop, what does that say Eddy? I gotta watch my chocolate,. or I'm going to have a mess. Y'all just, if you're an ice cream eater and I tell y'all what,. Michael and I eat a bowl of ice cream every night of our lives before we go to bed. We just look so forward to. Michael will be watching. TV in another room and he'll come in and. walk into the kitchen and look and see what's out and around. Have you had ice cream yet? And he acts like he gets pure mad if I have eaten my ice. cream and not called him to come in and get his,. but this is so good. And this is a premium. Publix brand of ice cream. I'll be back to you tonight. Love, love. I wish I could be that in. love with carrots or celery. Why does it have to be ice cream? All right. It's starting to get melted y'all. It's still got some chunks in it. I just want to make sure that. it's not touching the bottom. I don't think it is. You know, probably most of y'all have a actual double boiler, you know, that came with maybe your kitchen ware or something like that. But if you don't have one, this works very, very well. to just use a glass bowl and a pot that fits your. glass bowl properly. So you don't have to go. out and buy anything. This will work just fine. Okay, we're almost there. Okay, that's melted and. it's beautiful y'all, it's real smooth. And now I'm going to. add like two teaspoons of peppermint extract. Now just use your imagination. when you're making something like this, and create. it any way you want to. You know, I think nuts. would be good in this. So just think about it. I think raisins would be good in it. So just let your imagination run wild. So in goes our peppermint pieces. So we're just going to stir that up. I mean this is super simple. And coming up, I'm going. to share some other recipes that I think are. wonderful for gift giving. And we're going to talk. about compound butters. So now we're just gonna flip this over. So I'm trying to go against,. or go with the roll. All right. I'm going to get a little spray, and then we'll spray. the back of my spatula. So hopefully none of this will stick. And we're just going to spread this out, and then we're going to. stick it in the refrigerator. And let it get cold again. All right, I'm going to. have to slip to the one that I prepared Eddy. See it works much better if you spray it. And you can make this. as thick as you want, or as thin as you want. Just depends on how much. rubbing you want to do to it. Do you like yours thick or thin Eddy? - [Eddy] I think I like a thin. - [Paula] Okay, somehow I. knew you would say that. He wants to see me do more. work doesn't he y'all? All right. Okay I'm gonna get this. over here where I can. - [Eddy] Smells so good. - [Paula] Doesn't it smell delicious that peppermint extract? Can you imagine this with. a bowl of that ice cream? - [Eddy] Mhm. You might crinkle some of that up. - [Paula] I know, I know. Speaking of crinkle and. sprinkling, all that good stuff. Do you think, is it getting. thin enough for you yet Eddy? - [Eddy] Yeah it looks good. I'll just eat the outside pieces. - [Paula] Aha. (Paula laughs) Yeah. Okay here we go. Here we go. Let's do something that. I've never done before when I was making bark, but what the heck? Let's try it. You know if it messes up,. I'll keep it and eat it. I got some sprinkles. So let's just sprinkle. it and see what happens. - [Eddy] That's some green. - [Paula] That's pretty. Ain't that pretty y'all? - [Eddy] Mhm. - [Paula] All right, so now. let's add some more red. So say you really can, just. whatever your imagination, just use it, use it and be creative. Oops, I dropped some. right over there Eddy. Hear that peppermint? It's good. So I'm going to take this out and put it in the big refrigerator outside in the garage, and I'll probably leave it for about 45 minutes. And then we'll break it up, and we gonna put it in our. pretty little gift boxes. You know, there must be a lot. of folks out there that are in cookie swaps or gives. homemade things for gifts, because they have so many of these, like at the dollar store. - [Theresa] That's where I. got those, the dollar store. - You know, pay a dollar for them. And this one, I love this one. That Theresa picked up because. you can see through it. You can see what you're getting. - [Theresa] I knew you. would like the open one. - Yes. All right, so Theresa,. would you like to take that since you're closest. to that refrigerator? And after it hardens, I'll come back and I'll fill these gift. boxes and just show y'all, you know kind of what it looks like. And then like I said,. we're going to be talking about other great gift ideas. that come from your kitchen, and from your heart. Okay, our candy is ready, our peppermint candy with the red and the green speckles. Now, all I'm going to. do is just break this up into what I feel like is edible sizes. You know, some people may. like half this cookie sheet, but I'm just going to do it in. what I think is doable sizes. Now I have parchment. paper that comes in a roll so you can cut any size you need. So I cut me a square of parchment paper, and naturally we wash. these containers y'all, you don't want to put any type of food that you're giving away or even keeping. You don't want to put them in a container that has not been washed. So I'm using, oh my. gosh this is so pretty. And it takes no time y'all to get it hard, and I love the sprinkles. on it, don't you Eddy? - [Eddy] Yeah it looks great. - It really kind of perked it up. So now, I'm going to see if. our cover will go on with the parchment paper. And I think it would work,. that sealed up pretty good. And just kind of cramp it up. Put a little bow on it. And you're going to make. somebody very, very happy. - [Theresa] Me. - [Paula] Theresa said her y'all. - [Eddie] The lid with. the clear top looks nice. - [Paula] Yeah isn't that nice? You got fingerprints on it so. If I had taken my time I'm. sure I can get a prettier piece of tissue paper, or you. know what you could do, you could use the real tissue paper 'cause it's much thinner. That would be pretty too. But I know that Jamie Deans. teachers would have loved this as a gift. So Merry Christmas y'all. And I will be back with more. ideas for homemade gift giving. As soon as I get through with this bark. So good. Would you like a piece of my bark Eddy? - [Eddy] Yes. - Please. So good. Theresa, would you like some? Or are you taking the whole thing home?";['postres']
wJpAjNS1DMI.json;- Hey all it's Jamie Dean. here at my momma's house, and I've got some awesome. recipes for you today. My son Jack is here. He's had a half day at. school and it is fall season. So we're doing fall recipes today. It's also football season. and it's football season and it's football season. and it's football season. - [Teresa] And baseball. - Yeah and baseball, Braves captured the national league division championship. We're going to, divisional. championship a few days ago. So fall means a lot of things. And pumpkin is one of those. things that people love. So today we're doing pumpkin bars. This is a super easy recipe. It reminds me of so many things that I've cooked at mom's house and in our restaurant. We love dessert bars. So since it is that time of. year, we're going to do pumpkin. And this is a really easy recipe. And should I tell them. Teresa, the measurements, or are you going to. put a graphic up later? - [Teresa] They like the. measurements Jamie, so. - Okay, well I'm going. to have to read them. It's four eggs, all right. We have one and two third. cups of granulated sugar. We have one cup of vegetable oil and a 15 ounce can of pumpkin mix. So then we're going to mix. all these things together. I'll start with the sugar, get our oil in there. Let me see, said the blind man, pumpkin. On this house is decorated. this year on the inside, there's a giant spider. hanging over Jack's head. - [Teresa] I'm going to show. them that for just a second. - [Jamie] I love the. out of style decoration. All right, our pumpkin. So let's go four eggs. This little can here is. convenient, if y'all, I love to keep a little. garbage bowl on the counter, so I don't have to make a. million trips to the trashcan and this empty can is perfect. Rinse my hands real quick. We're going to mix this on low. We don't want to create a huge mess, so let's get it started on a low speed. We're going to make. this until it kinda gets everything incorporated. (high pitched sound) Beautiful. I mean, that is a fall deserve. We got working right here. Okay, now our dry ingredients y'all, are two cups of flour that we have sifted, two tablespoons of baking powder, two teaspoons of cinnamon, one teaspoon of salt. And we have two teaspoons of baking soda. Now for this, I'm just going to mix. it with regular spoon to get all this incorporated together. And then we're going to slowly. add our dry into our wet. We're going to do that at a low speed too. We want to get it. You don't want any flour clumps. So let's turn our beaters on low. It's a pretty high low. I'm going to go a little bit at a time. Okay, y'all you see I've got. it going pretty good in there. Take some care right. here around the edges. Get your rubber spatula. and make sure you get all that dry stuff down there. So I'm going to clean the edge of my bowl, making sure there's, y'all know when you got the hand mixer, sometimes there's a part of the bowl that you just some reason don't get to. So I'm going to get all that together. - [Teresa] That looks fabulous. - [Jamie] Yup, It's really pretty. Give it a couple more turns. And that's it. And y'all know when you see me here, you can count on simple,. delicious recipes. Cause Lord knows I got a wife. and three kids and two dogs and 14 jobs and there's never. enough time do anything. I had to tell Teresa,. when I got here today, I can only do half the work. she wants me to do because number one needs some things, number two need some things, number three needs some things. And the mama number one one, real one needs some things. So we've got an eight. by 10 container here. - [Teresa] That's a number 13 my friend. - [Jamie] Number 13. That's what I said. Roll back the tape. I'm going to get this down in here. Look how pretty this is. Y'all this time of year, we've had the lady in signs. for over 30 years now. And this time of year, we made more pumpkin. book gooey butter cakes than you could ever imagine. So that's a regular. gooey butter cake recipe, but you put a can of pumpkin in the top. And I used a spice cake mix for the base and it is really good. So that's a bonus recipe for you today. - [Teresa] Hey why don't we. have the spice cake next. That's a nice little, that is famous. - A spice cake mix on the bottom and a can of pumpkin in your top will give you a pumpkin gooey butter cake, which is this time of the year, it is really a super. fantastic popular dessert. Okay y'all this is it. It is almost time to enjoy. some fresh pumpkin bars. This is going into the oven. at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. So when you get back, I'll have dessert. Okay y'all our pumpkin bars. have come out of the oven. You gonna want to completely cool this because this icing that. we're going to put on there, it's going to be a little. thick and if it gets hot, it's going to melt and. it's going to be a mess. So as you could see, some of you with a keen eye might notice, how, why is the light different today? And how did he shave? I went to all the trouble. to wear this shirt that I was wearing yesterday, when I started this recipe, I'm so busy, to finish it today. And then I spoiled the illusion by telling you this is two different days. It's the magic of TV y'all, Magic of TV stands for. baloney most of the time. So this is the second day. This is completely cold. Oh, I just messed it up too, because I touched with my. hands, but that's all right. So the, the, the, the icing. for this is really simple, super healthy and good for you too. One entire package of cream cheese, one stick of butter. Are y'all with me? And we're going to cream this together. As soon as I plug in this,. we're going to do this. Stay with me, here we go. Okay, so we're going to cream. together, our cream cheese, and our stick of butter. This is softened butter. Watch your fingers when you're doing this. Remember I'm a professional. Then we're going to slowly. add our powdered sugar. And to this, we're going to add one. teaspoon of vanilla extract. Voila. As you could imagine, this icing is delicious. I'm telling y'all, do not put this on your. pumpkin bars while it's hot. It will be the biggest mess in the world. The great thing about these bars is it is a fall season recipe. So you can start enjoying these, as early as you want to. call it fall and as late as, Well, who cares have him at Christmas. This would be a really nice dessert to have at your Thanksgiving this year. Who doesn't love pumpkin bars. And you gotta be careful,. you see what I'm doing. If you push down too hard. and pull it too hard, you'll pull the top off of. your cake and I don't want that Push and pull. If you, if you're not careful and you start moving this around, you can pull the whole. top layer of your bars off because it is a delicate top. Push and pull and push and. pull and push and pull. I see you, I see you, I see you. - [Teresa] I think it's the amount of. - [Jamie] Oh I see you. - [Teresa] The icing on the bottom. - [Jamie] You know the. great thing about my mom It has always been this way, for the most part of television show, but I think perfect. But sometimes, you'll see that even the people that. - [Teresa] Do it all the time. - [Jamie] Run into the same. challenges that you all will. I wonder if it, maybe I. should have put a little. A little spray or something on my special so that the cream cheese wouldn't stick. But you know what, as I love to say, the dog will never complain. So you just have fun cooking and if your doesn't turn out, give it to your dog. - [Teresa] Oh, this is going to turn out, I can already tell. - [Jamie] Yeah. - [Teresa] I'm not real worried about the. - [Jamie] I'ma leave it be. What I should've done, was used a little bit smaller spreader. I was a little, got a little overboard with that spreader. My mom would have stood. here with a butter knife and done it all slowly. Instead, I dumped the whole thing on top, right at the beginning. So let's give it a test. drive what do y'all say, we'll start down here on the ugly end. Say, what are we going to do here? I think we'll do like, like a brownie size. I do love a corner. Let's see what kind of little. tool momma got over here. This looks good. Whatever this thing is. - [Teresa] Ooh, look how moist that is. - [Jamie] What y'all think, looks pretty dadgum good. So, y'all get going, cause Thanksgiving is coming. I hope you enjoy this. I hope you enjoyed the video. Thanks y'all, I'll see. you around the kitchen.;['postres']

wSaU5_SYDxI.json;- Hey everybody, I'm Bobby Deen. Thanks for tuning in. I'm standing in for my. mom while she recovered from an eye surgery that she. had up at Duke University as all of you know and. she's doing real well. So, thanks for the well wishes. In the meantime, I am going to show you some. recipes that you've asked for. We know what some of your favorites are and you'd like to see them. maybe lightened up a little bit. So, this is a perfect time to do that because that's exactly what I do. And I hosted a show for a few years that was based completely on. taking traditional recipes and lightening them up. And I also wrote a book about that show and about those recipes and we put a lot of them together. And so today, we're gonna. make a banana pudding. It's something that you. all have been asking for quite a bit. And the one that you really, really like, that lots of people like, is called not yo mama's banana pudding. And oh boy, is it good. But let me tell you why. It's very good because it's. got lots and lots of milk, whole milk or two percent milk, cream cheese, a ton of sugar. and a ton of pudding in it. And it just is great. And oh my gosh is it heavy. Well, I figured out a. way to lighten it up. This is a little bit different. recipe, it's really simple. And I think it's a nice take on my mama. So what I want you to do is I want you to make my mom's. natural mama's banana pudding and enjoy it. And then I want you to make mine and sort of compare the two. So, let's get started. We're going to use some. of the same ingredients, but we'll use less of them. Some we won't use it all like the cream cheese we won't use. Pudding, we won't use,. we'll make our own pudding. And so, let's get. started, see how it goes. We're gonna start over. here on the stove top with two and a half cups of milk. And sort of just a small sauce pan and here's my milk and quarter cup of sugar, and I'm just going to whisk. them together a little bit. I'll get my high going and I'm gonna turn it down to just to low. I'm just going to simmer it. I don't want to bring this to a boil. That's not the point. The point is to just simmer it. So, I'm gonna warm it really nicely and I'm gonna pay attention to it while it's over here and just make sure that. nothing bad happens. So while that's warming up, let's move back over. here to the countertop and we are going to. whisk together another... I'm sorry, I think I said a. quarter cup of sugar over there. It's a half cup. Or no, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's a half cup of sugar total and I've got it broken into quarters. So, that was a quarter of my cup of sugar. And this is the other. quarter of my cup of sugar. I'm gonna combine that with cornstarch. Cornstarch didn't all come out. A little pinch of salt. and a couple of eggs. Those are all expected ingredients. You looking for all these. Little bit of salt, eggs, two eggs, whisk that together. And that's coming together quick and easy. This might be a little different. than what you'd expect. Most people, when you. make a banana pudding, you don't think well, let. me go to the stove top and warm something up. So what we're gonna to do is this banana pudding. is sort of in stages. We're gonna cook to start with, and then we're gonna let cool. and then cover and chill. And then we're gonna come. back and put it all together. So we might take a couple. of breaks here, but not yet. I'm gonna come back over and. whisk my milk and sugar here and make sure that this. does not boil again. You just want it to simmer. Okay, so this is nice and. warm, looks beautiful, but it's not boiling. That's the important part. We did not want to boil it,. we just wanted to warm it up. So now, we're going to take. this warm milk and sugar mixture and we're gonna slowly. whisk it constantly. So, we don't to scramble eggs here. Just sort of temporary, right? We're gonna constantly whisk as we add that hot milk and. sugar to our cold mixture here. Coming together just nice. Got that whisk together real well. Okay, here we go. I've got my hot and my cold mixed together and we're just gonna add everything. That's perfectly warm. and we're gonna add it right back into the sauce. pan on the stove top here. Thank you, didn't spill a drop. And we're going to do the very same thing. I'm gonna just turn on into. a real low simmer here. Well, what's going on here? Here we go. Okay, I'm just going to. turn it on to just low. I'm just going to whisk. it until it thickens up and becomes just right. All right, this looks great. And it's beginning to thicken. and get just about right. Why don't we take one more break. And when we come back, we'll move this over onto the counter top and let it cool down. Okay, so this is. definitely thick and bubbly and ready to remove from the stove top. So, let's go back over. here to the counter. That looks beautiful. And we're going to add to that just a little bit of butter,. tablespoon of butter, and about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I might be a shade under a. teaspoon, but that's all right. Yeah, that looks great. Mix in the butter and I'm. gonna let this sit here and go room temperature and then we are going to chill it. Okay, so we made our banana. pudding on the stove top and we let it cool in the. freezer for a little while. And here we are, let's put. our banana pudding together. So, we've got our pudding. we met on the stove top. We've got some fresh whipped. cream that I just made. We've got our bananas here. and some Nilla wafers, which I love and a banana pudding. - [Woman] It's very traditional. banana pudding, Bobby. - It's very traditional. banana pudding, mama, sure is. So for our bananas, everybody, I've gotten the bananas. already cut up here and they're in a bowl and. bananas will go brown on you. Like a lot of other fresh fruits when they're just sitting on the counter. So, I've sprinkled them. with some Fruit Fresh. And put a little water on. them and start them up. And that'll just keep. them from turning brown and that'll keep them. from turning brown too while they're in the banana pudding. So, that's a product that. you might want to use. All right, here we go. We're gonna to do this in layers. This is a great spoon. - [Woman] I know, I wanted you. to use it, I love that spoon. It's one of my favorites. - I might not have enough pudding. There's going to be a. shallow banana pudding cause it's in layers and the consistency of. that pudding is perfect. - [Woman] Yeah, it's just soft enough that it'll soak up in those cracks. - So, anybody who's. wondering how mama's doing? That's mama. - [Woman] Her mouth is still doing fine. - Right before we started, right before we hit the. little button on the camera. Mama said alright, now I'm gonna. stand up here and be quiet. And then she immediately started talking. Well, you did. You did, but that's okay. That's natural for you and my. man, Ed, is behind the camera. Ed, thank you so much for handling-- - [Woman] And don't forget. your audience members. - And don't forget my audience members. Thanks everybody for tuning in. You're right, mama. - [Woman] Eddy, show. everybody the audience-- - Oh, you're talking. about my live audience. - [Woman] Your live audience. - Yeah, I've got one live audience member. I've got one live audience member and she's sitting right. over there having lunch, waiting on dessert, I think. Doesn't that look nice? Okay, so one layer of pudding, one layer of Nilla wafers,. little more pudding. And now we're wondering. how we lighten this up. And we did that by using. a little less sugar and rather than heavy whipping. cream, we just went wider. But golly, I need-- - [Woman] You'll be fine. - It'll be good, But it's. going to be thin yet. - It's going to be thin. by the time you put your-- - My bananas on there. Nilla wafers are going to get just... Just right with the pudding. And my hands are clean,. everybody, just so you know. I wash my hands probably. more than a surgeon. - [Woman] You're so organized, I just throw them mine on, Bobby. I could borrow some patience from you. - Wow, thank you, Aunt Peggy. That's a very nice thing to say. Thank you very much. - [Woman] He might be a perfectionist. - Yeah, I might have some things that start with O and end in D. - [Woman] ACDC. - ACDC. No, that's not one of them. That's not one of the. things that I've got. I've got a few of their old. albums maybe on cassette, but I don't personally have ACDC. (laughing) - You know, I'm definitely a perfectionist and I definitely like things. really clean and organized and you know who hates that, my wife. Cause she doesn't have that at all. She's got the opposite of that. She's like just do it. Don't worry so much about it. Stop thinking. - [Woman] That's right cause it's all going in the same place. - That's exactly the truth. She is more right than. me, I can guarantee. All right, more pudding. - [Woman] Bobby, I think. you need the crackers, son. She's supposed to end with the pudding. - That's true... And I kind of just ended with the pudding, but you know what? I got distracted by some. little birdies over here talking to me about... I know you don't-- - [Woman] But I do think. I resemble that remark. - You do resemble it. - [Woman] And you know, Bobby,. when I make banana pudding, if the people are standing around that I'm making it for, I always ask do you like. more bananas or more cookies? - Auntie, do you like more. bananas or more cookies? See, that's my favorite kind. of audience member right there. That's my favorite kind of guests. - [Woman] Well, my preference. is more crackers than bananas. Cause that pudding-- - I should have used a smaller dish. I should have made a. little mini single serving. I should have made a. personal banana pudding. - [Woman] Bobby, this. is just like lasagna. Put those layers together. - Nobody after I finish. putting whipped cream on it-- - [Woman] Every one of those. bananas on top of that. And then your nice heavy. cream to cover them and not to keep them from. turning brown too, you know? - Well, if you want to step. in here and help me, you can. No, you don't? Everybody wants to know how mama is doing and she's doing just great. She had a little bit of. eye surgery up at Duke and man, I came in here today. Cause we're at mama's. house, it's not my house. I came in here today and mama. has got some pep in her step. She was having lunch and. her eye was opened up. And looking good and feeling good. And I'm happy to see that. Oh, today is... Let me say this. Today is my daddy's birthday. - [Woman] Is today the 19th? - Today is August the 19th. As you watch this, it probably. won't be August the 19th, but today is August the 19th. And that is my father,. my brother, Jamie and me, our daddy, Jimmy. Today's his birthday. And I spoke to him this. morning and that's good. And also, also, also my cousin, our cousin, Taylor Deen,. had her baby yesterday. - [Woman] I didn't know. she was pregnant, Bobby. Wow, well then that's a surprise to you. - [Woman] So, you know what? That makes Piggy Deen a great grandmother. Cause Taylor is her granddaughter. Oh, well wonderful. - So there's more Deens being born, but Taylor's married to a fellow. I think that her maiden. name is Garrison now. Let me rinse my hands off real quick. They're living down in. Auburn where we're from. So, Taylor and her husband. had their baby today and he's healthy or had. had their baby yesterday and the baby is healthy and all is well. And mama, what do you think? Should I put some more. Nilla wafers on there or no, just whipped cream, just cover. it all with whipped cream? - [Woman] I think I would. just spread that whipped cream all over the top. - I think so too, I think you're right. So, I'm just gonna plop it on this. - [Woman] Yeah, like those cookies. Soak up that custard. Bobby, I have to admit, I tasted and stuck a. finger in your custard. - I don't believe that. You cheated on some food and tasted it with your fingers. right to your mouth, no. Who would ever have suspected that? - [Woman] And your custard tastes so much like your grandmother's. And I'm talking about your. grandmother hires my mother. It tasted so like hers. - Well good, I'm sure. that that is a compliment. Well that's all right. We'll just kind of... It leaves a little bit to be seen. So, that adds to the... You can see what's down there that you're gonna get. when you spoon into it. So you can get sort of. excited about it in advance or maybe I can sort of make it, sorry. Sorry about that, I forgot for a second. I forgot for a second that you were having to. try to keep up with me. - [Woman] I like mine to look like a pie. You know how you have all. those pretty peaks on it? - Well, we don't have that. - [Woman] And there's. your clean paper towel and wipe your bowl, clean. the edges of your bowl with. And do I need to go out to the garden and get you some fresh mint? - [Woman 2] You don't need to go out. - My customer? My one long customer is going to go out and gather some fresh mint. - [Woman] We're not going. need that mint anyway, are we? - She's going to go get. it, she's insistent. All right, so that looks like about good. All right, so we've. topped our banana pudding. A quarter of it has disappeared. Somebody got into it and now-- - [Woman] You got a rat in the kitchen. - I got a rat in the kitchen. I'm just told by the rat. A rat just told me that I got a rat, but the good news is I heard. that the banana pudding is very good. - [Woman] It's wonderful. If it had a little writing on it, it would be just like mama's. Bobby, remember when I. used to make banana pudding every day for the bag lady and. putting it on styrofoam cups. Oh, our customers... Our customers adore it,. that banana pudding. - Everybody. So, that was a lighter. version of banana pudding. You will love the recipe. I'm sorry, but this is. where it comes from. So, I gotta plug it. This is not my mama's banana pudding and this is from my book and oh boy, is that a good recipe. So, thanks for tuning in. And while mama is on the. end you will be seeing me. So, I'll be back to do some more. If you've got some requests or some foods that you really like and you. want to see lightened up, let us know and we'll do them. So for now, signing off. - [Woman] Bon appetit, y'all.;['postres']

wwBokb6LI6Y.json;- Christmas is just not Christmas unless there are some gingerbread. men cookies around, right? They just scream, scream Christmas. And one of my business. acquaintance mother-in-law makes the best gingerbread. cookie in the world. And I did not ask her for the recipe. I kinda had a feeling she. might not want to share it. So this is the recipe. that I had on my website. So I'm still in search of the best gingerbread man cookies that I could ever hope to make. So this is my first shot at it. And I think I'll be able to improve on it as I work on these gingerbread cookies. So I make a lot of ginger cookies, but I just don't go to the, you know, to the actual gingerbread man and woman. All right. So we're going to start by creaming our dark brown sugar. with our stick of butter. And you know, it's kind of. the typical ingredients. And of course you can always change about your spices if you want to. If you like them with. a real ginger flavor, add more ginger, if. you like more cinnamon, add more cinnamon, and the same goes for your nutmeg. And what was that other one. that I didn't have put in here, all spice? So, just kind of play around with it. Do what suits your tongue. Okay. I am just slowing this down. until I get it under control. - [Eddie] And if you do. want the cookie to be, so firm like the gingerbread, - Yes. - [Eddie] Would you add more molasses to make it a little more chewy? - Actually, I would just put one egg in it because the more eggs you put, the more cake like it is. And I'm not really fond of. cookies that are cake like, you know what I mean? I like them crispy and some chewy, you know, in the center, that's kind of the way I like 'em. All right, I'm gonna. transfer this to a big bowl because after I get all this mixed up, I'm going to be adding. our flour mixture to it. Yeah. I'll be in search of that. wonderful gingerbread cookie that I have dreamed about. And I guess it's been,. what, maybe four years, five years, Theresa? - [Theresa] Gosh, longer than that. - Since Jeff's mother-in-law made those and shared with us. Mm, they were so good. All right, cream, cream, cream. (mixer hitting side of bowl) All right, now I'm going to add two eggs. I wish I wasn't adding but one, but we're gonna go with what I said the first go round. (mixer hitting sides of bowl) All right, now I'm going. to add our molasses. Now this is molasses, it's not syrup. Molasses kind of looks like motor oil. It's real dark and real sweet. And then we're gonna take our flour. (mixer hitting sides of bowl) And add it to this mixture. To our creamed mixture. I'm going to take this. and scrape my bowl down. There we go. I'd love it if some of the grandchildren would come in to help us decorate these gingerbread men and women. Maybe they will. (mixer hitting sides of bowl) Maybe somebody'll show up. Okay. All right, I'm going to come over here, and we've got our flour, and I'm adding salt, baking soda? Don't remember if it was soda or powder. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. I love ginger. Every time I say it, Michael. hears me say I love ginger, you know what he says? Well, actually I liked Mary Ann the best. He's so goofy. So, I wanna just kind. of sift this together using our little magic whisk. All right. So, this is a little. high for me to work with, but I think y'all can see better. Okay, so I'm just gonna. work, stir this flour in. You know, you can use. a spoon or a spatula, and then, we've got to put. this in the refrigerator y'all. And let it set until it's firm enough that we can roll it out and cut it. Do our cutting out with. our cookie cutters. You know what, I said. to do it with a spoon, but I'm actually gonna finish. this off with my mixer. And when you roll these out, you're going to want to make sure that you roll them on a surface that's well floured so they won't stick. And don't worry about them looking. Don't worry about the fact that. you put down too much flour and they gonna look white. because that will bake out. So don't worry about that. Just make sure you have enough flour so they won't stick. Okay, so there it is. Our ginger bread dough. Smells pretty good. It almost smells like sweet potatoes. Come smell, Theresa, see if this doesn't smell. like a sweet potato to you. - [Eddie] I can smell the molasses. - You can. Smell, smells just like a sweet potato. - [Theresa] It does at first. - Doesn't it. - [Theresa] I catch another. - So that's it. We're going to put these. in the refrigerator, and then we're going to roll them out and cut them and throw them in the oven. And hopefully somebody. will come help me decorate. I think I forgot to. mention this part, y'all, but we need to work with maybe about a half a cup of dough at the time, because if you try to work. all that dough at once, it's really overpowering. So we're gonna. And remember what I've. told you about the flour. It's okay. And after this sits in. the refrigerator, y'all, it's like hard as my arteries. It's hard. So if you got a big, strong man around. Put him to work. I don't like mine real thick. All right, here we go. First the girl because it's. ladies first, remember. Always ladies first. Can see her little skirt. Now you can find these cookie cutters in different sizes. These are kind of rather. on the smaller side. I kind of like the larger ones because when you go to decorate 'em, the smaller your surface, the harder it is to work with. And I done chopped off. a piece of his foot. There it is. We just go hook it right. back on there, little man. Just hook it right back. Okay. You know, children have so much fun decorating cookies at Christmas time. I know my grandboys just love it. And Jack's 14 now. And you know, he still enjoys getting in the kitchen with his grandma and making cookies. Jack likes to bake. So I will see if I can't work this up. I may mix this in with. the rest of the batter that I've gotten the refrigerator. It's still chilling, and see if we can't get. some more gingerbread people out of there. But these are going to get, It's getting towards the. end of the day, y'all I'm going to put these in the oven. Let me see, at 350, and bake 'em for about 10 minutes. That's kind of the standard. average number for cookies isn't it? 350, 10 minutes. - [Theresa] Yep. - So that's what we gonna. do with these little babies. And you can rework this dough. And like I said, I think it'll, I think if I mix it with some that's not been flowered yet, I think it'll work real good. So in the oven, 350, 10 minutes, and I can tell y'all something right now. Who's gonna decorate the most beautiful gingerbread man and gingerbread girl ever. Your cameraman, the. college graduate from SCAD, Savannah art and design school. He will beat us all by. far with his decorating. But I'm still gonna try. Okay, listen mister artiste has already done a few, and I want you to see how pretty they are. Aren't they pretty? - [Theresa] Well pick 'em. - [Paula] Oh, pick them up. - [Theresa] Well just show them. - I love this one because. it's got so much icing. She's got a little white flowery dress. - [Eddie] Oh that's a snowman. - No this is a missus. - [Eddie] Yeah, but I made. the other side a snowman. I made it look like a snowman. - Where? - You don't think it looks like a snowman? - No, I just saw the skirt. You know what? It can be anything you want it to be. And I love the fact, Eddie, that you used the candy balls for eyes 'cause it's hard to get that small amount. - [Theresa] So what you doing? - So I'm going to copy you.

wWNqdXz8e2A.json;hey y'all I'm Paula Deen and today I'm making pies whether you're in the mood for something savory or something sweet I've got the perfect pie to please any palate first up it's my chicken pot pie that's so rich and creamy that it could only be called the lady in sons and then next is a sinfully wonderful white-chocolate macadamia-nut pie and then finally it's my mystery pecan pie with a perfectly Paula surprise inside so I hope you brought your appetite coz it's time to fill up on a day of decadence Michael Michael I got a I gotta run the store I'll be back in a little bit girls guess what time it is it's shopping time one more trip to kitchen caboodle whenever I want a little something special to use in my kitchen I'm sure to visit kitchen caboodle it's a great place to go because you never know what you're gonna find there they have everything from helpful cooking gadgets to beautiful serving dishes to well who knows like this great little pi marker it makes preparations on top of your pie for you to come along so you never have to worry about who's gonna get the biggest piece I'll have to add this to my shopping cart today but what did I come here for again oh yeah some pretty plates for my pies and hmm I wonder if they have something here to send a pie in you know I could browse all day in this store but I better get back to the kitchen if we're gonna get all those pies done in time thanks Janice you always have such a great selection I know y'all probably think that I stay at kitchen caboodle but I tell y'all what I just do love that little store and I want you to go find some pretty plates but my pies because that's what today's show is about it's all about pies look at that beautiful plate and I got some other stuff down in here that I'm gonna be talking to y'all in a little bit about so in the meantime I'm gonna be making the lady and Sons chicken pot pie once a week I used to make old timey chicken pot pie and everybody loved it but I wanted one that was delicious and also pretty so I came up with this one and I'm using some boneless chicken breasts that I've cut into cubes and we're gonna saute that in about a third of a stick of butter I'm gonna put this in the sink I wanted to get rid of that bowl because I didn't want to forget that I'd had raw chicken in it you want to be very very careful and make sure you use clean utensils and wash your hands after handling poultry all right so I'm gonna put a little salt in this a little seasoning salt and a little black pepper and I'm gonna come back over here and check our puff pastry it's a great product but we're gonna take our sheet of puff pastry all right now I'm gonna just slice through that just like that this is such a wonderful product so what we're gonna do is lay out our dough and we're gonna lattice this you want to make sure that your crust is gonna fit the bowl that you're using so I think about four lattices will work now I'm gonna take every other strip and I'm gonna come in here and lattice this and it doesn't have to be perfect because I found that imperfections is really pretty and it gives it a little interest in the shape all right so we've got the top to our pie and you see how easy that was now I'm gonna brush this so it'll have a pretty shiny top at the restaurant we just used one whole egg and we beat up so yolk and the white and this will give it a pretty glazed look it'll be nice and shiny and pretty and brown okay so we're gonna put this in the oven and bake this off all right so we're gonna let that bake off a few minutes and now we're gonna turn around and come back to our pot of chicken which is looking good so I'm gonna go ahead and add some onion to that oh my gracious that's strong and garlic all right I'm gonna sprinkle this with flour no I think about two tablespoons that flower is gonna help produce a nice rich stock alright so now I'm gonna take heavy cream and you could use milk or half and half but at the restaurant we use heavy creaking a little bit more you see I'm trying to slowly add in that alright so we're just gonna let that simmer and I've got some sautéed carrots that still got a little crunch to it and these are just frozen green peas I wouldn't use a canned pea now we're gonna have some chicken flavor but we're not gonna have quite as much as I would like so I'm gonna help it along by using a chicken base and you can actually buy this product at the grocery store now it's in the soup section actually now you'll want to be careful with this product though because contains a tremendous amount of salt so you'll want to be very careful that you don't put too much salt in your pot pie and I'm gonna finish it off with just a little nutmeg it's amazing what fresh nutmeg does for cream sauces all right now I'm gonna turn around here and check on our pie crust I've got one over here that's ready and you see how there's so much butter in that puff pastry that it can't hardly stay on that pan how pretty that looks and I'm gonna see if this one's ready yet oh yeah it's nice perfect it's perfect I'm just gonna stack it up right there with the other one okay this is ready you see I've got it hot and bubbly so you could make this the day before the morning of and put it in the refrigerator and then just come back and heat it up and it's just amazing that you can have this kind of meal in what 15 to 20 minutes just amazing and remember now when you're making your pie you want to make sure that you bake this off in an oven proof dish I'm gonna bring this up here and I want to clean it off just a little bit and then we're just going to take our latticed puff pastry shell and we're just gonna sit it up on our pie and we're gonna do a little push down on it I want that rich creamy sauce to kind of bubble up and adhere to that crust I'm gonna throw these in the oven and when we come back I'm gonna share with you my cousin Johnny's white macadamia nut pie that's over the top [Music] [Music] alright those pies are looking good but I'm gonna give them just a couple of more minutes in the meantime we're gonna turn around here and we're gonna make one of my cousin Johnny's specialty pies now Johnny owns a bakery called Gabriel's bakery and Marietta Georgia and I asked Johnny I said you know I won't I want the favorite recipe of your husband's cuz I really wanted this to be a man pleaser so she said this one's yet polish so we're gonna start off by making a ganache I've put some semi-sweet dark chocolate chips in the bowl and I'm gonna heat up some heavy cream now I'm not gonna bring this to a bowl but while that's heating up I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna put my sugar just a granulated sugar and I'm gonna add some softened cream cheese I'm gonna beat the cream cheese and the sugar together in the meantime our chips are in the bowl and we're gonna pour our hot cream over that and we're just gonna stir those just like that and you see how quickly you have ganache there's nothing to it just a fancy word for something very very simple all right I'm just gonna set that to the side now and let it cool because we're fixing to get to the really good part of this time I think this pie might be a man catcher you know what I mean girls all right I'm gonna add some heavy cream that hasn't been whipped just gonna add it very very slowly this is a real rich all right now I'm gonna fold in some heavy cream that's been whipped we're just gonna fold that in by going to the bottom of the bowl with our spatula and coming up on the other side because we don't want it to break down on us okay and then we're gonna fold in our macadamia nuts I've got some wonderful fresh orange zest oh and it smells so good and strong we're gonna just fold that in and now we're gonna fold in the best part and that's the melted white chocolate oh gosh I could eat that just like that all right we're just gonna fold that in hi Gertie girl I can't believe you don't wait 200 pounds and I can't believe I don't wait three all right that looks out of this world all right so all we're gonna do now is put that in a prepared pie crust that's been baked off oops and speaking of pies I smell chicken pot pie that's what you're smelling eating it Gertie look at these beautiful pies I'm just gonna sprinkle it just like I do at the restaurant with a little fresh chopped parsley and a couple of spoons for eatin oh they look so good all right so we're gonna come back over here to our pie and this has been baked off and we're just gonna fill our pie crust with this delectable filling okay this one's ready to go into the freezer and I've got another one in here that's actually ready watch it ready it's all ready for the ganache this is sinful looking all right now I'm gonna do this kind of slow and gentle I'm putting this warm chocolate ganache over sugaring cream cheese and macadamia nuts and my gracious now just when you think this pie is done it ain't I'm gonna put some whipping cream on it but before I do that I'm actually gonna taste these pies these chicken pot pies I think they've cooled enough for me to taste them and they look just too good and this is the way I like to eat mine I like to break off that little edge and get in there and chase it [Music] I can see why it's a favorite at the restaurant I just love it just when y'all think it couldn't get any better y'all come right back because I'm gonna finish up this pie and then I'm gonna make a mystery pecan pie that's unforgettable [Music] okay I've got some whipped cream in the pastry bag and I'm gonna just pipe some whipped cream onto our pie I actually let that ganache kind of chill all right now I'm gonna just sprinkle it with a few extra nuts and I'm gonna pop this back in the freezer so to my sorry I don't get to taste it right now but I'm gonna get to it in the next 10 minutes oh it looks delicious all right pecan pies I know you've probably all had a pecan pie but I've got a new pecan pie recipe for y'all and this was sent to me from a friend from New Orleans all right now I've got three eggs busted I'm gonna add some sugar and I'm gonna add some white corn syrup now a lot of people use white corn syrup for the pecan pies a lot of people use a dark corn syrup to me it doesn't too much make a difference as long as this syrup in it you're just gonna whisk this around it doesn't have to be beat up to to good all right and I'm gonna add the vanilla all right this is our syrup layer and this is gonna be the surprise layer that's in this pecan pie and we're gonna start with cream cheese a little bit more sugar a little salt to cut the sweetness you know what I mean a little more vanilla and one more egg and we're just going to incorporate that together a pecan pie is great for beginner so if you want to surprise the family pull this recipe out on them and see what happens all right now we're gonna add our cream cheese to the bottom of the pie looks like melted white chocolate doesn't it just kind of smear that around evenly here we go now I'm using a chopped pecan you can use a whole one but it makes it much much easier to slice by the piece when your nuts are chopped up like this one so you have to decide what you want all right now this is the standard filling right here for a pecan pie all we're gonna do is take this and pour it on top of those nuts and then when this pie is done all the nuts will have risen to the top now if I can just get it to the oven without spilling it and you can see that I'm gonna bake this in a raw pie shell because this times actually gonna bake for about 45 minutes so you don't want to pre-bake your shower it would get too Brown I got it in there without spilling it so we couldn't come over here and check on this one oh my gracious look how good that looks I'm actually gonna put it over here in this corner cuz I got a great breeze coming in that door so I'm gonna let that sit right there and cool and now I'm fixing to go get that white-chocolate macadamia-nut pie out and sample it to make sure it's good enough for my family and friends and I'm gonna see what yeah look at it goose and Daniel it almost looks like it's got a heartbeat Johnny I think you got you a winner baby girl nice thing that I think a little bit more cream is in order and a little bit more nuts let's see what we got I swear it'll make you sassy oh mama you know hang around because when we come back I'm gonna give you some tips on shipping that pecan pie just somebody that you love [Music] half the fun to me of making pies is sharing them with people that I love and there's no better pie to share with folks than the pecan pie it's one of the sturdiest of all the pies remember when I walked in at the opening of the show and I had a paper bag full of stuff well this is one of the things that I had in there so what I'm gonna do is just drop that pie down into the bottom half of that container and I'm gonna take some parchment paper and I'm gonna seal this lid in there really really good and I'm gonna tape back down that will help keep it secure in the bottom of that container all right what we're gonna do now is we're gonna use what they call a peanut and all I'm gonna do is tuck the pie down in here and then I'm gonna put the peanuts back on top of it so it won't allow that guy to move around and I even made some tags off of the computer to go on this and you see that it reads best dishes from my kitchen to yours so be sure and go to your computer and make your little labels these work out great I had a wonderful time with y'all today making all these recipes Inc I hope y'all will try some of these recipes I hope you love them in fact look at that mystery pecan pie have you ever seen a pecan pie with cream cheese in it neither have I I know you're gonna love it and as always I send y'all love and best dishes from my kitchen to yours Oh

X8tqFzkUBMU.json;"- Who loves cinnamon rolls? Oh my gosh. I love 'em. And when I make 'em with yeast and all that, you know, it takes so long. And I was readin' this little recipe in somebody's magazine. It wasn't mine but it was in a magazine and it was an easy cinnamon roll that you actually cook in the air fryer. So I said, ooh, that's a double winner. So I'm gonna be usin''''' crescent rolls. They recommend crescent rolls. And I'm gonna add 1/3. of a cup of brown sugar and about 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1/3 of a cup of powdered sugar. And I'm gonna mix this together with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. So this is gonna make our crescent rolls. It's gonna turn our crescent rolls into cinnamon rolls. I adore a cinnamon roll with all that ooey gooey icing on top. You know, when Eddie and I was out there flyin' a lot before COVID oh my gosh, we'd be in the airports. And those, you know what. cinnamon rolls I'm talkin' about. You could get extra goop on top. Oh my goodness. It was so hard for me to walk by those and not get one. But I didn't get 'em, did I Eddie? - [Eddie] No - Maybe once. - [Eddie] Maybe you did. (laughing) - Maybe once but you know, I could've got one every. time I walked by one but I didn't. But not 'cause I didn't want it. - [Eddie] Well I know in Minneapolis depending on which- - Yes. - [Eddie] Terminal we were in. - We were in. - [Eddie] There was one. that was worth going to though because it had that bakery in it. And they had the best. cinnamon rolls there. - Oh gosh, that's what we miss. about Minnesota, isn't it. All right. Let's see. I want to make sure I get this right. So combined butter, brown. sugar, cinnamon, and salt. And it just calls up an. 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt. So that would probably be an eighth. And now it said spread. butter mixture over dough, leaving a fourth of an inch border. Alright, now let's see what we do with the cream cheese, okay. Calls for cream cheese, but. that goes in that yummy icing. All right. So we got that mixed up good. So I'm going to open my Crescent Rolls. This thing always scares. me, if it pops before I mean for it to pop. Great dime a day, I don't. think they wanted me to get into this. Okay. So we're gonna to unwrap. the rolls and you can see I put a little flour. down so they won't stick And I may need a little bit more flour, 'cause I don't want. these puppies stickin'. So we want to just press these together So it'll make one long piece of dough. All right. Now it said spread. butter mixture over dough. All right. No let's back up. Roll out Crescent dough in one piece, pinch seams together and fold in half. Okay. So we will fold that in half. And we'll pinch it back together again. Now after I pick up. what their putting down, what that recipe is putting down. I may be changing this. a little bit. In fact, I am going to change some of it already. All right. And then what does it say to do? Pinch seams together and fold in half, roll dough into a nine by seven rectangle. Okay. So I'm going to. have to find my little, my little rolling pin. Here's my little handy dandy rolling pin. It's trying to stick together, isn't it? Now their recipe, I think. called for just a regular, an eight ounce tube of Crescent rolls. And I don't know what we'll. use, but we're using the jumbo, 'cause if I make cinnamon rolls I want to have as many as i'm. capable of making at one time. Okay. Does that look like what they say? A nine to seven, Eddie? - [Eddie] You've got your. little handy measuring tool on the side there. - Oh yeah. (laughing) Alright. I know, you know, this is my favorite. cuttin' board and it's, it's a Paula Dean cuttin' board Meyer made this for me years ago and it's got your pie circle, so you can figure out how, what size to make roll. out your pie crust to. Okay, so it said a nine by seven. Well, I can't, I can't, I don't know if I'll be. able to move it Eddie. - [Eddie] That looks about right. - Yeah. Like I say we've actually got more dough than their recipe had. All right, so now we are. gonna spread our cinnamon And sugar mixture, and we're gonna leave about. a half an inch border. I may need some more cinnamon and butter and sugar since we got more dough. I don't want no skimpy cinnamon roll. That'd be just enough. to make your mouth mad. Okay. Now here's where I'm. going to be a little different from their recipe. To me, a cinnamon roll. is not a cinnamon roll, unless it has nuts and raisins. So I am gonna to be adding that. Yeah, could of stood a. little bit more sugar. Couldn't I, Eddie? Maybe that would be enough.. They say leave how much? A fourth of an inch. So I've left more than. a fourth of an inch. So lets bring that out a little bit more. You know, if this turns out good, what an easy way to satisfy. a cinnamon roll cravin'. 'Cause once I know what I'm doing, this is going to be really, really easy. Okay. Now I've got to go stop and find my nuts and my raisins. This is the beauty of cooking, y'all. You have the ability to make it any way you want it. Express yourself. Does that look like enough nuts, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah that looks good. - I don't want to be. shy of no nuts either. All right here come these. wonderful raisins that just add a little bit more sweetness to it. I love raisins. I love raisins in my oatmeal. cookies and in my cinnamon rolls. So, I tell y'all make it, make it the way the recipe. has been given the first time. But you know, I've just been in the. kitchen long enough to know that I like nuts and raisins. So here we go. It said to start at the long, at the long side, roll up dough, like a jelly roll. Okay. Ooo this is going to be good. This is the way, I'm going to dampen that seam just a little bit to see if I can get it to seal a little bit better. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. I'm trying to bring all my. fillin' all the way to the end. I think we gonna have a good, right good cinnamon roll y'all. All right. Now let's see if they, let's see if they recommend. brushing it with an egg. No, they don't recommend. puttin' it with an egg. I mean, coatin' it with an egg. Ok. So they just tell us to cut, and make six cinnamon rolls. But I think we're gonna. get more than that because we used the larger Crescent dough. You do want to make sure that. you cut them all about the same size though. (Timer dings) Ooo, that tells me something is ready. Okay. Look at these. Y'all I got to. check something in the oven. Y'all talk amongst yourselves. And I think these are going. to probably cook beautifully y'all because you know how. good my biscuits bake in this. The biscuits are wonderful. Ooh, I'm so excited. A cinnamon roll in like 10 or 15 minutes. Yay. I could have rolled them. a little bit tighter, but, But I didn't have 'em. in the right position. You know, when I started rolling up, I should have turned it towards me and I would have had a. tighter, tighter roll. All right. I'm gonna give those a spray, And I'ma put them in our air fryer at 350, for 10 minutes. And I'll be checking those. because I don't know what kind of air fryer they were usin''''''', but I know it wasn't a Paula Dean, it was a kind of a small air fryer. So I'm gonna keep my eye on that. But while they're baking, I've got to make our top. to go on these hot cinnamon rolls. Because to me it's the best part. This is my first check y'all and they are looking good, but I'm going to cook them. You see I've, I'll cook in my air fryer.. I'll usually cook on like 400, but this recipe called for 350. So I'm bumping it up to 375. And I'm addin' another five minutes. So in your air fryer, if you have an air fryer or. you putting this in a regular oven, you'll just have. to play with that time until you get it right. Okay. So y'all saw what the cinnamon rolls looked like after 10 minutes, because I usually cook. on like 400 degrees, but I'm doing what the recipe. said and starting at 350, but I did bump it up to 375. and I added another five minutes. All right. So I'm going. to make that delicious, gooey topping that we love. so much on cinnamon rolls. Now the recipe calls for two. tablespoons of half and half, four ounces of cream cheese,. did it call for four ounces or three ounces? - [Theresa] Three ounces. - I added a good 'nother ounce because the recipe said it made six cinnamon rolls while mine may, because I was using the Grands, mine made 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. So I might need a little. bit more of the icing. So it called for a third. of a cup of powdered sugar. Well, I'm doin' a heaping cup. And I'm just (hand mixer motor sounds) All right, I'm gonna to. get a little vanilla. I don't know if it asks for vanilla but I'm coming out with my own vanilla spices And I can't wait to. share these with y'all. So this is vanilla paste. So I'm going to add just a little bit. You can see the paste is a. little thicker than vanilla, the regular vanilla flavoring. (Hand mixer motor sounds) Wow. Ooh. Look at these. Now, so in. our air fryer cooking it 350 degrees, these took 15 minutes, but had I been cooking them on 400 or 375? They might've gotten. done in three minutes. Ten minutes. All right. So Theresa,. I'm so excited about these I can't think. I can't think, do we have. a platter or something? I can take these out and put them on. - [Eddie] Yeah, right here on the (tongs clacking) - Oh, yay. - [Theresa] I was gonna. say ""You're asking me?"" I don't know where everything is yet. - Eddie moved this piece. into the kitchen y'all. This was actually in the. laundry room at River Bend for us to fold clothes on. And so Eddie said you just. need something else down here, so he put it in here and now I am, what is going on? And now I am so dependent on it. It's got to stay there forever Eddie. All right. So I'm going to take these out, put 'em on our platter. They look delicious. And remember I always recommend sprayin'. Your biscuits or any kind. of dough that you're making. All right. All right. Those in the front, I have found that in an air fryer, the food in the back. tends to cook not as fast. (background talking) So i'm going to take these and put them back in. just for a few minutes. Hey, you got it. All right. Here we go, the best part. - [Theresa] Those are really pretty. - Aren't they pretty? I'm just amazed that we can. have a cinnamon rolls so quick. Alright. Y'all want half or whole? - [Theresa] I want half. - Okay, any particular one? - [Theresa] Nope. (laughing) - Eddie, you want half or whole. - [Theresa] You know you want - Well Eddie's kinda been. watching what he eats - [Theresa] He's, I know. - Cause I've been watching. him. What he eats. - [Theresa] These are good. - Ain't nothing wrong with a quickie every now and again y'all. And that's pretty good for a quickie. Isn't that yummy? - [Theresa] Uh huh. - It's about as good as those. that you buy at the airport. (Eddie laughing) Nasty Michael, they got boogers. They got boogers in 'em. Michael? - [Michael] What? - Turn around, look at us. (laughing) - [Theresa] You've got. stuff all over your face. - Do I? Well, that's. what makes it so good. So I'm so glad I saw this recipe. - [Theresa] You made it your own. - Uh huh, yum. So next time and there. will be a next time. The next time I would need to. make these with no nuts and no raisins, so our little. toddlers can have one. I didn't think about that. I was just thinking. about big old fat Guinea. So do try this. It's worth it. Y'all Max is back in a diaper. He's up, he's back to his evil ways. He's pee peein', where. Pumpkin, the cat is been. So when he comes in here, he. has to have on his diaper. And I just had me a treat. I had the most wonderful cinnamon roll. (multiple people talking) Do you want that treat? Do you. want that treat little girl? You want it bad? You want it bad? Say I want it so bad I. can hardly turn over. (laughing) All right, everybody sit. - [Eddie] Max, sit. - You know I can't get. into these bags anymore. They make it so hard to get in 'em. Okay. Y'all just be patient. Be patient. My lil childrens. Can't do it. Can't do it. All right here. We'll try it this way. I'm gonna be over the, I got it! Alright, sit. Max you're such a good boy. All right here you go sweet girl. All right, my baby. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Oh my goodness. I feel like if I have a treat, they have to have a treat too.";['postres']
X9mF4bKak0E.json;- Hey, y'all. For years, there was this. little dessert that I made because it was so easy to. make if you were in a pinch, had company, and had. nothing planned for dessert. Well, we're gonna take. this super, super simple and delicious little, for. lack of a better word, we'll call it a trifle. We're gonna make it for Saint Patty's week because like the way they. turn the rivers green, we're gonna turn our whipping cream green. And I have started with two. cups of heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup of sugar, and we're gonna beat this until. it forms really nice peaks. So I know it's hard to. hear over this mixer, so I'll see you when it's ready. Okay. That is perfect, y'all. You can see it'll hold its shape, so that's just what we want. And I had two cups of heavy. cream, 1/2 cup of sugar, and about 1/2 teaspoon. of vanilla flavoring. So this whipped cream is delicious. So you talk about easy? Easy, easy, easy. Now if you really, really. want to make it good, start with a homemade chocolate chip. It would be wonderful. But you know what? The convenience and the swiftness of this recipe is just perfect with these chocolate chip. cookies and they chunks. (laughs) They like me, they chunks. (laughs) All right, before we do that, though, we gonna come back down. here to our whipping cream because we're using this to. celebrate St. Patrick's Day. So I'm using a gel food coloring and I don't want to overdo it, so I'm gonna start with a little, you know you can always add to, but you can't take that sucker. out once you put it in there. It's out. All right, so this gel. may take a little bit more than like the old timey, you. know, little squirt bottles. This reminds me of that pistachio fluff, you know, that we make, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah.. - Oh, it's so good. - I'ma give it one more little. squirt so people won't... They'll know it's supposed to. be green, not sick-looking. This gel is pretty 'cause see, you can do it like that. and not mix it up good and just let it swirl. But I'm gonna go ahead and. mix it all up in there. Okay, so we gonna come on over. You know, the grand part about this recipe is you can make it as big. or as little as you want to. We could actually make. it in a bowl this size, or we could make it in. a 13 by nine by two, or we could make it in. a large trifle bowl. So I'm gonna start by. putting a little spoonful of our beautiful sweetened whipped cream. And we just, look, see that. pretty streak in it right there? Can you see that, Eddie?. - Yeah. Through the glass?. - Mm-hmm. I think that's so pretty. All right, now we're gonna quickly dump our cookies down in milk. I mean, just that quick, we're not gonna let them. soak in it 'til they're soft. How hard is this? (laughs) This would be a fun one to make with your children or your grandchildren. They would have fun, fun making this. Okay, so we're gonna come back in with another layer of. our yummy whipped cream. So you see, if you want to make this using six sack of chocolate. chip cookies, you can. Like I said, I love making it. when I've got fresh cookies. Fresh homemade cookies, but I'm gonna have to get this up here where I can get to it. Mm. Okey-dokey. Okay, so we're gonna go over. with another layer of cookies, and you see I didn't. put much milk in there 'cause you really don't need much, unless you're making this for a big crowd. 'Cause see, we're not. leaving it long enough for those cookies to soak. up much of that milk. So can you believe how easy, fast, and easy this recipe is, y'all? And you don't have to use chocolate chips. You can use whatever cookie you like. I love macadamia nut cookies a lot. Peanut butter cookies I love a lot. Oatmeal cookies I love a lot. So, you know, whatever. your favorite cookie is. So that was our last layer, and I think we got three. layers out of there. So like I said, if you. were making a big pile, you would want to use more whipping cream. Like I said, I started with two cups, 'cause once you whip it, and I. added 1/2 cup of sugar to it, (sink splashing) so let's see, I may just kinda let. those cookies peek out just a little bit, you know? So you can know what's. going on. (chuckles) It could stand a little bit. more green, couldn't it? Should I squirt more green on it or do you y'all think it's okay? - [Eddie] It looks green.. - I think it's green. - Okay. And I put 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, I think, in that whipping cream. So this is the last step, y'all. You can use walnuts, pecans, almonds, whatever cookie you decide to use. - [Woman] Our recipe says 1/2 cup, but Paula never uses 1/2 cup. - You know, when I'm doing nuts, I don't measure my nuts, y'all. - [Woman] I know, that's. why I give you a big bag. - Yes, 'cause I always like extra. And y'all know what? I have gotten where I. made that carrot cake along with Sally's help for. Kari, my niece's 40th birthday, and I use walnuts instead of pecans, and think I'm in love with walnuts. I think I like them about as. much as I do a pecan. (laughs) I never thought I'd say that. So love and best dishes, y'all. There you go. We got to let it sit for a little while so what little milk those. cookies got on them, we got to let it kinda. soften it up a little bit.;['postres']
XcBGMWcQSwE.json;"- We're chugging right along, y'all, with our 12 days of Christmas cookies. It seems like we've spent 24 days making these cookies, Eddie. (Eddie chuckles) Now how many does this make? - [Eddie] Right now we're. only on recipe number five. - No! No, no. - [Eddie] We did three already. - We had five. We did three, and then we did two. And then we did, I think. this will be number eight. I think. If I'm correct. So we getting' close.. - [Eddie] Did we really? We did five already?. - Uh huh. - [Eddie] With Teresa? Oh. - Yeah, I remember when Theresa left. 'cause we said, ""Gosh, we got five of some wonderful cookie recipes that have been sent in by. our friends out there."" And this next cookie sounds wonderful. It's Godiva chocolate, sea. salt, and hazelnut cookies. That's a mouthful. And it sounds good. Well, we could not find the Godiva chocolate. anywhere in this town. But, Casey found Ghirardelli. And then Lindt chocolate. So I don't think it'll make. all that much difference. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. I don't know. But this recipe was sent. in by Pamela Hudson. And she sent me a picture. I love it. (chuckles) She sent me a picture of one of their cookie swaps. And she said they have the best time. Let me see. Look. (chuckles) One of them is wearing a beard. Beard on a stick. One's wearing a bow tie. One of them is chewing on some butter. (Paula chuckles) And these two are just. having fun watching them. (amused giggle) All right. So let's see. ""Every year my parents would. host numerous holidays. Open houses starting from. Thanksgiving to Christmas and it made the holidays. pure magic for me. We would start preparations. around Halloween with making dough and freezing. So baking of the magical. cookies would be easier. My mother would also host an annual cookie exchange. party for friends. A tradition I've carried on when I can. Here are a few favorites of mom and mine. Can't wait to watch. when you do the airing."" So, thank you, Pamela. But, you know she said, ""These are a few of my mama's favorites."" But I only got one recipe, Pamela. So, I don't know, 'cause. to me a few is three. So, I would hate if you sent. them, and I had misplaced them. So, that's the only. recipe I can find, Pamela, from you and your mother. But it sounds like a heavenly one. So, let's go ahead and get started. By melting a stick of butter. And Pamela said, ""Don't let it spit."" (soft chuckle) ""Don't let your butter spit."" I guess, by that she means,. don't let your butter spit. (giggles softy). (paper crinkles gently) So I won't let it spit. And when that melts, we are. gonna add our dark brown sugar. Our white sugar. It calls for castor sugar, which is a a finer sugar. than, you know, what we use. But we're just using. regular sugar, Pamela. So, hope that doesn't mess anything up. And then, we're gonna fold in our flour and we're gonna let that cool. And then, we're gonna add. our chocolate and our eggs. Our baking powder, our. soda, and hazelnuts. And does this not call. for any kind of extracts? It doesn't, does it? Okay, Pamela, you can see. our butter's not spitting but it's melted through and through. So I'm gonna add our dark brown sugar, our white sugar, castor sugar, if you have it. (spoons clang loudly) And we're gonna stir that together. And we did take that off the heat. I cut off the flame. (gritty scrapes) That looks good already.. (chuckles lightheartedly) Just the brown sugar.. - [Eddie] Brown sugar? Sure. - Uh-huh, and the dark brown sugar? Yes, looks wonderful. All right. So, now I'm gonna add our flour. And then we're gonna set it to the side and let it. cool for about 10 minutes. And then we'll add our. egg and our chocolate. While this is cooling,. I'm gonna do a rough chop on our chocolate. (soft metallic scrapes) (gentle taps) I truly cannot tell y'all how. much pleasure it brings me to hear from y'all and. receive your recipes. And I just thank you for. sharing with all of us. And helping you keep your memories alive. Now, a rough chop.. (tender crackle) You know, people's rough. chop could be interpreted many different ways. (chocolate clatters) (robust snaps) Snap, snap! (snaps continue) Okay. (chocolate clatters softly) Oops! Is it a flyaway, Eddie? - [Eddie] Uh-huh. (soft metallic clang) (sharp snaps). (jewelry jingles mildly) (glass clinks sharply) - [Eddie] This could be a. chocolatey cookie, here. - [Paula] Huh?. - [Eddie] Look at all that chocolate. - [Paula] These are gonna. be some chocolate cookies. (metallic clang) (wooden scratches). Okay. All right. Our next step is to toast off our hazelnuts. And I put just a little. pat of butter in there. And it won't take long to toast your nuts. In fact, any kind of nuts. that you're roasting, they can burn very quickly. So you'll wanna stand there and be stirring them the. whole time, constantly. Lest you burn your nuts. So, we don't want that to happen. (soft metallic clatter) So, I'm gonna kind of,. turn that heat down some. And like I said, I'm gonna. kind of, stand right here with them and watch them. And then I'm gonna come over here and see if this is cool enough. And I think that it is. (loud scratching sound) I think that it's cool enough. Look that, y'all. Looks pretty good, doesn't it? (Paula giggles gently) All right. So, we're gonna add one egg. Our soda. (glass bowls clink loudly) Our baking powder. Now I'm just gonna go ahead and mix that all together. So we won't have any trouble. (loud clinks and grinds) (glass rasps wetly). mixing it into our dough. Okay. So here we go. (glass bowl clatters) And like I said, that's. a real thick batter. (machine whirring in the background) (batter crunches softly) I can't wait to taste these! (spoon taps loudly). All right. By roasting and toasting a nut, it helps bring out the flavor. It makes so much difference. It just makes that nut come alive. (pan clangs softly) Okay, I think that's enough. So I'm gonna go ahead and. add this to our dough. And Casey's preheating our oven, and we're gonna get these in the oven. And we're gonna be eating a. fancy cookie 'fore too long. Okay, our cookies are. going in the oven at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes. Which is kind of the average. bake time for cookies. These look incredible! Who's hiding around that corner? Oh hi, darling! (laughs jovially) My cousin and his wife just have come up. And I'm gonna put Don to work. Don's a great cook. But anyway, Pamela, I. cooked these for 10 minutes. And I left the other tray in the oven for about two more minutes. But I know your instructions said you know, done, but a soft center. And these smell divine. So I'm gonna leave them. on the tray to cool for five minutes. And then I'm gonna try one. Pamela Hudson. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us. They look divine. They look like a wonderful, uppity? I don't wanna say uppity. But it looks like- - [Eddie] A little gourmet cookie. - Yeah, a little gourmet cookie. Like, maybe the ingredients. would kind of costly. (Paula and Casey chuckle) - [Eddie] Well, Godiva chocolate. - Yeah, Godiva. And Casey couldn't find it. Thank you so much. And I'm just so nosy. to know what you meant by ""A few recipes."" 'Cause I only got one. - [Eddie] Theresa might. be holding out on us. - Am I being greedy now? Where's the other ones?. (giggles softly) (chews delicately) If you like chocolate, y'all have to open up the link to this and get the exact measurements because it's a wonderful chocolate cookie. And thank you so much for sharing. And Pamela said in her little note, ""Oh I hope you choose mine to make I can't hardly wait to. see if you pick mine."" (chuckles) We picked yours. Mmm. Mmm.";['postres']
Xde7JAI4yEM.json;"- Have y'all ever made a promise to one of your grandchildren and you find yourself just all. the time forgetting about it? (Paula laughing). - Uh. - Have you ever done that, have you ever forgotten to make a promise that you made to your grandchildren? - I don't have grandchildren. - Oh you don't? (Paula laughing) Y'all, this is John Reed. John, now I have to figure. out which number you are in the birth chain. Okay-- - Mom-- - Jack, Maddie, Sully? - Yes. - Was Sully next? Or Henry? No, Henry was next. And then Sully, and then you. - Bennett. - Bennett-- - [Man] He should be number five. - (laughs) I think he's. number five, y'all. For a while I thought I was. never gonna have grandchildren and all of a sudden they. started spitting 'em out, like, ""(laughs) When. are y'all gonna stop?"" So we're up to number 11 now. So you're right in the middle of the 11 grandchildren. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. And this is Michelle's youngest son. And he was going through my recipe drawer where I just keep random recipes, and he said, ""What is this, Guinea?"" and I said, ""Oh, John, ""it's a soda that somebody. from Texas sent to me, ""and they sent a recipe along with it,"" and this has been, really,. a good, long while ago. And I said, ""I don't. know where the recipe is, ""it would take me an hour to. dig it outta that drawer,"" so I just went on my computer. and I found us a recipe for the Big Red Texas cake. So, we're gonna take this Big Red, and we're gonna make that cake, as I promised you one. day that we would, right? - Mm-hmm. - And I'm keeping my promise (laughs). Okay, so this is, he just got through whipping. up some heavy cream. We beat up like a cup with. a fourth of a cup of sugar, 'cause we like our fresh cream sweet. So we gonna sit that to the side. Now, John, what I need for you to do, and I'll do a few just to show you, we are gonna just poke holes in it. - That's weird, but okay. - Okay, you got it (laughs)? You'll be good at poking holes, and you don't have to rush. You know, you can take your time. They also call this cake. a poke cake in Texas. And I've got some poke cake recipes, but, okay, well what are we. gonna do about the rest? We've got to get all the way around it, until we meet in the middle. Do you wanna take over doing this? You see what I'm sayin'? We gonna do the whole cake, We gonna poke the whole cake, because we got some good. stuff to go in there. - Did it. - You did it? You durn sure did it. You durn sure did it, boy. All right, there's you a crumb-- - Yeah! - And me a crumb. (John laughing). Your crumb fell. (Paula laughing) - That's yummy. - That is so yummy. All right, so, I had to, because I didn't have time to take everything outta that drawer of junk.. - This is just making me hungry. - It's making you hungry? (John laughing). Well we're gonna eat very soon. All right, so now it tells us to boil one cup of water for the strawberry Jell-O-- - Okay. - Allow to dissolve, and. then take it off the heat, then add one can of Big Red soda with the Jell-O. All right, so we gonna. bring this to a boil. (oven knob clicking) And we're gonna open our Jell-O. And we're gonna pour that in, and we're gonna stir. that until it dissolves. (package rattling). But I just want, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait just one second, it's not boiling yet.. - Is this powder? - It's powder. Yeah, so it'll go everywhere, so how about if I get it started for ya? But the water's got to boil--. (package ripping) (laughs) You scare me. Okay, the water's got to boil. All right, let's see. which spoon we wanna-- - I made Jell-O with my mom before. - What does that say? - Michelle. - No, it says Michael! - Michael? - That's your Poppa's spoon (laughs). Somebody--. - Who's Bobby? - Your Uncle Bobby! - Oh! (Paula laughing) - And what does that one say? - Paula. - That's me. - Wait this is, I think, oh. - Yep, that's Poppa's. - But Bobby's my uncle. - Uh-huh. - Why is your kid on that-- - Uncle Jamie is missing. I was on a show one time and for a gift they. gave me a set of spoons, a set of four. (Paula laughing) - So do I pour it whenever it's done? - It's not boiling yet. We got to make sure that. it's at a full boil, because we want this to dissolve nicely. And if it's not boiling, it might not be able to. dissolve that Jell-O-- - Mm-hmm. - Like it should. - It's steaming. - If we touched it, it'd burn us, but, okay, now you see. it starting to boil? - It'd burn our skin off? - Starting to boil, oo, it'd pull our skin. straight off of us-- - I know. - And I would cry. - 'Course! Even my dad would cry! - (laughs) Even your dad would cry? - (laughs) Yes! - I bet he would! Okay, I'm gonna cut that off. So you just pour your Jell-O into there. - Wow, it looks cool. - Doesn't that look cool? - Yes. - I bet it looks like that. Big Red soda's gonna look when we open it.. - What if the camera just got dropped in? - Huh? - What if the camera. accidentally just got dropped in? - Our phone? - Yes. - Oh, we'd cry. (people laughing) We'd cry about that, too. Okay, so stir on that a little bit, and I'm gonna get us a ladle. - Wait, this feels so hot on my hand, but it's not gonna be--. - Just don't, just be careful, I don't want. you to sling it on yourself. (spoon clanking) All right, do you want to. open the can of Big Red? - Yes.. - I didn't turn that off! Okay, well there you go. I'm gonna, don't touch that, now, because it's hot, okay? - Of course it's hot. - Of course it's hot (laughs)! (soda can spewing) (John exclaiming). Ah! - Oh. - [Paula] Yay! That's all right, that's all right. - Do I pour it in? - [Paula] Pour it in! (drink sloshing) - It looks even cooler. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] That kinda looks. like magic, doesn't it? - (laughs) It does.. (Paula laughing) - [Paula] You wanna save. yourself a little sip and see if you think you gonna like it? - Mm! - [Paula] Is it good? - Mm-hmm. - All right, well, look, look what you left for me to step in. (Paula laughing). (John laughing) All right stand right there and I'm gonna get you a paper towel, okay? - All right. (can clanging) - And if you would get. that up for Guinea, please. (John humming) Oh, you learned the lazy man's way! (John laughing). (Paula laughing) - [John] That's how my mom does it. - That's how I do it too (laughs), John! (John patting) All right so, John, thank you, baby. So, it says now, ""Boil one cup of water for. the strawberry Jell-O,"" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. ""Add one can of Big Red coke. ""Pour this mixture into the. cake evenly with a ladle."" okay? - Mm-hmm. - And see, that's why we. poked the holes in it, so that all this stuff can get all in there. - Oo! - So you just wanna take your ladle-- - That looks cool! - Doesn't it look cool?. - How cool will it get? - It's gonna get so much. more cooler (laughs). (John laughing) - Wow.. - Okay, there you go. (ladle scrapping) Here you go, and try to evenly do it, you know, not just in one spot. (ladle clanking) - Oh my gosh. - Okay, now go around the edges. (ladle clanking) And these edges over here, too. - It dripped. - Uh-huh, a little drip, a little drip. (laughs) Oh gosh, this. is gonna be so good! - Yeah! - It's gonna be wet. It's gonna be so moist. Yes! All right, you know what, I think I might need to. stir this a little bit more. (ladle clanking) Let me stir it just a. little bit more, John. You know Guinea's eyes are gettin' so bad!. (John sniffing) - I actually smelled my way into the cake until I found the cake. (Paula laughing) - All right now, pour. some on this edge, baby. And down there.. (ladle clanking) Yeah. (whispers) And all down there. See where it's still kind of brown? (ladle clanking) (Paula laughing) - Is that all of the holes? - That's all the holes! (ladle clanking). - So we just dump the rest? - All right, yeah, do. more down on that end, I think this end has gotten more than-- - (hums) All right, is that it? - Okay, can I help you just one second, 'cause you're gettin' low.. (ladle scraping) (pot clanking) Okay, here you go. (liquid splashing) That's the last of it. I'm gonna come over here and just do right along that edge, okay? - Mm-kay. - Where maybe we didn't get some. (pot and ladle clanking) - Hmm, now I don't know if it's-- - All right, we still got another step. - It looks yummy. (Paula laughing) - Okay, so we are ready to. put the icing on the cake. - Mm-kay. - Okay? Now if you'll hold that over that bowl-- - Is that Jell-O? - It's a Jell-O pudding, it's a instant Jell-O pudding.. (paper ripping) - I might like this (laughs). - Well, you got to go down, see where that line is right there? - Yeah.. - You have to tear below that. (package ripping) (John exclaiming) There you go (laughs), did you get some up your nose? - Mm-hmm. - All right, now we're gonna add--. - Do you use this? - No baby, we're gonna use this. - Okay. - All right, we're gonna. add two cups of cold milk. (milk sloshing) - It looks yellow. - Uh-huh, it does. - And it smells good. - Doesn't it smell good? All right, now you take your mixer. - Mm, and do it-- (mixer whirring). - And we're gonna just mix that up real good. And it doesn't take instant. pudding long to set up, John, it sets up real quick. (mixer whirring) Alright, are you tall enough that your arm will kinda stand up in it (laughs)? There you go, that's good. - Hey I just got it on my face.. - I know it, huh? - Just got on my face. - It got on your face (laughs)? Is it still gettin' on your face? I feel it! It's gettin' on my hand, let me cut it down a little bit. (mixer clacking) - I think it's still on my face. - (laughs) Oh, that's all right, 'cause that's where it's going. Okay.. (John exclaiming) Let's see if that's enough, your arm's give out, isn't it? - Stuff's going everywhere. - That should be good enough, I know, I could feel it when. I had my hand over your face. (laughs) I could feel it. hittin' my hands (laughs). (beaters clanging). All right, so what we gonna do next, as soon as this, would you like to go sit. that in the sink, baby? - Yes. - Right over there, and we'll walk right over--. - Wow, it is - freezing cold.. - Okay. It's freezing cold? - Freezing! - So it'll just take a. couple of minutes for this to (spoon clanking). set up. (John banging) And then-- Oh, thank you, John, you-- (water splashing). That's great, you're rinsing the milk out of it. Good boy! So, John-- - Yes?. - We are gonna take our whipped cream, remember you making. the fresh whipped cream with the sugar in it? - Yes. - When this sets up just a minute, we are gonna fold in our. whip cream into our pudding, and then we're gonna pour. that all on top of that cake. And you know what the hardest. part of this is gonna be? - What? Eating it? 'Cause I love eating it.. - No, that's gonna be easy. (John laughing) The hard part is gonna. be waiting the six hours that it (laughs) has to sit! - Mm-hmm. - Can you do that? - Yes! - (laughs) Well we don't, we might can fudge on that. You know, and make it-- - Well it looks good! - It does look delicious, and I think it'll be worth the wait. What are you doing? (Paula laughing). - Well, I just kinda like doing that. - Tell everybody what grade you're in. - First grade. - First grade. And you go to-- - I'm seven. - You're seven. And where do you go to school? Tell everybody where you go to school. - Saint Andrew's. - Saint Andrew's, it's a. great school, isn't it? - Mm-hmm. - Yes ma'am. - Yes ma'am. - (laughs) You're a sweet boy! All right, see? You see it's getting thick, John? - Yes. Looks like eggs. - It does look like eggs, doesn't it? - Mm-hmm. - Well why don't you dab a. piece of that on your finger and see if it tastes like eggs. - Tastes good. - Doesn't taste like eggs, does it? - Tastes nothing like eggs. (John smacking). - (laughs) But it's good. All right, you think that's stiff enough or you think we ought to wait? - I think that's stiff enough. - Oh, you do? Well, I think--. - 'Cause it's good enough. - I think we ought to wait. just a couple of more minutes. - Okay, then that's gonna be-- - Okay.. - A couple minutes into two hours.. - It'll fly by, it'll go by like that (snaps). Two minutes. - All right, two seconds. - (laughs) Two minutes. - 'Kay? - The hardest part is. going to be doing nothing. - (laughs) Oh, you know what? I think you'll find something to do. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. What do you think you'll do while we're waiting?. - I don't know. - You have a pretty good idea, right? - How do I have a good idea when I didn't even have an idea yet? (Paula laughing). (woman laughing) - Because I feel like. you'll think of a good idea. - Huh, still makes no sense. - [Paula] It makes no sense? - Yes. - A lot of things in life. don't make any sense, sonny boy (laughs). (bowl clanging) All right, here we go. Now, John, look at me, we are gonna fold these. two things together, and I don't mean just get in there and do 'em like that, I mean fold. So you bring your rubber. spatula down and over, down and over, and down and over, just like that, and that's called folding. - That's hard for me to. fold when I normally fold-- - It's hard for you to fold? - I fold clothes, not like that. - Oh (laughs)! (people laughing) Well, thank goodness we're. not having to fold clothes right this minute. - Yeah. My legs hurt from standing a lot. - Your legs, wait, wait, wait, wait! Say that again! - My legs hurt from the standing. - Are you already tired of workin'? - Uh-uh. (Paula laughing). (woman laughing) My legs are tired of working. - You know what? - 'Cause my legs walk every day. - When your Guinea started in the restaurant business, I thought my legs were gonna quit on me, 'cause I usually, an average. workday was 16 hours. And oo, my golly! That will tear your legs up! But as you get older, your. legs will get stronger. - I thought when you get. older, your legs get tireder. - Well (laughs), (people laughing) well, when you get a certain point, yes. Yes. - So you're basically saying it's kind of, like a middle? - Yeah, yeah. Like when you're 30, oo, you're so strong! And then 40 comes along and. you're still very strong. - Hey, that rhymed.. - And then 50 comes along and then you think, ""Hmm."" And then 60 comes along and you think, ""Ouch, I'm gonna have to. stay in the bed today."" (people laughing) And then 70 comes along, and (laughs) you think you might need to just wear a hospital. gown all the time (laughs). - When you're at 80 you have gray hair. - Yes, when you're 80 you have gray hair. And look at Great-Great. - Hmm? - Great-Great is fixing to be, next Thursday, she'll be 91 years old. - Whoa! - And, what you think. that might feel like? - I don't, tiring? - Tiring? (people laughing) Well Great-Great is very, very strong, but she is having some. problems with her back and her legs, now. Because things like that. just happen with age. Okay, John, run your. finger over that, son, and see what you think. - Mm! (Paula laughing) (smacks) Ah! (Paula laughing) Even though I don't like, what is it called? (person exclaiming) - I don't know! (woman explaining) Pudding? - [Woman] Cake! - [John] What's it called? - Cake? - [Woman] Cake. (person laughing). - Even though I don't like cake, this cake is actually pretty good. - When did you quit liking cake?! Because every time you come to my house-- - That's because you bake really good. - Oh (laughs)! - [Henry] You stopped. liking it three years ago. - And you're famous,. how good your stuff is. - I'm famous 'cause it's so good? - Yes!. (Paula laughing) - Well, you're gonna love this cake, you and Henry are gonna eat this up! Look at that. All right, you wanna get this last (spatula banging). part out? - Sure. - Of the bowl? Okay, there you go. - It looks like that's enough. - Okay, there you go, you wanna put this last bit on? - Mm-hmm! - Okay. And just spread it into the cake. - That was easy. - (whispers) Yes! - What is this part for? - What part, baby? - This part. - This part? It's to do like this with, just make sure your icing. is good and spread out. And then I'm gonna go like that and get all of the goody off of it, and make sure it gets on our cake. Now you know what? - What?. - I've gotta, would you like that? - Mm-hmm. (Paula laughing). Mm! - Here, I think I might can. get you a little bit more. You know what, John? - What? - I am so glad that you reminded me-- - Mm! - That I had promised to. make this cake (laughs)-- - Mm.. - With you. 'Cause I've had so much fun. (hands clapping) Will you come back to. see me and cook again? - [John] Mm-hmm! - [Paula] Well, I love ya! - [John] I love you, too. - And I thank you. So, we're gonna put your cake, your Big Texas Red--. - Yummy Coke cake. - Huh? - Yummy cake. - Yes (laughs). Your Big Red Texas cake. - Hey, big--. - I love the people of Texas, I love Texas folks.. - Big Texas yummy. - Tell us the verdict! - Well, this is the cake. - Mm-hmm! - When only cheating. - [Paula] (laughs) Oh, you talking about the hours that it was supposed to sit? - [John] Yes. - Well, I wanna know what it tastes like. How do you like it? - It's so good! - Well would you share. it with your brother? - Mm-hmm! - [Paula] Yay, Henry (laughs). Okay. John's a sharer!. - He shared with me. (water splashing) - Your brother's a sharer, isn't that good? - And I'm a sharer, I shared my (indistinct) with him. - Yes you are a sharer. - I want, is there any. strawberries that I can put on it? - Yeah! Right here, I'll take one of these off. How about that? - Sounds a lot better with strawberries. - This is a pretty cake, y'all. - It tastes like strawberries. - It does, doesn't it?. - Mm-hmm! - Maybe the strawberry--. - Look, see how pretty it is? - Maybe the strawberry juice. (laughs) soaked into it. - I know it, and look at. that, that's just pure wet. My kinda cake (laughs)!. - I'm looking for water. - All right, there you go, big Hen. - That's perfect.. - Can I get some (indistinct)? - Wait, let me get your strawberry!. - Mom! - I can't get it out! - [John] Mom? - That's the one John pressed down in it, (laughs) he didn't wanna come out. There you go! My favorite job (laughs).";['postres']
xmW7MiksNCA.json;[Music] I've got one more thing to put together real quickly and that's Michaels white chocolate cherry chunkies we're gonna start by creaming one stick of butter with one cup of packed brown sugar and that's a light brown sugar and a cup of granulated sugar now we're just gonna let this stand we're going to cream that and that won't take long and we're gonna have cookies in the oven before you can say Jack Sprat I'm gonna add two eggs one at the time alright now I'm gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla to our batter and while that's beating we've got an all-purpose flour and I've got a half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then our batter will be ready for us to add it to that alright so we're gonna stick a couple of tablespoons of milk and and now we're gonna add our flour like I said this is gonna be a real stiff batter so I'm gonna do it just a little bit at the time I don't want to shock that batter by dumping the whole bowl of flour into it you can hear the mixer starting to labor now because we've gotten all of our flour in there and it is stiff okay I'm gonna add white chocolate and macadamia nuts and candied cherries so you could really mix this up and come up with two or three different kinds of cookies for this one batter all right you can see how stiff it is I'm gonna mix it around a little bit with the spatula and now I'm going in for the kill I'm gonna do it with my fingers and this is a job the children will love to help you with I'm gonna put these on my greased cookie sheet and I'm gonna do rounded tablespoons of batter and I mean I'm really gonna round them up because no Chansey cookies at our house we want nice fat cookies the most important thing is that you want all your cookies the same size because you want them to cook uniformly and all take the same amount of time all right now we're gonna put these in our preheated 375 degree oven and I can't hardly wait to taste one we're gonna let them bake for about 12 minutes and in the meantime I'm gonna be training up some more trays so I can get them in and out of the oven quickly all right in with that pan and out with the other pan now that's been 12 minutes I want to get these off that cookie sheet because like I said if you don't get them off pretty quickly they can sometimes stick on you now I want to give you one more hint about cookie baking you never want to put your cookie dough on a hot cookie sheet so you'll want to or three sheets so you can always start off with a cold sheet in the oven I think they're cool enough for me to have a little bite mmm wonderful [Music];['postres']
XSPYYxEctFc.json;so yah we made the peach cobbler earlier now I think I can't do this with gloves yo I just washed my hands but I've got to have my real fingers to do this one sorry I think this is the fourth show I've done for YouTube the very first one I did cracker salad you know I told John that I'm trying to come up with little things that hopefully you have in your pantry at home so we did the peach cobbler earlier well now I'm gonna share with you my fried pies and it has this airfryer of mine has just worked beautifully for my fried pies now this is what my grandmother Paul used I don't even know in her kitchen years if there was even so much if there was such thing as puff pastry back then I don't remember but I remember this I remember grandma taking her canned biscuits taking the cover off or wrapping it and saying I was so damn glad when they came out with these canned biscuits she loved the convenience of canned biscuits that's what she used to make a blackberry cobbler that's what she used to make her fried pies but I on the other hand prefer puff pastry that's my favorite I'll use a canned biscuit if I don't have any choice but I've taken my sheet of and look I cook 20 and had it ready for you I put a little dollop of butter on it because remember there was no butter yes no butter in it or on it oh so I am dampening the edges of my puff pastry you got to wet it a little bit so that you can seal it so I'm gonna put a scoop of my blueberry pudding I mean my blueberry cop my pie filling y'all and this comes in strawberry it comes in apple cherry cherry it just comes in so many flavors is there a dishrag right there that I can thank you Eddie Oh comes in a lot of flavors and this is the most convenient way to make fried pies I've got my mushrooms thank you I've got my mushroom I'm not my mushrooms my peaches and my pear trees out there and so I've got I've got fresh pears and fresh peaches in my freezer but we would have to take those out sweeten them cook them down and then we would have to thicken them with cornstarch because this pie filling has to be thick if it was spinning it would run all out we would have no juice all right so I've got those sides nice and damp so we're just gonna fold it over now you get in puff pastry you get two sheets why do my puff pastry box oh don't worry about it you get two sheets and I take my my itty-bitty baby rolling pin and roll that sheet of puff pastry out just a little bit so it's not quite so thick and I get four fried pies out of one sheet of puff pastry so in order to make sure this is feels good and my pie filling doesn't come out I'm putting my times of my fork in flour and I'm just coming around like that making sure it's good and sealed all right now I kind of like a shiny finish so I'm going to wait you know what I'm gonna go ahead and make another pie before I do that I think I'll make three pies because that's what I've got laid out okay so these are so simple y'all it's almost silly they're so simple and people will just think that you've been to a lot of trouble my favorite fried pie of all fried pies believe it or not y'all is pear and then apple is my favorite after that one and peach is probably my least favorite fried pie and I can't tell you why cuz I love peaches I love peach cobbler but when it comes to fried pies I I love those pears now this puff pastry when you thaw it out it comes tri folded and when you unfold it well it takes a few minutes but to thaw out before you can unfold it but as soon as it starts falling you can gently unfold it and then it it thaws out really really quick when you spread it out and I sprinkled a little powder on my piece of parchment paper so I could roll that crust out a little thinner okay so here we go just that quickly I've made three front well actually I made four because I had one for y'all to see and I think I cooked him about 10 minutes in the air fryer that grandmama and myself have always fried these on top of the stove and a nice big skillet with maybe half an inch or each of grease all whatever you use to cook the frying and that makes them really tasty but I have realized the value of that airfryer y'all I can get basically the same effect without any grease ever touching it so that really helps me on my watching my intake of fat now I've just used just the egg yolk for this and you see how pretty and yellow that is so it made it made that pie like a pretty golden brown I'm gonna I've got room for probably one more but I could probably do four but I'm just gonna do three and I did after the top started getting brown y'all I did flip them over for a few minutes because I didn't want a doughy bottom on my pie I wanted to make sure it was all nice and brown all the way around I don't know who came up with that puff pastry y'all but I could kiss them square on the lips because I've never had a desire to try to make my own and I admire people very much that are into making all those delicate breads but I've always just been a housewife trying to beat the clock you know what I mean so I'm gonna spray this I'm just gonna kiss it with a touch of I think this is canola no this is bacon but you can use any kind you like you can use the temperature you can find them in all different selections all right now I've got this on 350 and I'm putting for 10 minutes I don't like to I don't like to use my airfryer and put it 25 or 30 minutes because I would no matter what I'm cooking I like to at least check it at the end of ten minutes so and it's even less if I'm just eating up something so then we go just that simple what am I forgetting gang what am I forgetting reconnecting goodnight yeah [Music] that's a pretty good job and I know probably a lot of y'all keep these biscuits in your refrigerator the first one thing and then another so it really makes it convenient if you don't have an air fryer get your big frying pan load it with whatever kind of all you choose to use and fry them on top of the stove we're lazy one thing that but this is good and this is saving me some fats that I don't need whether one Eddie aunty Oh that is exactly the way I deserve it piggy asked if I would surf that with some ice cream yes yes all you think is just fresh sweetened whipped cream and those frozen whipped topping personally I don't use those I like the real deal but whatever your tongue likes that's the most important thing about all cooking that's what it depends on your tongue and I love y'all and I will be doing these some more please let me hear from you if you have any special requests and just remember we're all in this together and we are going to get through it and we'll come back stronger smarter than ever love and best

yE6Tqq3bdhk.json;- I truly just love it when. I hear from y'all out there because I don't near about think I have all the. answers, 'cause I don't. So, I just love hearing something that I've never heard of before. And that's the case with this text that I got from Richie Gibbons. And just a general inquiry, I recently found a recipe. I'm going to share with you. It's a recipe for a. stabilized whipped cream. So have you ever made a. cake that called for just sweetened whipped cream for the frosting? Well, if you have, you know that you have to keep the cake. in the refrigerator, right? Because of the fresh cream and because it just has sugar. in it and that's it. So by adding these other ingredients, you're gonna stabilize that whipped cream and you can leave that cake on a counter, just like you would like my carrot cake that's on the counter right now. So stabilized whipped cream. I have found that this version. tends not to fall as easy and would be great for those. recipes that may not be eaten in one sitting, which is great. I love that Richie. So it's four ounces of cream. cheese that's been softened, for at least an hour at room temperature, a third of a cup of powdered sugar, one and a half teaspoons. of pure vanilla extract, and one cup of heavy cream. So Richie tells us to whip the whipped cream. And let's see what they say. to beat the cream cheese with the powdered sugar and vanilla. All right. So. That's one teaspoon and a half a teaspoon and our confectionary sugar. So now we're just gonna. beat that until it's smooth and creamy-like. I am so glad to know this trick. I can't wait to taste it. You know, one of my. favorite frostings/icings is cream cheese icing. So this is just a great, great tip Richie. And I so appreciate you sharing. it with me so that I could, in turn, share it with. all my friends out there. So Richie says beat the cream cheese with the powdered sugar and vanilla until soft and creamy and then. transfer to a small bowl. In the mixing bowl, and you. don't even have to clean it up, beat the heavy whipping cream. just until soft peaks form. You'll want them to. collapse, not stand up. 'Cause I'm used to beating. whipping cream until it stands on its own. So I'll have to watch myself there. Add the cream cheese by. distributing it in thirds around the mixing bowl. And then beat until. stiff peaks are formed. Store in the refrigerator. till you're ready to use it. Okay, so I'm gonna sling that off, and rather than transferring. that to another bowl, I'm just gonna get... I'm just gonna get another bowl out and I'm gonna beat my whipped cream until it collapses. When I, you know, you know what I'm trying to say. When I dob a bit up, I just want to make sure that it doesn't stand in stiff peaks, but kind of just folds back into itself. Okay. So here it goes. (mixer whirling) - When you're whipping cream, you have to start out kind of slow. 'Cause it's really just. the consistency of milk, but after it starts to. tightening up a little bit, then you can go for it. All right. Let's see if that collapses. I would say that. collapses, wouldn't y'all? Wouldn't you think that's. about ready, Eddie? - [Eddie] Yeah. - All right. So Richie said to distribute it into thirds. around the mixing bowl. I may have to do it in fourths, but I don't think that's an issue. Okay. And now Richie said just beat it until stiff peaks form. I think it's there. What do you think, Eddie? - [Eddie] That looks great. - That looks like stiff. peaks to me, doesn't it? Do you? - [Eddie] Like buttercream icing. -Yes. So let's give it the taste test. Richie, that is so good. And you best believe when I. make my next little ice box coconut cake that you have. to keep in the refrigerator 'cause it's got that frozen. topping or just plain old, fresh whipped cream on it. I'm gonna be using this. recipe for that icing and in place of the vanilla flavoring, I'll be using a coconut flavoring, for the coconut cake. Thank you so much. So that is definitely. stabilized whipped cream. Thank you, Richie. I appreciate it. Love you for it. Love and best dishes to all of y'all.;['postres']
Ye8adSVOgh4.json;- I am just consumed with. thoughts of Memorial Day, because you know, it's. like we can see some light at the end of the tunnel. We just hope it ain't that damn train, you know what I mean? But I just feel like. the country is starting to come back, as far as health-wise and, I'm just hoping and praying that everybody's gonna be able to. enjoy Memorial Day this year. So, I'm just thinking. about quick and easy things that you can make for your family to enjoy that doesn't break the bank and it certainly doesn't break the brain. This one's so, so easy. So, I've got a cup and. a half of heavy cream, and I'm adding two. tablespoons of sugar to it. And I'm just gonna whip this until it's pretty firm peaks, of fluffy whipping cream. Did I ever tell y'all. what we're making today? (Paula Deen laughs) I think I was just talking to. y'all about the ease of this. We're making a double. strawberry shortcake. All right, now I've got my. cream mixed really, really nice. But, it needs about another. 30 seconds to a minute. So, now I'm gonna add to my whipped cream, three tablespoons of strawberry preserves. All right. And like I said, I'm. gonna whip this together for about another 30 seconds. (hand mixer whirring) You'll wanna be careful when. you're whipping your cream. Because, if you over-whip it,. it'll turn back into butter. And for this recipe we don't want butter. Now, I've got a beautiful. homemade cake right here. This is mamma's homemade pound cake. (cake stand slams) (Paula Deen laughs) That's the heaviest top,. Eddie. I'm so afraid. This is a vintage top, and I'm so afraid I'm gonna drop it one day. I've had it a good. while though, haven't I? - [Eddie] Yeah. - Now, I've got this pound. cake, but you know what? I think I'm gonna go. with my first thought, which is a store-bought, bought this from the deli. at the grocery store. So, I think I'm gonna. save my homemade cake for, a different dessert. All right, so, let's. see, I need to cut these. I'm gonna kinda, just trim that end. And we wanna cut these. about an inch thick. All right. So, I have, I think it was. a pint of strawberries, and a couple of tablespoons of sugar. And we let these sit for a little while, and that just makes the best. The best. Alright, let me see. Sometimes I can't remember,. there's so many things rolling around in my head. So, we're gonna put. the strawberries first. Oh, that looks so good. Now, you could serve 'em open faced, or you could serve it like. I'm going to serve it. Because I call this a. double strawberry shortcake, and it wouldn't be a double if I didn't stack 'em on top of each other, would it? And I do love lots of. strawberry juice, y'all. Okie doke. And now, I'm gonna top it. You can see our cream, went a little bit towards the pink side. The pink side. It's been so long since I've made this. So, I would definitely suggest adding more strawberry preserves. to your whipping cream. 'Cause I'd like it to be,. you know, a nice pinky color. But that looks pretty good, doesn't it? - [Woman Off Screen] Ooh, she's being skimpy on the whipped cream. (Paula Deen laughs) - [Paula Deen] You think so? - [Woman Off Screen] Uh huh. - Well, get your tail over here and taste, before you start complaining, sister. (Paula Deen laughs) And, how easy was that? - I mean, that's the nice thing. And I get, and you know,. people think desserts are hard because they think. they take a lot of time, and they don't realize are so many. - And you used to think. that too, didn't you? - [Woman] Yes, I did. I did. That's why I like this recipe, because for those of us. that think it's hard, you just showed us it's not. Yum. Oh see, I'd have the whipped. cream all the way around. - Well, honey, I'll give. you some more whipped cream. But I really would add. more strawberry preserves. - [Woman] And if you. didn't want it that sweet, you could always put a little. food coloring in it too. And make it, pink it up if you want. - [Paula Deen] Yeah. But,. it's not really sweet. Mmm Mmm. - But you know, I can eat. whipped cream with a spoon. - Me too. (Woman laughs) And even that little store-bought. deli cake, from the deli, is perfectly delicious. for this dish, isn't it? - Mm Hmm, it's a good butter. - Mm Hmm. - My mom used to buy. those little shortcakes. - So did my mamma. - [Woman] Loved 'em. - Mm Hmm. - Little sponge cake. I. almost bought angel food cake. 'Cause I know, I think,. Eddie likes angel food, If I remember correctly. - Yes. - [Eddie] I do. - But, then I went for. the full-fledged fat one. (Paula Deen laughs) This is so tasty. The strawberries are. not so sweet that they. - [Woman] Now, did you tell them. The strawberries, they. tell you to cut them up, and let them come to room. temperature with your sugar in it. So, those were done in advance. - Didn't I, did I tell them that, Eddie? - [Eddie] Uh, well, I don't think you said come to room temperature. - Before you start your recipe, you wanna slice your strawberries up. and sprinkle 'em with sugar, so it can start making its syrup. See? There's no water in that, that is just the sugar pulling that beautiful juice out. of those strawberries. And you don't feel like. you have shortchanged your guests at all by. using a store-bought cake, because it's absolutely as. good if I have used that one. (Paula Deen laughs) So, if we are able to start back celebrating with larger family groups. You know, you wanna make it easy, you don't wanna make it hard. So, this is a great one. to do that with, y'all. So, love and best dishes! (Paula Deen laughs) Mmm Mmm. Good. Yummy to my tummy.;['postres']
YlL3VSwRpsw.json;- Hey, y'all, I'm Jamie Deen. I'm back in Mama's kitchen and. I'm here to share, you know, delicious, simple. recipes with y'all today. We're working out of The. Deen Brother's Cookbook. We've lost the cover. This is mom's copy. My brother and I wrote this cookbook after we did our first. television show together, and we're gonna do the. chocolate chip pie today. This is inspired from Royers Cafe, which was in Round Top, Texas. They did a delicious pie there and so what my brother and. I did, through our travels, we put all the recipes. inspired by our trip and our television show, and we put them in this book. About three pages behind the. chocolate chip pie recipe is the Texas Margarita, best margarita you've. ever had in your life. That comes from Austin as well. My man Skeeter, at the county line. Okay, chocolate chip pie. First thing we're gonna do y'all, we've got all of our. ingredients here together. Teresa got all of our. ingredients here together. I've got two greased, nine inch pie pans. I've got our flour because we'll give you. all the measurements and everything you're gonna need but the first thing we're. gonna start with is our flour and Teresa took the tops. off of these, but I know that this is baking soda (dog barking) and then this is some salt and this is a little bit of baking powder. Mama's dogs are barking. (dogs barking) I'm gonna sift this together. I'm hurrying, Lulu. - [Teresa] She wants me to say hello. (Teresa laughing) - Now I don't have my traditional sifter, so I'm just gonna mix all. of this stuff here together. So, I've kind of stirred,. sifted, our four dry ingredients: baking soda, baking. powder, salt and flour. Now, this is one part. Now, what I love about this pie is that it's a little bit. of work on the front end, but the filling is really easy. Y'all are gonna really enjoy this recipe. Now, I'm gonna cream up my butter. I got two sticks of butter that T-Bone has pulled out. for me and it's softened. I'm gonna get this in the bowl and then we're gonna cream. this with granulated sugar and powdered sugar. I'm gonna whip this up. (mixer churning) The butter's nice and soft. It really is worth the effort. just to soften up your butter a little bit, especially. if you start creaming it. Add a little bit of our sugar here. I'm not gonna dump. everything here at one time. I don't want it grainy or lumpy. I want it really smooth and creamy 'cause this is the bottom of our pie. So, basically we're baking here and baking was always. my brother's specialty because for me I'm more pinch and dash and baking, you have to be. exact in your measurements. I'm gonna go half with brown sugar and half with granulated sugar,. we're gonna cream this up. Hopefully our edit guy has. made this more interesting than I have and we will zoom through this. Okay, y'all I've got this cream together. So, now I'm going to add. my eggs one at a time. 'Cause you don't ever know, you might get a little. spot in one of your eggs, so you don't want to add your eggs. And what I like to do is, I crack them into a bowl, just to make sure that there's nothing in. my eggs before I add it. 'Cause sometimes you can get. a little spot in your egg and I don't know, I just like to, like to keep everything in its place. And we're gonna do one of these at a time and you see it's starting to take a little bit more of a. batter attitude with us. Go in our second egg. Also, cracking these over here gives me a chance to get shell out. I'm a notorious one hand cracker and my boys have known that sometimes there's a little crunchy in their eggs. Now our final egg. (mixer churning) To this, I'm gonna add our next to last ingredient, one tablespoon of vanilla. All right. Got our spatula here,. I'm gonna clean my edge. Now the very last process, last step here, I'm gonna fold in three cups of chocolate chips, woo. Royers is famous for. their pies that they do and one of the reasons is because they just absolutely load up. their crust with chocolate and when all this bakes in. together, great time of day. Let's see, what am I missing here? I have to sift in my flour now. Think of what I was about to do. I was about to make two. giant chocolate chip cookies. So, now into this, I. have to beat this flour. Now, I'm gonna do this. a little bit at a time because I really do not. want this to clump up. So a little, little, little, little, and y'all can watch this for a minute, and then we'll probly be back 'cause this is gonna. take me a few minutes. A little at a time. Y'all know, I don't know. I don't know everything. I leave that up to my Mama. So, I should have beat all the flour in, separately to my batter, and then fold in my chocolate. chips, per the instructions. My brother must have written that part. Although I put the chips in first, you can see we beat in our. flour a little bit at a time. We have a delicious batter here. Now, it's going into these two pie pans. So, here's kind of a trick. If you wanna get all your stuff together in one space. I got two pans, so I'm gonna go 50, 50. Start right down the center. I get my other half. And don't forget y'all, this is, both of these have been greased. You can use anything that you'd like and then we're gonna spread this down. We're baking our pie crust. - [Teresa] Yum. - Yum. So I'm gonna press it. down, get the edges up. This would be my wife's favorite. Now if you asked her, she. would say, okay that's done, hand it to me. She loves her cookie dough. - [Teresa] Me too. - Everybody loves cookie dough, except for me, I don't. - [Teresa] Your mom really. doesn't eat, I mean she- - Yeah, sweets really is not our thing. You can tell by looking at us, we're more of a savory family. My brother is the same. Okay, that looks pretty good. Oh, I've got one more. little block right here. Now, I've got to wash my hands but, before I break away. here, I'm going to tell y'all, this is going into oven. for about 30 minutes at 350. And when we're waiting on that, when y'all come back, I'll clean up, we're gonna get our topping ready, okay? See you in a minute. Mike over there, he don't eat nothing. He's an awesome guy. He don't eat nothing. He's worse than my five year old. I don't have a five year old. If I had a five year old,. Mike, you'd be worse than him. - [Mike] I know it. - He never eats what I cook. Look, woo, chocolate chip pies, Mike. - [Mike] I can do that. - [Jamie] You like that? - [Mike] I can do that. - Let's go. All right, I'm gonna make. the whip topping for y'all. I'm gonna put in 4 cups. of heavy whipping cream and the only reason why. I'm putting in 4 cups is because I couldn't fit 5 and the top of this daggum. thing is malfunctioning and I'm just gonna fight through it. So, 4 cups of cream and Teresa's put this bowl. into the freezer for me. If you make your own. homemade whipping cream that's a good trick, 'cause you want, this cream has to set up and. a cold bowl helps with that. So, you can buy any dessert you. want from the grocery store, not even a good one, a bad grocery store, put fresh homemade whipped topping on it and it will be delicious. We've got my whipping. cream, got our cold bowl. Now I've got half a cup. of confectioner's sugar I'm gonna add pretty slowly into here. If I can get it to go slow. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. There we go. Now, this takes a minute on high speed, so y'all bear with me. (mixer churning) Take it from me, once. you get these soft peaks, that's it, stop, because it will break down. It happened to me at the restaurant. You do not want to over beat your cream. So, once you get to these. soft peaks, that's it. Now, look how beautiful this is. Now, into this, I'm gonna fold... If can find me a rubber spatula, oh look, number one. I'm gonna fold this into here, but I'm gonna save some, 'cause this is gonna be. a pretty decoration, too. I'm gonna fold a little bit. of my whipped cream in here. Mm. My chocolate chips. Now, look at this. This is gonna go straight. onto this giant chocolate chip that we baked earlier. Wow. Mm mm mm mm. What do you think, T? - [Teresa] Oh my God. - [Jamie] Yeah - [Teresa] That's just a- - [Jamie] Teresa's just beside herself. She's already eaten the. beaters and the bowl (Teresa laughing) and now we're fixing to get the main dish. - [Teresa] I love sweets. - [Jamie] And our second pie. See, now I'm only going. to cut one of these, 'cause one of them is. fixing to grow wheels and it's coming to my house. My wife is gonna love this. Honey, look what I made. especially for you today. - [Teresa] Mm-Hmm. - Now, you can dress. this up any way you want. I mean, chocolate chips and whipped cream. You could put some, you could garnish with cherries. You could garnish with. a little bit of mint. You could put some blueberries on here. So many different ways you could go. But for our chocolate chip. pie, I'm just gonna save. Go right over the top with these. How nice that looks. Mama, which pan do you. want me to take home, the metal one or the glass one? - [Paula] The glass one. - [Jamie] Okay, so we're. gonna cut the metal one. - [Paula] Oh, mm mm mm. - [Jamie] Mom's in the corner tasting everything we've. been cooking this morning. It sounds like positive reviews. - [Paula] They are. - [Jamie] mm hmm. (Teresa gasps) - [Teresa] I almost had. to gasp on that one. - [Jamie] Did you hear Teresa, y'all? Did you hear Teresa? Look at that. Look at this chocolate chip. - [Teresa] Turn it down. just a little bit Jamie, you're tall. - [Jamie] Mm. Mm mm. Oh, I gotta take a picture of it. I was just about to eat it. Y'all tune in next week and you can see me, if I had any success in eating two whole. chocolate chip cookie pies. I'm drooling everywhere. I'm Jamie Deen. This is good pie. I'll see y'all around the kitchen.;['postres']
yNkAoFjxKnA.json;(upbeat music continues) So I want us to move along try next dish, because you're gonna love this one. All right, I'm gonna show y'all, how to make some of the neatest biscuits. (Paula laughing) (dog panting) It's you again? (Paula laughing) You knew I just took that off the oven. (Paula laughing) Now this is not gonna make but 10 biscuits (Paula spraying) and you can see that my. container will hold 12. So in the other two, I'm gonna pour a little water in (water pouring) because I don't want. my muffin tin to burn. All right, now we gonna start with some crushed pineapple. I think I discovered this, when I was wanting some different breads. I was wanting some easy breads (utensils clanging) and I really don't need, (fluid pouring) but like a 10 ounce can. All right, so we got our pineapple drained over here. (utensils clanging) And we got our pineapple juice that we're gonna come back to. Now let's see, I'm gonna need a half. a cup of brown sugar. And I keep my brown. sugar in this canister, along with a little piece of bread, because that keeps your brown sugar from getting so hard on you. So you see how easy it. was for me to dip in there and get that brown sugar. All right, so we got our brown sugar and we gonna add our. drained crushed pineapple, along with about a half a. stick of softened butter. It looks so good, doesn't it? When I was forming like this, I kinda wanted a quick and easy like pineapple upside-down cake. And I said well, how come I. can't do it with a can biscuit? (utensils clanging) All right. (utensils clanging) So now we're gonna take a spoonful of this and we gonna put it into the bottom of each. of our muffin cups. Hmm, looks just yummy already don't it? (utensils clanging) All right, so the only thing we need now, to make it a pineapple. upside-down cake is a cherry. So I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna stick a. cherry into each one, and I'm gonna stick it. all the way down in there and make sure it's hitting the bottom. Because when we take our biscuits out, we gonna invert them. And we want that cherry to be seen. Now we're just gonna take our biscuits. It scares me every time. they always do that. And you can use any brand of biscuit that you like. I love the buttermilk biscuits. All right, so remember a few minutes ago, I told you when these biscuits are ready, we gonna invert them so, our pineapple and our cherry is gonna be on the top and you know how children love cherries. So all I'm going to do now, is just take a little. of our pineapple juice and just pour right on. top of each biscuit. Just like that. So good, in 12 minutes, we're gonna have a biscuit that tastes so much like. pineapple upside-down cake. All right. Oh, I got two of them back here now. (oven closing) All right. I've got some pineapple. upside-down biscuits. Do y'all like pineapple? - Yeah.. - Yes and butter and brown sugar. Well, I've had them cooling over here. So we gonna have one more extra treat. Now I've got to get rid of this water in the muffin tins, and we gonna quickly, give them a turn. (Paula laughing) How's that for magic? - Yeah (laughs).. - Yeah. All right, there you go. Let's get you that pretty one. Mmm.. Isn't it good? Uh-huh (upbeat music playing) So until next time, to all you children, big and small, I send y'all love and best dishes from my kitchen to yours.;['postres']
yqCc_tDGKw8.json;"- Hey, y'all, it's Jamie Deen. I'm back in mama's kitchen and today I'm gonna share a delicious dessert recipe with y'all. It's a chocolate butterscotch. peanut butter cobbler. It's in one of mom's magazines. You never know what you. find laying around here. Look at my number one son right there with his Georgia shirt on and his mama. Whoo, that's a good looking woman. And there's mama too. She's good looking too. All right, y'all, so what. we're gonna do today, super easy, lot of. ingredients, several steps, but we'll go nice and slow. So I've taken my butter, first thing I'm gonna do is melt three quarters. of a stick of butter. Put it into our pan. Now the one rule that we're gonna repeat. a couple of times here, once everything is in here,. this is one of those things where we do not stir it together. This is a pour and a bake. So step one, our base of our cobbler here. I've got our flour. We've got some sugar. I've got cocoa powder. And we're gonna whisk in this milk. Let me see how much vanilla. I know that they always tell. y'all what it's supposed to be, and I'm terrible about measurements. One and a half teaspoons. So we'll go, boop, boop,. boop, boop, close enough. Be careful with your vanilla. Y'all measure that! I'm a trained professional. (Theresa laughs) (chuckling) I heard that, Theresa. I'm gonna whisk in our milk. I love cobblers, y'all,. and it is cobbler season. It's summer is heating up down here. Our peaches are back. You give me a peach cobbler with some ice cream on a summer night and you won't hear any. complaints outta me. I love blackberry cobblers. You don't see a lot of chocolate cobblers, so this is gonna be interesting to see. So I've got all of this whipped together. Now, while that's sitting there, I'm gonna do our dry ingredients. here in our second bowl. Y'all know what, I bet we should probably. take a little break right now because they tell me I. don't ever take breaks. So let's take a break, and when we come back, I'll be standing right. here and we'll do this. All right. And here I am. Okay. Next, cocoa powder. Peanuts. Granulated sugar. Brown sugar. And butterscotch morsels. I'm just gonna real simply. dry mix this together, making sure all this gets. incorporated really good. Mmm-mmm-mmm. I'm doing several recipes. here at mom's today and we're starting with dessert, which is always a good sign. So our brown sugar. Make sure you get all this matched up. This is a chocolate lover's dream here. Look at all this cocoa. All right, now here we go. with the ""do not stir."" Here is our wet bowl, our batter. It's gonna go right on. top of our melted butter. Y'all know not to stir cobblers, right? You never twist a cobbler. because you want that batter to cook its way up around the edges. Now on top of this, we're. gonna add our dry ingredients. Do not stir. Do not stir this. I know you want to. I want to. Wait till you see what I do next. So all of our dry ingredients are on here. I cannot stand it. I've just got to flatten. it out a little bit. I probably shouldn't. Now, this is the weird part. We are going to... It takes a scientist to. figure out mom's oven. We're gonna pour one and a. half cups of boiling water right on top of this. Look at that. Here comes Mama on the. speakerphone, as normal. Mama, I'm filming! - [Mama] Oh, I'm sorry. - [Jamie] It's all right. - [Mama] I gotta take my dog out... - [Jamie] Daggommit, Mama, I can't do but one thing at a time. - [Mama] (laughing) Sorry! - [Jamie] Okay. Okay. And. she's talking on the phone. This is our last half a cup. So we've got our batter went in right on top of our butter, and then our dry ingredients. went on top of the batter. And then we've added one and. a half cups of boiling water and never, not one. time, stirred any of it. So I'm gonna pop this into. the oven at probably 350. I'll tell you when it's done what I cooked it on and how long it took. Going in the oven, y'all! Ooh, stick around. Chocolate cobbler. Hey, y'all, looky-looky. This is our butterscotch. chocolate cobbler that we've made. And it just so happens,. one of my favorite people, my main man Henry, has found. a seat at the right time. He walked in and said, ""Mmm!"" And I said, ""Guess what, Hen?"" ""You're in position 1-A today."" So this is butterscotch chocolate cobbler. It has just come out of the oven and look how delicious. and gooey this looks. And I know you didn't. come for the green stuff. but I'm gonna garnish. it a little bit for you. - [Henry] Okay. - [Jamie] So y'all, it's. coming up on 4th of July and you're gonna have people over. You need a spoon. Theresa dear, please. - [Theresa] That's what I'm grabbing. - [Henry] Thank you.. - Thank you. - [Theresa] You're welcome. Oh look, let's see Theresa today. Look how beautiful she looks. Look, you look so nice today. - [Theresa] Thank you. - [Jamie] Here's your spoon, Henry. So listen, it's the 4th of July. You're gonna have friends. You're gonna have family around. Everybody wants some dessert. Why not take a chance to make something that'll surprise people, a. chocolate butterscotch cobbler, for this 4th of July. Put you a little bit of. ice cream on top of this. - [Henry] Mmm. - [Jamie] Great day in the morning. Henry, tell the people. - [Henry] That good.. - [Jamie] That good. Save a little bit of your morsels and a little bit of peanuts on top. Really super simple. Delicious. Your friends will be. lining up on July the 5th to see if there's any leftovers. Thanks for tuning in today, y'all. I'm Jamie Deen, and this is ""Good Food."" See you around the kitchen.";['postres']
Z6yDp4gmhqU.json;[Music] we're fixing to move on to an old standard of cookie now this particular recipe that I used was my grandmother Paul's and Grandma made hers involved well and sometimes I do them that way too but over the years I just started making them in fingers but in the meantime I've got two and a half cups of plain flour or all-purpose flour 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar we're just going to mix those two ingredients together this cookie is very very easy but it does take a while because they have to bake for about 20 or 25 minutes which is what about 15 minutes longer than a normal cookie whoops feels very dough girl all right now I'm going to start this off by using a wooden spoon to just kind of cut that butter in there a little alright now I'm going to put in some vanilla flavoring and if you wanted to kind of shake your flavoring up you could do just about any kind of flavoring you want to orange flavoring would be nice almond would be delicious in there all right now I'm going to add our chopped pecans and you can see how quickly let me get my hands in here coming together I still think that some of my best utensils are the ones that God gave me these two hands right here they make great spoons and mixers so like I said my grandmother Paul used to roll these into balls but I'm going to roll mine into fingers and I just remembered our oven is on 350 from our pecans so I'm going to reach over here and turn that to 325 and if my hands are not too greasy I'm just going to fan it to cool it down for a minute because we're ready to put these in the oven all right so here we go into the oven let's go over here and check you can see how they swelled up a little those are perfect just barely a light brown then I can right now we're just going to toss these in our powdered sugar while they're warm and look at sticking so nicely got me a plate [Music];['postres']

zJX08DjYt3o.json;hey y'all i'm paula dean you know there's nothing better than instant gratification and today i want to show y'all some of my favorite dessert recipes that are fast simple and yet scrumptious but before we get to that i want to take y'all to savannah coffee roasters for some fresh beans to complete this bittersweet affair and then it'll be time for us to head back to my kitchen first up is gonna be nutty coconut macaroons after that things are gonna get fruity with my hair savignon and then i want to pay tribute to my friend mae dawson by preparing her famous sugar cream pie and finally my yummy blueberry dumplings so i hope you brought your sweet tooth because desserts are on me today it's all about simple desserts now when we're talking simple desserts there's nothing better than a great cup of coffee and today i'm gonna show you what i drink and it'll pick you up and get your morning going so y'all come with me cause we're gonna go get us some great coffee when i'm serving up a perfect cup of coffee to go with my desserts i always start with a fresh ground coffee bean from savannah coffee roasters now y'all know that here in the south we're big tea drinkers but coffee is fast becoming a partner in our cooking culture and laura the store manager keeps an impressive inventory of over 30 different varieties they carry the finest arabica beans from columbia kenya and jamaica as well as fantastic blends like the good old savannah blend and the good and evil blend after you buy your coffee it's best to keep whole beans stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place like maybe your freezer or refrigerator and the sooner newly ground beans are brewed the better i bet this coffee is gonna be just delicious [Music] this coffee is gonna taste so good today cause it's kinda nippy outside and i can't hardly wait to make it it's gonna be wonderful uh laura was so helpful and you know i decided on the georgia pecan it's gonna taste yummy with the desserts we're making today and before we get started on the coffee though we've got to get these going and the first dessert up is coconut macaroons and they're so simple y'all it takes about 10 minutes so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start by separating our eggs we're gonna do a little meringue to go into our coconut we're gonna start by beating these egg whites and i'm actually saving these yellows because as soon as i finish with this we're gonna be making pear savignon did i say that right sometimes i get real confused with that word my southern tongue will get all screwed up in my mouth so anyway pear savage or something like that y'all all right now i've got my egg whites going and i put just a little prima tarta in that to make them really stiff and while that's going i'm going to come over here this is so easy i'm just using flake coconut that comes in a bag in fact on the back of the bags you'll actually see i'm putting about an eighth a teaspoon of salt you'll actually find a recipe on the bag now i don't know if that one calls for egg whites or not but this is sweetened condensed milk all right now so my egg whites are done so i'm going to turn those off and in my macaroons today i'm going to be adding a couple of teaspoons of almond rather than vanilla i just love the flavor of almond now all we have to do is incorporate that condensed milk with our coconut and it doesn't take but a second all right now we're just gonna fold in our egg whites and like i said that's gonna make it so nice and fluffy and y'all remember i've told you before you just have to pick your days when you're doing meringues because if it's raining outside they just don't want to make so these did so good today because the sun's shining and it's really really dry outside all right so we're just going to kind of fold that in just like that working our spatula down and over like i said the recipes on the bags of coconut may differ and like i said some of them don't even call for the egg whites but i think they do so much better we're gonna spray this lightly so our macaroons will come up easily and i have found that an ice cream scoop works real real well for this but for the time being i'm just going to use two big tablespoons drop them about like that all right i've got the macaroons on our sheet and we're going to put these in a 350 preheated oven and we're going to bake them for about maybe eight minutes i've got those in the oven now and i've got another tray here in this oven and they've been cooking about eight minutes so we're gonna check and see what they look like oh and they look good these are actually a little tinier than the ones i made i think i got a heavy hand with those that i just put in all right let's see how they're gonna do oh yeah they're gonna do nicely don't those look delicious and you saw how little bit of time effort and ingredients that it took to make these wonderful homemade macaroons they're so good i can't hardly wait to have one but we better move on over here and make that savagne i was telling y'all about for this i'm gonna put four egg yolks into the bowl and i'm gonna put oh gosh just a pinch of salt and some foix sugar and i'm just gonna mix that up and this is one of those things that we're gonna have to stir and stay on top of or you'll have a bowl of scrambled eggs so we're gonna have to really really watch and make sure that they don't scramble up on us all right now i'm gonna add a fourth of a cup of cooking cherry but you can use a good drinking cherry if you want to in fact i would suggest that if you've got some on hand but if not the cooking cherry will work fine all right now i'm going to put it over our water and this is something that you're not gonna walk away from so this is the boring part it's gonna take about eight minutes so why don't i take a quick break and when we come back we'll have it ready and um i don't think anybody will miss just one [Music] [Music] hey y'all welcome back and i've got this custard going so good now what we're gonna do now is we're to take this of totally away from the heat and i'm actually going to pour it into another bowl because we're fixing to beat some cream and fold into this and it's going to make it nice and fluffy and i've got a little sweetened whipped cream so we're just gonna fold this into our custard you know you can't go wrong with eggs and sugar and whipped cream see how it's becoming a pretty soft yellow color now that we're mixing the white into it today i'm serving this as a dessert but this is one of those dishes that you could actually serve as a salad if you wanted kind of a sweeter salad with a meal i'm actually using pears that i canned but you can just go to the grocery store and buy the regular canned pears and they'll work nicely for you and you want to make sure that you grab pear halves not sliced pears during pear season this year i actually made some pear preserves and michael and i and just enjoy eating them so much look at that we're just gonna dollop a little bit on there and i've got some fresh mint here and i'm just going to sprinkle a few raspberries on it look how pretty that looks and with no trouble and so simple and so easy to make it's so good while this is very good i'm in a hurry to move on because i want to show y'all a recipe that was sent to me from one of my guests that come into the restaurant her name is carol rudd so she has sent me the recipe for may dawson's hoosier sugar cream pie it's nothing but sweetened whipped cream sugar like a cup and a third of sugar and we're going to use about three quarters of a cup of milk and a little flour so we're just going to give that a stir people send me recipes all the time and i can't tell you how much i love it all right now we're going to pour this into a 9 inch unbaked pie shell now you can make your own crust or you can just use the frozen one like i'm doing and because we're doing simple desserts today i opted to go with the frozen crust because we want to make this quick and easy all right now i've got some butter here and i'm just going to kind of pinch it up and just drop it all over the pie i'm doing it just like carol says she does it and now i'm gonna just grate it with a little nutmeg and this almost makes it taste like an egg custard pie there's nothing like fresh nutmeg it's so much better than the ground kind that you buy at the store all right now i'm going to put this into a 450 degree oven and i'm going to let it bake for about 10 minutes and then we're going to turn the oven down to 350 and let it cook another 25 minutes and it's going to be a little jiggly so you'll want to be careful when you put it in your oven got to have a a steady hand and in the meantime i've already baked another one and i've got it sitting right here and it should be nice and cooled it is it's just just a wee little bit warm but not too much i think we can go ahead and cut it now i'd like to show you all a little trick that i use when i'm cutting pies because you know you can sometimes mess it up trying to get it out so i'm going to show you how i like to get that very first piece out but of course if it messes up that's all right too because then that makes it legal to eat before the family gets to it now some people like their pies cut in eighths some people like their pies cut into sixth i don't have to tell you what we do at my house so all i'm gonna do with these scissors is i'm gonna come in here and i'm gonna snip right through that fold so you can see that the pie just kind of slips away and that makes it easy for me to just slip right in and lift out that piece of pie yum it looks great doesn't it and you know i don't even have any fresh whipped cream to serve on it so you know what i think i'm gonna do i had some custard left over from those pears i'm gonna come over here and i think i'm gonna get just a little bit of that and get me a couple of cherries going here we'll use a little piece of mint on it too just to make me feel like i'm eating my vegetables you know and eating healthy look how pretty that looks oh carol this looks so good it's delicious coming up next y'all blueberry dumplings [Music] [Music] all right y'all it's time to make those blueberry dumplings i just love the word dumplings you know when you hear that word you know it's gonna be decadent and these are we're gonna add a quart of fresh blueberries into a medium-sized saucepan we're gonna add a cup of sugar and for your water now it depends on if you like a lot of liquid with your dumplings you can put anywhere from one cup of water to two and i think i'm gonna use about a cup and a half that looks about right and i'm just going to give that a stir so i'm going to put the lid on so that'll boil faster and the next thing we're going to do is just make up our dumplings and it's so easy it's just not even funny we're gonna start with about a cup of flour a teaspoon of baking powder a little bit of sugar and just a pinch of salt and i'm gonna just incorporate those for a minute and then we're gonna cut a stick of butter into that little bit of flour now you can do this a couple of different ways you can use a pastry cutter or you can use a fork and we're just going to kind of cut that in until it looks like a real coarse cornmeal that was a good bit of butter for that little bit of flour wasn't it you know it's gonna be so good let me check on our blueberries cause we can't can't put our dumplings in until our syrup is nice and bubbly we want a full rolling ball when we drop our dumplings in all right so now i'm just going to add the milk and give that a quick stir and they're going to be kind of just a little sticky this is so good on a cool night michael loves a bowl of ice cream but when the weather gets nippy it's nice to make this and you got your hot from your dumplings and your cold from your ice cream it's a great combination all right let's check on our blueberries we're to a nice rolling ball so we're just going to take our dumplings and just drop them down in that liquid it looks like a a grape soda doesn't it [Music] and with dumplings we don't want to stir we want to just shake our pot and get them down in there and make sure they're all covered good all right now i'm going to turn that down a little bit and all we're going to do is put that lid on there and let it cook for about 20 minutes and i'm not going to raise the lid as i'm working here in the kitchen i may just give it a shake but i'm not gonna open it up and stir it or anything but in the meantime i've got another pot ready oh look it's piping hot look at those dumplings is that gorgeous or what um i think i just swallowed my tongue oh my gracious i just love those dumplings i'm gonna get me out one more oh my goodness now you can't eat this without ice cream i just love ice cream with my dumplings and i've got some vanilla ice cream right here and here we go how gorgeous is that and i'm gonna need me a spoon for tasting and i'll cool it off with that ice cream a little bit i wish y'all were here it is so wonderful what am i doing next i can't even remember the perfect cup of coffee to go with this perfect dessert [Music] [Music] and i told you i was going to show you how to make the perfect cup of coffee this is called a french press and it's amazingly fast now we're just going to take our lid off and we have ground up our beans and i'm gonna put three tablespoons in ours now we're gonna take our just boiling water and pour it over our grounds just a little bit and we're gonna let that steep depending on how strong you like your coffee and i'm gonna go ahead and push the cylinder down all right so let's see what we've got oh now that's just the color i like it a nice medium brown you can't get any quicker than this and i've got a little sweetened whipped cream but you can use a frothy milk that's real good on it you know i live with a man that's got the biggest sweet tooth and it's important to me that i have some desserts around for him to eat on without spending my whole day making them michael and michelle his daughter love those coconut macaroons now for those real chocolate lovers in your house you can take these luscious little macaroons

ZtCWykmlqFw.json;- This recipe is walking. me down mystery lane. Y'all, I've formulated this way of brownies when I was still. working outta my house. And I just kind of got tired. of the same old brownies. So I said, I'm gonna think of some way to just. shuffle it up a little bit. So I am going to take. four tablespoons of butter and put 'em in my pan and melt that. And then I'm going to add my pecans to it and a cup of brown sugar. But in the meantime, I. just use a box brownie, you know just whatever is your favorite. What is that? Oh, I've never used this kind. It has a chocolate syrup in it. Yay. Little extra chocolate. never hurt anything. Did it. And I'm assuming that you just mix it. - [Teresa] You just mix it in. I make that one all the time. - Oh, you do? Add brownie mixin's Okay. - [Teresa] Trying to. throw you a curve ball. - Yeah, I like it. I like it. I like to try new. things, but to be honest, I always use the Duncan Hines chewy. Cause I just found that. gave me a chewy brownie which was what I was going after. Okay. All right. I think I'm gonna get. a little bowl for this and mix my oil, I'm going right by the package of the brownie mix y'all. An egg and water. I think it called a third,. a fourth of a cup of water. A third of a cup of. vegetable oil and one egg. So we're just gonna beat. those, get back in that bowl. All right. So we're just gonna fold. that in and stir it. The directions says, you know,. until everything's combined. I thought I was getting. out a big enough bowl but I could have stood. - [Teresa] That one's. going, I'm watching it. - I know it. I could have stood. - [Teresa] Now we're here. No, I'm gonna make it. I could have stood one bowl up though. One more size up. I'm telling you what Teresa. is on the ball today. She is. I don't pick it up and. use it before she is. - [Teresa] Well, I'm trying. not to grab the things. I believe you might need. - Go into the sink with. it, which is wonderful. Okay. I hear my butter starting to bubble. I'm gonna go ahead and throw in my pecans. Now you can use any kind. of nut you like, you know I've gotten where I'm. a big fan of walnuts, and oh my gosh, I've always. loved macadamia nuts. Those things are high as a cat's back. Y'all ever buy macadamia nuts? - [Teresa] Not really. They're good in cookies - Uh-huh. I love them. But you can see, this is. getting mixed up really well. You don't have to pull out. any kind of mixer for this. You can just do it with. a little elbow grease and that's all you need. All right, let's see, I'm. gonna stir this together and I'm gonna add my brown sugar. Let that brown sugar kind of melt. And this is what I called. my caramelized brownies and people really seem to like them a lot. (pan scraping) All right. So you can see our brown sugar is starting to melt a little bit, starting to melt into that butter. (pan scrapping) Theresa would you mind getting. me the vanilla flavoring? - [Teresa] Not at all. I take it. You're gonna add something to it. - I change every recipe. I have ever made y'all. Yeah I think a little vanilla. flavoring would be nice. Don't you? We just gonna cook this for. a few minutes y'all not long. And while we're waiting. on that, I am gonna take-- Huh? I don't know. It's, I made some in like a,. looked like a vinegar jar. One time you see that? (can spraying) - [Teresa] I see one. - The recipe calls for 13x9x2. But this is an 11x8 that I'm using. I think a 13x9 might be a little too thin. You found it?. - [Teresa] I thought this is - [Teresa] It, the one. that I got in my hand. - Yes. See, that's an old vinegar jar. Eddie and I will make him vanilla one day. Huh? - [Teresa] I said threw me for a loop. - Okay. I'm gonna shut that off. And you know, you don't, anytime you're using a vanilla flavoring or any kind of flavoring, you don't want your vanilla flavoring to cook because it will cook. the flavor out. Hear it? Hear that? It made it a little bit more liquidy too which I like that. Okay. So I'm gonna move back. over here to our brownie mix. I'm gonna spread this. out into our baking dish. That extra chocolate made. that real chocolatey. Doesn't it. - [Teresa] Mm-hmm - Okey doke Theresa. I dropped the dirty. - [Teresa] And I almost missed it. - I know. She's busy over there eating - [Teresa] Strawberries from. one of our earlier ones. - Yep from the strawberry tiramisu. Okay so you just wanna take your a spatula and spread that out evenly in your pan. And I'm gonna wash my wash my hands so I won't get chocolate everywhere. Okay. Now we just gonna try. to evenly spread this on top and it's going kind of. caramelize these brownies. Wanna be careful cause. that's hot and sugar hot sugar can, it can hurt. It can get real hot. So you don't wanna, you. don't wanna burn yourself. You know how hot syrups can. get when you're making candy and you have to cook it till it's a boil. Now that's some of the hottest. hot in the world right there. Okay. I'm trying to get this. So every bite somebody will. have a little bite of caramel. (pan scraping) Oh, it smells so good. That vanilla just brought it to life. Okay. So that's just that simple. So we're gonna put this in a 325 degree oven and. we're gonna cook it for what maybe 25 minutes. I can't remember what I said. - [Teresa] And this section - I do hope y'all will try. this caramelized brownie recipe because you know, it's just a nice change. It is so hot. I'm actually not gonna. be able to taste it. I mean, it's steaming hot and it's kind of gooey in the center, but as it cools, it will come right out. I don't know that it's gonna. come out though right now. I don't know. Mm. But we'll try. It's like gooey. So it cuts much better. than that y'all cool. I never tried to cut one. straight outta the oven. (blowing air) You know, every time I make brownies I would frost them with a. chocolate frosting and nuts. And like I said, I just,. you know, you get tired of making the same thing. over and over and over again. And since I did did this five days a week I just wanted to try to. change around the brownies see it's already starting. to get real firm. But if y'all were looking. for something for labor day I think you would enjoy this one. So whatever you doing y'all be safe and we send y'all love and best dishes just like every other day.;['postres']
zT_Ao0eDmcI.json;"- Michael, I'm so glad you're here. - [Michael] Me too. (Paula laughing) - Poor thing. His back and his sciatica, we ready to part ways with. that sciatica, aren't we? All right, so anyway Michael, I don't know if people. still do this anymore, I don't, I don't have little children anymore so I don't know what's happening, but I just love it when people used to take the time to do nice things, like if your child's been invited to spend the night with. somebody for the first time, it's just nice to have your child take a little gift, or your grandchild if. you're overseeing them. So I'm gonna put all the ingredients for these wonderful simple s'mores. Have you tasted it, Mike? - [Michael] No, I was. wondering what it was. - It's a simple s'mores bar. - Mm. - [Paula] Isn't it delicious? - So if I go to spend. the night with somebody, you would- - Yes, I will, I will do this jar up for you to take to your. spend the night partner. - [Michael] Okay. - But give me chance to get this arm wound up, okay? (Paula laughing) Oh. (Michael laughing) - [Michael] Well apparently - [Paula] I'm telling you, we couldn't get one good. person between the two of us. So, I'm going to share. this simple s'mores recipe with you, and the first layer to go in the jar is the miniature gram crackers. I think they're bears or something. Yes, it's a little bear. (Paula Laughs) Perfect bite size. - [Michael] Can vegetarians eat those? - Vegetarians? I don't know. - [Michael] Since it's animals. - Oh. (laughter) All right, the next layer, that was a cup and a half. of gram cracker bear bites. - [Michael] How you going. to get it out of that jar? - You going to pour it out. - [Michael] Oh. - (Paula Laughs) I'm. going to take a hammer and crack it. - [Michael] If they have. them like this then- - You so smart! The next layer is a cup. and a half of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Or you can use milk chocolate - [Michael] Oh that's for me. to take on my overnight party - Yes! This is for you. to give the mother and tell her you wanted to. bring her a little treat for being nice and having. you over to spend the night. Alright, a cup and half. of the chocolate chips. (Banging jar on counter) Alright, how much brown sugar is this? Half a cup of brown sugar. So we're going to pack. that down in there good. - [Michael] Might need. a hammer to get it out - Hm? - [Michael] Might need. a hammer to get it out if you're going to pack it down in there. (Paula laughs) - No. Brown sugar is very airy, Michael. So, got to wash my hands. - So do you get what. we're doing yet, Mikey? - [Michael] Yeah I do. - So, I'm going to put a ribbon on this along with the directions, the name of the recipe,. and the directions. And hopefully, the mother. that you're giving it to will make them for y'all. I can't tell which is the. right and which is the back. Alright, so, I'm going to tie. it up here around the rim. And if you keep old scraps of cloth around you could cut a square and. put the square of cloth between the top and the rim and make like a little house coat for it. This is a pretty sweet ribbon. And it's got a little light wire in it so that makes it work so good. Okay those are cut pretty good. (ribbon cutting) These scissors have about had it. Let me see if this is any better. - [Eddie] Use the one with the orange. - Okay, that one's no good either. Eddie, you just went and. bought a bunch of scissors. - [Eddie] Those are them. (laughs) - Okay. Yeah. Perfect. How sweet is that? I'm going to clean this. edge up a little bit because it was kind of gnarly looking. Okay. Now, I'm going to take a little of this ribbon. Isn't that sweet, place these seeds and watch them grow. Oh my gosh! The seeds. are still in here, Eddie! Oh my gosh, this is from Bubbles isn't it? Look! I got to go out there. and plant those seeds! ""Plant these seeds and watch them grow"" and watch love grow. I don't know it kind. of looks like Bubbles. Like sissy's writing. I don't know, I miss that. All right. I don't know if I'm cutting that or not. I think I am. Okay. All right, so we have printed. out the recipe for this. And I used a hole puncher. to punch the holes. Now we can do it this way,. where the letters out, or the letters in. And I think I'm going to put it I think I'm going to put it where it's out so mommy won't have. any trouble reading it. (Scissors cutting) Okay, sonny boy now you take this - [Michael] Those would be. neat like Christmas gifts - They'd be wonderful Christmas gifts. So you take this one to Mrs. Jones and tell her that you. hope she enjoys this gift from our family to hers. Okay? - [Michael] Thank you. Could. you just go ahead and fix mine? So I can just carry it in a pan - (Paula laughs) And you be a good boy, don't forget to say yes mam and no mam. - [Michael] Yes mam. - (Paula laughs) I just think that's a neat idea, yall, with summer being here,. and the kids out of school, they're probably going. to be doing this a lot. - [Woman] Paula, remind. them that the only thing they need is a stick of butter. - Oh! Okay, yeah. And it's. on the directions, right? - [Woman] It's on the directions. but all you add to that is a stick of butter and. press it into a 9in x 9in pan. - 9 by 9 pan, that's right. - [Woman] And bake it for 15 minutes. And there you have it. - How simple? How simple. I grant you that's easier than going out and starting a fire, and. doing s'mores on the grill. (Paula laughs) Right? - [Michael] Well it's fun to do that. - Yes it's fun. So, I'm so glad you like them Michael. So that's it. That's a summer time tip.";['postres']

zvtnOHI2VHw.json;- Come join me in the kitchen today y'all because I am making my. sweet husband a treat. Michael has the biggest sweet tooth, and he loves this particular dessert. A cannoli. I'm not wild about 'em. I'm not wild about 'em. I think 'cause they're. not sweet enough for me. I'm thinking, you know, it. needs to be really really sweet, but Michael loves 'em and when we go to an Italian restaurant he always, at the end of the meal, he. has a cup of coffee espresso, double shot of espresso and a cannoli. So, I'm getting ready. to put this together, it's a simple recipe y'all. I am taking a third of. a cup of heavy cream, Okay, get every bit of. that goodness out of there, half of my powdered sugar. Oh, and I meant to tell y'all that I'm actually halfing the. original recipe cause us three, (laughs) don't need to eat. - [Theresa] We don't have discipline. - I know. - [Theresa] So we feel that we. have to eat, clear our plate. - I've been a plate. clearer all of my life. And I'll finish off my life. being a (laughs) plate cleaner. - [Theresa] We're just. minimal, minimalizing. - Yes, yes, all right. I've got my cinnamon, and I'm gonna beat this up a little bit before I add the amaretto. (mixing) Get it nice and stiff. I want to talk to y'all. about the actual cannoli. We picked these up from our Bay three that's located in our grocery store. You can go to a real bakery that deals in nothing but pastries and get it there. You can order them online. or you can make your own. I'm saying let's make. it easy on ourselves. - [Woman] And they dipped. it in chocolate already. - Yes! Yes, because my recipe tells you to dip your cannoli in. chocolate, melted chocolate. But see the grocery. stores saved us a step, and I'm a firm believer. in saving steps if you can and not compromise your recipe. (mixing) In goes the rest of our. powdered sugar and amaretto. I like amaretto. I think it's called a white Russian. (mixing) Okie dokie. That's tasting real good y'all. I wanna make sure this is nice and stiff, because you, we've got our. ricotta to fold into this, and I just don't want it running. All right, so I'm going. to take our pistachios, and I'm going to fold them. into our ricotta, or mix 'em, kind of hard to fold this, but I am going to fold this into that. (mixing) Have ya pick up this bowl so I can get a grip on this. MM, those pistachios smell. incredible, the nuttiness. I love pistachios too. Okay. So we're going to fold this in, and we want to do it kind of gentle. - [Theresa] I saw that, Eddie. - What did he do? - [Theresa] He took a little. bit of the whipped cream off of the mixer. - Okay, here we go. The last of the ricotta,. how do they say it? I know I don't say it they supposed, like a true Italian, ricotta. or something like that. It's ricotta to me. (light laughing) Okay, that ricotta is really thick, so I'm actually going to have. to give that a little stir. Folding is good, but I feel like that was very thick ricotta. Okay, so if you don't have a. piping bag, I actually have one but it's like this size,. y'all, I don't want to fool with a gallon size pastry bag. So I just took me a little plastic bag, and I nipped the corner out of it. And you don't want to put a tip in there because those, nuts the. hole has to be big enough for your nuts to go through it. 'cause the pistachios are just rough cut. So, and I've saved in my bowl. So, I've got plenty of hands. So I'm just going to fill that bag full. And after we get- - [Woman] Oh, I'm sorry,. but just to let them know about the pastry shells, you can also, the bakery will also have the larger ones. You can either get larger. ones and smaller ones, and again, we're on a diet. - Yeah. You know, I would feel better, (dogs barking) Y'all hush, I would feel. better eating two small ones. - [Theresa] I know. - Just, it's a mind trick. - [Man] Or three small ones. - Or three small ones, yes. Alright, so I'm going to shake this up Where's my hole? - [Theresa] See the sad part is- - I can't even see the hole! - [Theresa] Did you cut it? - I did, I cutted it. - [Theresa] I don't even need the shell. I could just eat the filling. - I know. All right, so here we go. I've cut my hole. And now we just gon fill, fill, fill, yum, and then when I go to serve. them, y'all, I will dust them with some extra powdered sugar. Now this is kind of soft, so, I forgot to seal ma bag up. So you will need to put. these in your refrigerator. Get that in there. - [Theresa] You could probably. make that ahead of time. Put it in your pastry bag,. and just have it ready to go. - Oh my gosh, absolutely. - [Theresa] And do 'em right before the - Yes. And then squirt 'em right before your guests arrive. I like it coming out of the end a lot you know, don't, don't gyp. me on the, on the cream. Now these will need to sit in your refrigerator for two hours because that heavy cream and ricotta needs to firm up again. And did I say, I think I. said that when I serve these, I will dust them with. extra powdered sugar. Did I say that? - [Man] Yes. - [Theresa] Do you want me. to get you a little extra? - No, 'cause these got to go. in the refrigerator, Theresa. - [Theresa] Do you really. think they're gonna make it to the refrigerator? - I don't know, I was. kinda thinking maybe, and you know what, and. I'm not throwing away this cheese mixture because. I know Michael and me, I don't know about y'all too,. but we like the inside part. - [Theresa] So yeah. - So if we feel like I've. not filled 'em properly, we have this. - [Theresa] Or you could put. a whole dollop around it, and put it in the middle, and then you have inside and outside. - Uh oh. So there we go, just that simple. The pistachios were good, over the top. Taste it, Theresa. - [Theresa] Yum. Yum. - Isn't that wonderful. - [Theresa] I said I don't need the shell. - You wanna look at- Me too! You want a lick Eddie? You know you do. There you go. There's your lollipop. So, two hours in the refrigerator, dust 'em with a little powdered sugar when you get ready to serve 'em, and people will think that. you have been working all day. So, if you've got a sweet. husband or a sweet wife, you want to fix a treat for them, this is an easy one. And Lord knows life is hard enough so there's some things we wanna easy. And fun!

_DMcJ04FZd8.json;"- Hey, y'all. I'm doing a special show. in honor and in memory of one of the most wonderful men here that lived here in Savannah. His name was Stan Strickland,. and he's The Candy Man. I called him Stan, My Candy Man. He was one of the nicest,. unselfish, kind men you could ever hope to meet. Now, Michael, how long. have you known Stan? - I don't know, a long time. - Since, the beginning of time, yeah. - Since the middle '70s. - Yes, and, of course,. I didn't get to meet him until I moved here to. Savannah, but he and his family started River Street Sweets, and then Stan broke off from his children that kept run, kept that going, and he opened Savannah Candy Kitchen, and both of 'em are just great. They make the most wonderful. pralines, don't they, Michael? - [Michael] Yeah, I think so. - You can walk in either. place, River Street Sweets or - - [Michael] Savannah Candy Kitchen. - Savannah Candy Kitchen, yeah,. and you'll find them making, they have a big old copper bowl up there, and they're making pralines and, of course, they're giving out samples, 'cause they know if you ever. sample it, you gonna want it. But Stan actually has appeared with me on my show several times over the years. And anytime I'd call. and ask him, you know, he would say, ""Absolutely, Paula."" But this town is gonna miss him. We went to his funeral. Saturday, I think it was. And I've never seen that many. people at a funeral as Stan's. So, he was just so well loved. So, I remember when Stan, one time he was on my show with me, I can't remember if it was. ""Best Dishes"" or ""Home Cooking,"" or which one it was, but I. remember him making pralines, and that's what their two candy. stores are really known for is those pralines. They got a thousand other candies, but this is in memory of Stan, so I'm gonna try to make his pralines. And I'm gonna start with, let me see, a cup and a half of sugar and a cup and a half of light brown sugar. You know, these are really simple to make, but the timing, it's all. about timing, you know? I mean, you got to cook them from, to the proper temperature. So, I'm gonna mix these up, and I'm gonna add, like, 1/4. to 1/2 a teaspoon of salt. Stan was also involved in a lot. of restaurants here in town, wasn't he, Michael? - [Michael] Oh, yeah. - [Paula] Do you have any Stan stories? - [Michael] Um. - [Paula] Any you can tell in public? - No, he was just the most. generous guy you'd ever meet. - He was. He was. - I mean, he, I know he told me to take a, go to Key West and use his boat. - [Paula] Uh huh. Yeah, he - - Which, not many people do that. - You know, he invited Bobby and the girl that he. was dating at the time down to The Bahamas to go fishing. And Bobby said they fished. for about two or three days with Stan, and he said it was so much fun, but that's the kind of person he was. All right, now this calls for three tablespoons of dark syrup, and you'll see, I sprayed my spoon. - [Michael] Don't spill it. - I know it. So see that syrup will just. roll right out of there. All right. That's one, two. Three. So, if you've ever been. in the Atlanta Airport, there is a Savannah Candy. Kitchen on Concourse - - [Michael] Is it C? - Or is it B? - [Michael] Yeah, I think it might be B. - Yeah, I'm thinking it's B. So, if you've never dropped. in there, just go in and say, I sure would like my sample of pralines, but you know what? - [Michael] Turtles are my favorite. - I know you love the. turtles, but you know what became my favorite was. the chocolate pralines. Oh my goodness. I remember at Christmas, you know, when we would work with the. Salvation Army, you know, and we would take care of some families that otherwise wouldn't have a Christmas. And naturally, I would call Stan and say, can you help me, Candy Man? I need some goodies for these families I'm trying to do for, and. always, he sent so much. He sent enough that I. was able to keep some at the house, a little at the house. I mean, he would send that much. All right, so I added three. tablespoons of dark corn syrup. And now, I'm gonna add one. cup of evaporated milk, and evaporated milk is the. one that comes in the can in case you - - [Michael] Why do they. call it evaporated? - 'Cause it'll evaporate. on you real quick. I don't know. - [Michael] Don't look evaporated to me. - I don't know, Michael. I'll get the can and let you read everything about it, and then you can tell us all. How 'bout that? I know when I'm making. my macaroni and cheese, I don't want to use anything. but evaporated milk. It's just so rich and creamy. All right. Now, I don't know if I told y'all, but I buttered the side of my pan. So when I get to cooking,. it won't stick to the sides, because we are gonna cook. this until it starts balling. We're gonna cook it to a soft ball. - [Michael] Soft boil? - Soft ball, B-A-L-L. - [Michael] Doesn't sound like it. - Over medium heat. So, this is gonna take a few minutes. So, just sit back and get you some coffee. or go to the bathroom. Get you a soda, eat you an apple. Everybody but you, Michael,. you can't leave me. Okay, y'all. I think we're there, to 236. I'm gonna remove this from the heat. I'm gonna turn off my eye. I'm gonna pull out my thermometer. - [Michael] Right. - Be careful. That's hot, Theresa. And the little piece came off. That's all right. So, I'm gonna let this. cool for about 10 minutes, and then we gonna beat it. I think I might have, since. I messed up my shoulder, I think you're gonna have to. beat this praline for me, okay? I put, actually put the timer on this, so it's been sitting 10 minutes, Michael. And now, we're add a teaspoon. and some extra drippings. - [Michael] What is that? Vanilla? - It's Paula Deen's pure vanilla. extract, and it's so good. So good. - Okay, start? - Yeah. Yeah. So, we gonna have to beat this, and you can't do like. a little tiny back rub. You got beat it. - Okay, well, that's. all you need to tell me. That's my style. - We're putting in half a cup of pecans. - [Michael] Most of the time. you say, you got to fold it in. - You wanna change everything. around. Just beat it. Just beat it. Yeah. Beat it like you mean it. There you go. Now that's the way to hold it onto it. You was doing a little. Cece, a little Cece beat there for a second. All right. I'm gonna get our ice cream scoop ready, and by ready I mean, I'm spraying it so it won't stick to it. as we're dipping it up. Probably gonna take a couple of minutes until candy is slightly thick. and begins to lose its gloss. You know, that's what pralines. and divinity have in common. You have to, as soon. as you start seeing 'em lose that gloss, ooh, buddy, have to work quick. So did I, I mentioned, I. told everybody, didn't I, Eddie, about, if you're. in the Atlanta Airport, and I think it's Concourse B, when you come off the escalator, Stan's Savannah Candy Kitchen is right there to the left, and - - [Eddie] I think they've got. a few locations other than, you know, in Atlanta. - I think they're kind of - - [Eddie] Charlotte, maybe. - I wouldn't be surprised. I can't keep up with Stan. I know I was on - - He had one in Nashville, too, didn't he? - [Eddie] Yeah. - I can't remember. I know I had introduced him. to Bob at Pigeon Forge at the, on the island, yeah, and I think Bob was in. conversation with Stan about possibly opening up a. Savannah Candy Kitchen in, where our restaurant is on. the island in Pigeon Forge, but he was a busy man, and I vaguely remember something. I used to be on QVC, and do you remember about. that story, Theresa? - [Theresa] What story? - About when I was on QVC? Because now, if y'all ever watch QVC, Stan and Tonya's youngest son, Brett. - [Theresa] Rhett.. - Rhett. - Brett. - Rhett.. - [Theresa] Rhett. - Rhett, like Rhett Butler? - [Theresa] Like Rhett Butler, exactly. - He's on QVC now selling their products. So, Stan always had a. good catalog business, you remember, Theresa? - [Theresa] Absolutely. - Had a great catalog business but, you know, he just knew, he knew how to play and. he knew how to work hard. - He was good at both of 'em. - Mm hmm, real good at both of 'em. - Paula, we're about to. lose our gloss here now. - You think? I don't think so, but I, my. hat is off to Stan's two sons and a daughter and his wife, Tonya. I think Tonya has been a. great asset to the business, as well as Stan and his children. All right, you might need. to let me kind of feel it. You gonna let me feel it? - You go on ahead. - [Paula] Okay. You just keep beating. Yeah. You just keep beating, baby. All right, let me just,. I'll do one little drop, and we'll just see what. it looks like, okay? But it's not losing its gloss yet. See, it's still real shiny, so, beat away. Beat away, boy. - [Theresa] Three hours later. - [Eddie] Well, you can see. the difference in the color. - [Paula] Yeah. - [Eddie] It's a little more milky. - [Paula] Yeah, and I guess, you know, you could use your hand mixer, but when it starts. losing its gloss, I mean, you have to work quick. Theresa, I might need another. cookie sheet, honey bunny. - [Theresa] Okay. - [Paula] Oh gosh, my shoulder. See, that's starting to. Oh. I can't hardly dip in the. pot 'cause my shoulder. We just a bunch of old has. beens, Mikey, you and me, - [Michael] Need me to help you? - No, I'm bringing the pot down some. We gonna need another. - [Theresa] Here you go. - Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna let you, uh huh. - Finish? - Yeah. Let me get this one, see? Look at that. See, it's, see how. that's losing its gloss. You got to work quick. You the man. So, that's it, y'all. I could have cooked 'em. another two degrees. They were just fixing. lose their gloss, though, when we dipped up the end of the pot. So I'm gonna have to. let these cool some more before I can pick 'em up and enjoy one. But every time I see a praline. or a piece of candy, Stan, I'll think about you. And I hope the best for. Tonya and the three children. And I know how badly. y'all are gonna miss him, and all of his friends. are right there with you. So, to the good times, Stan. Love and best dishes, y'all. - Rest in peace, Stanley.";['postres']
_gD9L5uGfyc.json;"- Listen, y'all are in for a treat. If you will take down this recipe, if you like baklava. You don't have to go to. all the trouble though, to make like a real baklava. I've got such a wonderful doable recipe in ""December's issue of. cooking with Paula Deen"". (buzzer ringing) I got something ready somewhere. This is Honey Baklava Cups, and we are gonna use, instead of using all those sheets of phyllo dough, we are gonna use a little phyllo cups. So I'm real excited about sharing this recipe with y'all and you know, how you always make a syrup to pour over the baklava. Well, that's what we're gonna start with. I have got, I'm just going to read it off to you because like I said, if you don't have, this is a great gift. My magazine seems like it's for a year. It's like $19. Is that right Eddie? Do you know? I mean, it's so, and it's just like a dam full with all kinds of recipes. Well, you see there's. a little card in here, you know that anyway, it does make a great gift for people that like to cook. But in case you don't have a copy of December's magazine, I'm going to read this off to you. Now for the honey citrus syrup, y'all got opinion? (laughs) You're gonna need 3/4 a cup for water, and I've got that measured out right here. We're gonna need a half a cup of sugar. And it's measured out right here. Watch it. We are gonna need a 1/2. a orange thinly sliced. And I have that, and I'm going to need a. 1/2 of a lemon sliced, which I hadn't done that yet. But it would take about a second, This knife feels actually a little dull. It's cutting real dull too. I think one more slice and that'll get it. Then we'll turn that on, We gonna throw in a cinnamon stick. We gonna give that a stir. That looks good. Just like that. Alright, and now I'm gonna add a fourth of a cup of honey and that's what makes that baklava so stinking good. Now, once this becomes to a boil, I'm going to cover it and we're going to turn the temperature. down a little bit, and we're gonna simmer that, after it comes to boil. for about 20 minutes and we also have to kind of let it cool a little bit. So that's why I'm going ahead and making the syrup first and next we'll get started on the phyllo cups. So we let our sauce simmer for 20 minutes after it came to a boil. So I'm pulling it out of this hot pan. So hopefully that'll help it cool a little bit quicker. Now for the nutty part. I've got walnuts. I think I'll mix the walnuts and the slivered almonds together because I'm using the. small food processor. So I don't think I can get them all in. We want to grind this until it's almost pretty filled. (food processor sounds) 'Cause you know nuts are not really in big chunks in baklava. So let's take a look. I think that looks about right Eddie. How about you? - [Eddie] Mm-hmm. You think that's. - [Eddie] Yap. - You don't want it to be too big. Alright, I'm going to. get out another bowl. So we'll just do this and shifts I'm gonna throw in is my cup. I think it's a cup or is it a 1/2 a cup? No, it's one cup each. Not the almond slivers. So the almond slivers is a 1/2 of a cup. So a cup of walnuts, a couple of pecans and. half a cup of almonds. Now we're gonna add our cinnamon to this batch and our cloves and I think add sugar, don't we? Yeah. Until nuts are almost grounded. Yeah, I got it. So since we had to do this in two batches, I'll stir all that together real good. So everything will be coated. All right, let's see what that looks like. So I'm going to incorporate. all this together. And like I said, I'm going to have to. stir that up real good, because we want it all to be coated with the spices and the sugar. This looks and smells like. baklava already, Eddie. Now I have taken our phyllo cups and I have brushed them all with butter. And for that, you'll. just need a small brush. It'll fit inside your phyllo cups, just like that. So I've done every one of those along with Eddie's help. So we're going to fill my shell up and we go bake these for 20 minutes. And then after our syrup is cooled, we're going to pour our syrup over the nut mixture. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? This may be a messy little job, but I think I'll be better off doing it like this. So you see how much easier this is. I'm making the old timey Greek baklava. It's so delicious. We're going to have all those flavors that baklava has, we just not going to. quite that much trouble. I suspect if you're Greek descent, you probably know this baklava, like the back of your hand. I have to say I don't though. So I'll be back in a few minutes when I get all these filled and we're going to put them in a preheated 350 degree oven about 18-20 minutes. There you go. Now the beauty of these baklava cups, they all hold in a airtight container for five days. So this can be done five days in advance, 18 minutes in a 325 degrees oven. I think I might've said 350 earlier, but it's 325, so there you go. That's good. And it's still hot, but you can see what I did. I poured our syrup into a little colander and drained it. And now when the little cups come out of the oven, I'm just going to take a spoon and drizzle this end to each cup. Sounds good, right? (laughs) (dog barking) So 18 minutes in the oven, y'all the roast, the nuts. And now I'm putting about. a teaspoon of our syrup into each cup. And you just want to. kind of get it in there as even as you can. And it really does smell like baklava. So I hate to repeat myself too many times, but remember this is good for five days. So I like that because. there's a lot of desserts that won't hold, that long. And it is great to find wonderful, delicious recipes that you can make that far ahead of time. And they go and get better. I cheated and had more (laughs) and they're actually going to get better the longer they sit and that wonderful honey fruity syrup. I just hope I'm going to have enough. I find out now just to make more. I mean, this is so easy and so baklava. so I do hope y'all will try this recipe because it's more your time and little better of effort. So there you go. Love and best dishes and I hope it always. turns out sweet for you.";['postres']
_thLprgvqXU.json;[Music] [Music] okay welcome back y'all it's time for me to move on to a Michaels favorite part of the meal which is the sweets and you know when we go into Mexican restaurants it seems like that we fill up so on on all the food that we never want to dessert so I don't think of desserts as being a big part of Mexican menus but the next thing I'm gonna make is shoe rows they're much like a hot donut or a beignet now I've melted a half a stick of butter and I'm gonna pour in a cup of water and we're gonna bring this to a bowl I'm gonna add two teaspoons of sugar all right I ingredients have come to a ball now I've got this on high right now but I'm gonna turn it down to kind of a medium moderate heat and I'm just gonna dump in that all-purpose flour and I'm gonna add the zest of one orange and I'm gonna continue to cook this and mix it until it kind of comes away from the pan and forms a ball and you can see it's following the spoon around and I've got everything mixed up all the flour has disappeared so now I'm gonna transfer it to our Bowl and that's gonna help cool it off you can see how stiff fattiness all right now to help it cool down a little bit faster I'm gonna just give it a little mix with an electric mixer and like I said that's just gonna move that batter around and cool it off and after it cools off a second I've got four eggs and I'm gonna add those eggs one at the time to our batter so one at the time I'm going to drop in the eggs [Applause] so I can't beat none till I have a smooth batter force and now I'm going to move it over into our piping bag and this is barely warm now from all that beating and that orange zest smells so nice in there all right now we're gonna move down to the deep fryer now the recipe calls for a temperature of 350 degrees and we're going to come down here and we're gonna drop these into four inch pieces in the hot oil I think these are gonna be delicious I don't think we can go wrong with fried dough at all right now the first two are starting to brown a little bit for us so I'm making sure that I keep them turned so they don't Brown too too bad on one side all right we're gonna take these up and let them train for a second on a paper towel and since I forgot my nutmeg I'm just gonna come down here you know no harm no foul I'm just gonna add it in the last step all right now I've got plenty of nutmeg in it but put this in your batter because it'll be even more intense and I'm gonna take 1/2 a cup of sugar 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and that was probably 1/4 or teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg and I'm just gonna mix that all together real good and then we're gonna take a chi rose and we're gonna toss them in that sugar while they're still warm you know once you use fresh nutmeg you never want to go back to that ground nutmeg in the can mmm you can see how quick and simple and easy that was all right so don't these look wonderful and you can see why a cup of coffee or a glass of a mug of hot chocolate would just be wonderful to eat along with these mmm they're not too sweet the sweetest part is the sugar that we rolled them in but the actual cake is is like just right it's just strong with with the orange zest [Music] you;['postres']
_vnHkKMneTY.json;- Hey everybody, how y'all doing. It's Bobby here on Paula. Deen's Best Dishes. Thanks for tuning in. I've got for you today, a. really, really great snack, but it also can be a meal. This is gonna be my lunch today, and this is the kind of. stuff that I really like and eat all day every. day, and it's so simple. But what I like the most about it is that it's all real whole foods. The kind of stuff that we. really eat a lot of at my house is the kind of things that. would rot on the counter. You know what I mean? So I'm gonna make my. version of a banana split. So I'm just gonna take a ripe banana here and cut it right down. the middle, just in two. And I've got it in a. little ceramic boat here. Tip of it broke off. Tip broke, y'all But I'm gonna get it. Just kinda lay it open. Just got it in a little ceramic boat here. It looks nice. And we are going to top. this thing with some yogurt. So this is fat free. organic vanilla yogurt. So whatever your favorite. kind of yogurt is, use it. I like Greek yogurt. It's stuffed with probiotics. It's nice to put some Greek yogurt in here in my banana boat. There's a couple things that I'm missing that I wish I had. I would probably put some flax on this. I've got some granola topper. How would you do this if. you were in charge of it? You know, what order do you go in? I'm sure there's some people. watching that are like, you put the yogurt on the bottom, you put the yogurt in there first? Why not put some yogurt on the top? I might do both. You never know. You could add some peanut. butter to this if you wanted to, would be nice or maybe some almond butter. I'm gonna put a little bit of granola right here in the bottom. And if you don't want to use granola, you could use some fresh. nuts, some wall walnuts, or some pecans, or whatever you want. So a couple of strawberries. Who had banana splits when. they were kids or as adults? Me too. I love 'em. Love a banana split. Had more than my share of. 'em from the Dairy Queen I must admit, growing up. in ha Albany, Georgia, some banana splits. Some nice fresh raspberries,. some blueberries. And this is a snack, but man, you can make a meal out of this. I'm going to, I guarantee you. Some walnuts, some chopped. walnuts right on top, and maybe a little bit more yogurt. What would be good and I don't have any on me. would be some flax seeds maybe right on top of that. A bit of honey, more or less, depending on your taste. Voila. That is a great, delicious,. nutritious snack for you. It's my take on and a banana split.;['postres']
_WJvRV0VxSA.json;- Happy Halloween, y'all. I am fixing to share with y'all a recipe that takes me back to my grandmother Paul. Every Halloween, she would. make her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren, my two sons were her great grandsons, she would make these. popcorn balls for them, and they loved them. They couldn't wait to get out to her house to get that popcorn ball. So I'm gonna share that. recipe with y'all today, and I'm gonna start by adding sugar. Is the recipe gonna be. linked on this link? - [Producer] Yes, ma'am. - Or do I need to tell them measurements? - [Producer] It'll be on the link. - Okay, well, I'm gonna tell them anyway. Two cups of sugar, one. and a third cup of water, one teaspoon of white vinegar, and a half a teaspoon of salt. Let's see. Oh, we just have this. sitting on the salt. (laughs) - What does it say, a. half a teaspoon of salt? Which that should be. about a half a teaspoon. And we've got our vanilla extract, but we'll stir that in at the last minute. And we've got 18 cups of. popped corn, popcorn popped. So, we're gonna stir this all together. I've got to add my white Karo syrup. And we're gonna get this all mixed up and get it going over medium heat. And we're gonna cook it. until it reaches a hard boil, which is 255, 260, somewhere right in there. So we're just gonna get. this stirred up good, and then I'm gonna hook. our candy thermometer to the side of the pan. And we're just going to sit back and wait for it to get. to our magic number, 255 or 260. These things are so hard to read. (laughs) I think 260 will be easier to read. All right, in goes our vanilla. It took about 20 minutes, y'all. My grandma's not here for. me to call and ask her, but the recipe said cook. this over high heat, but I cooked it over medium high heat. And I mean, it was cooking. really, really good. So, I think somewhere between medium and medium high is good. So, we're gonna just now pour our syrup. We're not gonna let it cool. We're just gonna pour it. over all of our popcorn while it's hot. And we're gonna have to let. this cool for a few minutes, because if we tried to. form this into (laughs) popcorn balls, our hands would be bloody. There you go, okay. I'm trying to get every bit. of that syrup out. (laughs) I was just saying to the team here, I wonder how it would. do to put food coloring in the syrup and make. colored popcorn balls. Now I'm just going to kind. of stir it just a little bit, try to let that syrup go everywhere. And it's still hotter than. a three dollar pistol, I'm telling you. So, if you got children in. the kitchen on this recipe, please use caution, 'cause there's nothing. hotter than hot syrup. Okay, so I'm gonna let. that cool for a minute. I kinda got it coated. And when it cools down. enough for me to pick it up, I'm gonna start rubbing it into balls. It's feeling like styrofoam. (laughs) It's even making that. noise that styrofoam makes. I mean, a lot of that. syrup went straight down to the bottom of that pan. Okie doke, Teresa, I'm. probably gonna need your help. Now I'm doing one thing different that my grandma did not do. Teresa bought some of these cute little Halloween candies, but you know what? I might should have. added them to the syrup. - [Teresa] Oh, good idea. - You know, 'cause they don't wanna stick. And it kind of looks like bugs. (laughs) That's all right. It's Halloween. And we just.. You gonna come in here. and help me, Teresa? - Certainly. - Because we can't let this get too cool. I didn't spray my hands and. it's working out all right. Oh, I wish Jamie or Bobby was here to share their memories with me. You can make these balls. any size you want to. My balls are bigger than Teresa's. (both laugh) - [Teresa] Yeah, they're. not big enough to-- - You make little, petite sweet ones. And that's plenty big enough for a child. I'm used to doing for hungry boys. (both laugh) So that's it. Oh, grandmama Paul. - [Teresa] She'd be proud of us. - [Paula] She made these when. she really didn't have to. Didn't have any children living at home, but she was not gonna. let Halloween come and go without making these for her grandchildren and her great grandchildren. How you like it, Teresa? - [Teresa] My teeth are sticking together. - Look at Theresa eating it, Eddie. (all laugh) I'm telling you, I felt like my teeth had been. tied and screwed together. - [Teresa] But this takes me back, - I know. (laughs). - 'cause I always had these. - Look at that one. Now that one's got a good. bit of the candy in it. I think we'll have to work. on that concept a little bit. So, there you have it, kids. If mama has you in the kitchen or daddy has you in the. kitchen with this one, stand back when you're. working with that hot syrup, because we wouldn't want. any of you precious angels to get burned. So y'all have a safe and happy Halloween. And I'll be here waiting on. y'all when it's all over. (Paula laughs);['postres']

2Stkoa_8jwE.json;hey lovelies so as the weather outside continues to cool down things in the kitchen are just starting to heat up all month long i am sharing some of my very favorite comfort food classics and today it is all about this absolutely incredible broccoli cheddar soup that my whole family is loving right now especially elle who just can't seem to get enough now what i love about this soup is that it's quick and easy so it's perfect for a busy weeknight and it involves some extra veggies which we know we could all be getting a little more of now to get started for this soup i have got my nice big dutch oven heating up over medium-high heat on the stove and as soon as my dutch oven is nice and hot i'm going to go ahead and add some butter to it i just want to let that butter melt down until it becomes nice and frothy if you don't want to use butter in this recipe you also have the option to use a splash of oil instead it's totally up to you but of course the butter imparts a ton of great flavor now as soon as my butter is nice and melted i'm going to go ahead and add some onion to this the ingredients in this recipe are really really simple and there's very little prep involved basically you're really just chopping an onion some garlic and of course your broccoli florets if you wanted to do all of your chopping during your sunday meal prep you could save yourself a ton of time on a weeknight basically just get home throw it all into a pot and in under 30 minutes dinner is on the table and it's so super good and i'm just going to let that onion cook away for two to three minutes just until it starts to soften up and becomes translucent once our onion is nice and happy we can go ahead and get our garlic in here i'm using one clove in this recipe two or three will definitely work as well you guys know how we feel about garlic in this kitchen real good we always feel real good and just as soon as that glorious garlic smell hits your nostrils you know it's time to get some flour into the pan now we're using flour in this case just to thicken this up so it's going to make a nice rich creamy soup but we want to make sure that we're cooking off that more floury taste and that's why we add it to the pot before adding our liquids now we're just going to let our flour cook for another 30 seconds to a minute you want to make sure you're stirring it constantly because you don't want it to burn and the next step in this ultra simple recipe is just going to be adding more liquids in this case i am using a combination of some chicken broth as well as some milk now you could definitely use cream in this recipe if you want to that is totally an option i find this recipe is rich enough already with the cheese we're going to be adding but if you want to make it even more rich by all means go right ahead and add some cream instead now all we really want to do at this point is heat those liquids just until they reach a simmer you don't want to let them boil because you don't want to sculpt that milk as soon as you start to see some bubbles breaking the surface you basically want to turn your heat down to medium and then it's time to add our star ingredient or beautiful broccoli to the pot now you'll notice i'm using a combination of broccoli florets as well as the stalks i know a lot of people like to throw away their broccoli stalks but please don't they're really nutritious and super tasty just as tasty as the florets basically all you need to do is give them a quick peel with a vegetable peeler just because there's a bit of a woody peel that surrounds the stock but what's inside is totally edible and amazing once my broccoli is in the pot i like to add even more great flavor to this and to do that i am going to be adding some dried mustard as well as a little hint of smoked paprika now both of these ingredients are optional but i have to say they make the final flavor of this soup extra delicious we'll just give this all a quick stir and then we just want to let it simmer away for between five and ten minutes or until that broccoli is completely tender now as soon as that broccoli is tender we are ready to finish this soup off i like doing that with a good heaping helping of shredded cheddar cheese now you can see i am using some shredded yellow cheddar here you could use some white as well something really sharp is important though because you really want it to have great flavor speaking of flavor this is a great time to season this up with some salt and some pepper and honestly guys that's it we just want to stir this until that cheese is fully incorporated and then it is ready to be enjoyed seriously in 20 minutes or less what is not to love about that now of course you could always serve this yummy soup up with some nice fresh bread or even a grilled cheese on the side that would be super delicious but i like keeping things simple with just some apple slices that little bit of sweetness offsets the savoriness of the soup and it's really a match made in heaven guys i really hope you love this recipe as much as i do and that you'll give it a try for yourselves if you do be sure to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because you know how much i love seeing your kitchen creations remember this tasty recipe like all of our recipes is featured on

5T3KKRW9qmI.json;hi lovelies i am so glad you're here because today i am sharing my family's new favorite dinner recipe it is this absolutely incredible creamy tortellini soup it's quick it's easy it's super flavorful and also super filling plus it is totally child approved at least according to elle and it's become such a hit in our household that we're literally having it once a week at least to get started i have got a nice big pot heating up on the stove and i'm just going to add some oil to that and just as soon as that oil is nice and hot i'll go ahead and add some mild italian sausage to the pot now this is actually some mild italian turkey sausage something that i have been loving these days but if you wanted to use traditional pork sausage in this recipe you definitely could you could also opt for hot italian sausage instead or opt for just some ground chicken in this recipe it's really really versatile so whatever you prefer you can definitely use you also have the option to leave the meat out of this recipe entirely if you wanted to totally up to you and once my sausage is in the pan i'm just going to go ahead and use my spoon to break it up into little bits i want to cook it until it's no longer pink the good news is the sausage takes almost no time to cook as soon as your sausage is fully cooked through you can start to add the rest of your ingredients so first up i have got some onion headed in here as well as some nice thinly sliced carrot we're gonna let those cook up with the sausage for another say three or four minutes just until they start to soften and then i'm also going to be adding some minced garlic to this as well as a good helping of italian seasoning i'm using store-bought italian seasoning here but if you wanted to make your own i have a great recipe for homemade italian seasoning that i will link in the description box below it's really really easy to make and then you always have some on hand in your pantry and just as soon as that garlic and that italian seasoning becomes nice and fragrant which takes no time at all we're going to go ahead and add a few tablespoons of flour to this and the flour is just going to help things thicken up a little bit and give us a nice rich creamy texture in our soup i like to go ahead and let my flour cook for another 30 seconds to a minute just to sort of work off that floury taste pretty simple so far right trust me guys i am all about keeping things simple in the kitchen right now this one has been keeping me up all night and so uh the less effort i spend in the kitchen the happier i am next we're gonna go ahead and add our broth i'm using a nice chicken broth here we're just going to go ahead and add that to our pot and let it cook until our broth comes to a good boil so just as soon as you start to see those bubbles breaking the surface you can go ahead and add your tortellini to this so i'm using some fresh cheese tortellini you could use frozen tortellini in this recipe absolutely it would totally work here um what i love about it would totally work here what i what i love about using tortellini in a recipe like this is that it cooks in no time literally four or five minutes in this nice hot broth and it's going to be perfectly tender and ready to be enjoyed now that our pasta is fully cooked through there are only a few more steps before we get to enjoy this amazing soup first up we want to add some richness and some creaminess to this and i'm going to do that with some cream now you also have the option to use milk in this recipe but i find the cream really adds a ton of beautiful richness here so that's what i'm using at this point you'll want to season it up with a little salt and a little pepper to taste and the final step is just going to be stirring in some greens because of course we could all use more greens in our life today i'm using a heaping helping of baby spinach i'm just going to get it all into my pot and give it a good stir until it's totally wilted which only takes about a minute or so and at this point guys this yumminess is ready to be devoured and trust me devoured is exactly what it's going to be when your family gets to it come on guys tell me this wasn't one of the easiest soups i've ever made here on the channel but also one of the most delicious looking and smelling for that matter it smells incredible in here i really hope you guys will give this one a try for yourselves and if you do don't forget to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because you know how much i love seeing your kitchen

5tV2nfp8myI.json;hello lovelies in just a few weeks we will be welcoming the newest member of our family home and in preparation for this little one's arrival i am doing a lot of meal prepping so i'm prepping some of my favorite recipes to freeze them so that when the baby's born in the midst of all of that breastfeeding and diaper changing and baby snuggling i don't have to do any extra cooking now today it is all about this absolutely delicious italian wedding soup now if you're not familiar with italian wedding soup it's so tasty because it features meatballs and what is not to love about a soup that is loaded with yummy meatballs this recipe makes a nice huge batch so i'm going to enjoy some with the fam tonight but also freeze some for later now to get started i have got some ground beef and some ground chicken in my bowl traditionally in italian wedding soup you would use a combination of beef and pork i'm opting for chicken here to keep things a little lighter but you can swap in pork no problem i've also made this very same recipe using double chicken and that works really well too to make our meatballs i'm going to start by adding some breadcrumbs to this as well as one egg both of those ingredients are going to help bind our meatballs together and then i want to add some flavor so to start i've got some freshly grated parmesan cheese you guys know how i feel about freshly grated parmesan in my opinion it is the only way to go i also have some freshly chopped parsley so about a quarter of a cup i've got some italian seasoning here and then finally for some really nice garlicky flavor i'm going to be grating in a clove or two of garlic i like grating the garlic so that you don't end up with big chunks of garlic in any of your meatballs but however you want to do it is totally up to you i'll season this up liberally with some salt and some pepper and then i just want to get this really well combined you can either do it with a fork or with your hands like i often end up doing because my hands just seem to be the right tool for the job to get everything really well mixed you don't want to overwork your meat because you don't want to make your meatballs too tough you want them to be nice and tender so just get that combined then we can go ahead and form our meatballs i've got a parchment lined baking sheet here that i'm going to be placing my meatballs on as i form them we are going to be making a lot of meatballs so if you have some extra hands that could help out in the kitchen that will make this job go a little bit faster i like to use a cookie scoop for this job just because it keeps the meatballs pretty uniform and then i just roll my meatballs between my hands until they form the perfect little shape and then i'll arrange all of my completed meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet i'll be honest when i turned the camera off i sat down to do this because let's be serious that eight months pregnant too much standing is not good for anyone um but my meatballs are all formed and now we are ready to get cooking so there are actually a number of different ways to cook your meatballs in an italian wedding soup some people like to pop them into the oven right on the baking tray and they'll cook them completely before adding them to the soup other people will just leave the meatballs raw and add them straight into the hot broth and let them cook in the soup itself the third way is the way i really like to do it it's to sear them in a little bit of oil in the same pot you're going to be cooking your soup and while this process is a little more time-consuming in my opinion it develops the best color and the best flavor so that's why i think it is totally worth the effort but honestly guys whatever you want to do is up to you now to get started i have got my nice big dutch oven heating up on the stove and i'm just going to go ahead and get my meatballs into my pan in a single layer so we're going to be doing this in batches you don't want to rush these because you want to make sure that they get golden on all sides and you have to do that in a single layer it's important to be gentle with your meatballs here because you do not want to squish them once you've got your first batch of meatballs in the pot you want to let it cook up for maybe one to two minutes just until it starts to get a slightly brown color then you can use your tongs to give them a little nudge sort of roll them around a little bit to get them browned on the opposite side and then another nudge to get them brown on another side and what you end up with are these nice golden meatballs and we'll just remove those meatballs from the pan and get started on our next batch keep in mind these are not fully cooked through yet they're going to finish cooking in the hot broth of the soup so not to worry we just wanted to get that nice color happening and then we'll get them back in here to finish up cooking once you've got all of those meatballs browned you can set them aside and we'll get to work on making our delicious soup now to get started once again i'm going to heat up a little bit of oil in my pot and as soon as that oil is nice and hot i'm going to add some onion some celery and some carrots to the pot a really classic soup combination i'll let those cook up stirring them frequently for between three and five minutes just until the veggies start to soften up and you see that celery turn nice and bright green and then i'm going to go ahead and add some garlic into the pot i of course love garlic pretty much in everything and an italian soup definitely needs to have some garlic in it and just as soon as that garlic is fragrant after about 30 seconds i'll go ahead and add my broth to the pot so i am using eight cups of good quality chicken broth and i'm going to get that right into my pot and we're just going to let that broth come to a nice rolling boil and in the meantime i want to impart even more grape flavor into this soup and i'm going to do that using a parmesan rind now this is basically what's left over once you're done grating all of the parmesan cheese you just have this rind i like to save mine in a zipper bag in the refrigerator and whenever i'm making a nice savory soup like this i pop one of the rinds into the broth and as that broth cooks up the rind will impart this absolutely amazing savory flavor into my stock that is super super super super delicious it is soup after all if you don't have a parmesan rind like this on hand though not to worry you could also just add some freshly grated parmesan at the end of cooking as well to get that same amazing flavor i just like the parmesan rind because of course it creates no waste and we are all about less waste in the kitchen just as soon as you have that nice rolling boil happening you know it's time to add your pasta now traditionally in italian wedding soup they use something called a chine de pepe i'm using something just slightly bigger you want to use just a really really small pasta sometimes i'll use stars for elle because she loves them but i didn't have any on hand and i'm just going to get in here with my pasta and then i also want to go ahead and add my meatballs to this now i'm probably going to add half of my meatballs and save the other half for another batch or maybe i'll just add them all so we're going to let this bubble and boil away for another 10 to 15 minutes we want to make sure our meatballs are cooked fully through and that our pasta is nice and cooked and then we will add our finishing ingredients and then friends we can get eating because let's be honest we're starving after 10 minutes your meatballs are going to be fully cooked through and that pasta is going to be nice and tender and then we can add our finishing touches now this next step is optional but i absolutely love it because i think it adds a ton of richness to this dish we're basically going to be adding some egg into our soup now if you've never added egg to soup before i know it sounds a little strange but i will tell you it adds a ton of this beautiful richness to your soup broth that i think you're really going to enjoy so consider it i am basically just going to start by whisking up a couple of eggs and then we're going to do something called tempering so to do that i'm just going to use a measuring cup and i'm going to go in here and get myself a nice bit of soup and what you want to make sure you're doing while you're tempering is you're going to add your broth really slowly to your egg and you want to keep it whisking because otherwise you will end up scrambling and that is not what we are going for this is going to help the temperature of the eggs rise without scrambling them so that when we add them back into the pot of soup we don't end up with a big curdled mess once you've got your eggs nicely tempered you can add them into your pot and you'll see almost instantly the texture of your broth changes to become really rich and a little bit thick and super super tasty the final step here is just to add some glorious greens to this now escarole is very common in an italian wedding soup but i had spinach on hand so that's what i'm using today i just gave some baby spinach a nice quick chop and i'm going to get it into the pot and just as soon as that spinach is nicely wilted this yummy soup is ready to be enjoyed oh my gosh guys there is so much to love about it it smells amazing it looks amazing it tastes amazing you can eat it fresh and hot from the stove or you can freeze it like i'm going to do totally up to you both ways are absolutely delicious i really hope you guys will give this recipe a try for yourselves and if you do be sure to

77b4Tc0MPeE.json;Today I am super excited to be participating. in KIN Community's New Year, New You Collaboration! Now for this collaboration dozens of YouTubers. have gotten together to post a new video every day through January with tips and tricks for. making 2015 your best year yet. For my part in this collaboration I'm sharing one of my. very favorite recipes that is perfect for #MeatlessMonday. Now this year I am really. concentrating on trying to eat less meat, and participating in #MeatlessMonday is a. great way to do that. It's good for the environment, it's good for your wallet and it's certainly. great for your health. Today I'm going to share with you my recipe for my delicious. black bean soup, and the coolest part is it all cooks up in your slow cooker so it's super. simple, you can just set it and forget it. For this beautiful soup I'm going to get started. with some red onion some celery and some diced red bell pepper. Now you have two options. here you can either dump these veggies straight into your slow cooker, that will totally work,. or if you want to get a deeper flavor you can saute them first on the stove, that's. what I'm going to do today. So I've just got some oil heating up in a frying pan and to. that I'm going to add my veggies. To this I'm going to be adding some minced garlic. and some minced jalapeno. Now if you don't like the heat you could totally leave the. jalapeno out but I totally enjoy the heat so I'm going to go for it. We're going to. saute these for another 30 seconds and then we are going to add our spices. Now I love. to toast my spices before they go into the slow cooker because the flavor gets a lot. deeper and richer. So I am toasting up some cumin some chili powder and a little bit of. oregano. I'm going to heat these spices up for another 30 seconds and then I'm just going. to deglaze the pan using some vegetable stock. I'm going to pour with whole mixture into. my slow cooker and then I'm going to build the rest of my black bean soup. For this recipe. I'm using canned black beans, you could totally use dried black beans as well but you'll want. to remember to soak them overnight to make sure they soften up enough. If you are using. canned black beans you can just dump the entire can straight into the slow cooker, you don't. have to worry about rinsing or draining them. So I'm adding my black beans to my slow cooker. and to that I'm going to add some salsa. Now you could totally use just plain diced tomatoes. that will work just as well but I find that adding salsa adds even more delicious flavor. to the final soup. Super Good! And then the last step is topping up your slow cooker with. more vegetable broth. How amazing does this look, and I can tell you the house smells. incredible already. All I'm going to do is give this a really good stir, put on the lid. and then set my slow cooker for 6-8 hours. Of course the longer this simmers the more. delicious it's going to be. Once your soup is ready you can use an immersion blender. to puree it. Now if you don't have an immersion blender like this don't sweat it at all you. could totally use a traditional blender as well but I will tell you, you need to be very. very cautious when you are blending hot liquids. So, watch this video for full directions on. the safe way to blend hot soup. You just want to make sure that this is in the soup before. you start blending otherwise you can make quite a big mess. Now I like to only puree. it half way so it's got that smooth rich texture but it also still has some chunks of black. beans. That's the best way as far as I'm concerned! Now that our soup is pureed we're just going. to add one more delicious element. We're going to squeeze the juice of two limes into our. soup. This is going to give it a really refreshing tangy flavor. I promise you that you do not. want to skip this step. We're going to give this a good stir and then it's time to serve. our soup. I like topping mine with a little bit of sour cream, some fresh avocado slices. and some fresh cilantro. How amazing does this look. Totally effortless to put together. and the final result could not be more delicious. I hope you'll give this tasty recipe a try. and if you do be sure to tweet or instagram me a photo because you know I love seeing. what you're coming up with in your very own kitchens. And of course be sure to check out. all of the other awesome videos in this New Year, New You collaboration, you will not. regret i!;['primeros']

a24oNnr1GW0.json;hey lovelies so our soup series continues today with three delicious low-carb soup recipe is that you really have to taste to believe you guys have been asking for more and more low carb recipes on the channel and of course I always love to deliver so today we're starting with this amazing loaded cauliflower soup now if you're not familiar with the term loaded the idea is it tastes a lot like a loaded baked potato so there's bacon there's sour cream there's cheese there's chives you know it can't be bad so if made soup similar to this using potato but since we're going low-carb today I thought it would be awesome to do the same soup but using some cauliflower instead I'm gonna start by cooking up a little bit of bacon I'll cook that bacon up just until it starts to crisp then it's time to add my onion straight into the pot if you wanted to remove a little bit of the bacon fat at this point you definitely could but I'm leaving it all in there because it's going to impart a ton of great flavor into this soup once my onions in the pan it'll only take two or three minutes to soften up then I'll add some garlic to this as well after the garlic has had about 30 seconds to get really flavorful we'll go ahead and add our cauliflower to the pot so for this recipe I'm using a whole head of cauliflower I just chopped it up into florets and I'm gonna get it into the pot with some chicken broth I always like using a really good-quality chicken broth in my soup recipes I find it makes all the difference in the final flavor I'm also going to be adding a helping of cream to this now you could use milk here instead but I find the cream makes for a really really rich soup and then I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil as soon as it reaches a boil I'll reduce my heat to sort of medium-low pop the lid on and let the simmer away until that cauliflower is completely tender usually that takes between say 10 and 15 minutes so I'm gonna turn my heat off completely and the reason I'm going to do that is because I'm actually going to be pure aying this and blending it until it's completely smooth using my immersion blender if you don't have one of these at home I highly recommend buying one they are totally worth their weight in gold they can vary in price a little bit I will link a few in the description box below so you can take a look for yourself because they are so handy especially when it comes to soups right on the stove just like this now when you're using an immersion blender you really want to make sure that the immersion blender stays completely submerged in the soup so that you don't get any dangerous splashes that could burn someone as soon as your soup is nice and smooth you can go ahead and add your finishing ingredients in this case because we are going for that loaded baked potato flavor I have got some sour cream headed in here but I want to make sure to temper my sour cream before adding it back into my pot if you're not familiar with the concept of tempering we're basically going to add a little bit of the hot liquid into the cool sour cream to heat it up before we add it into our soup pot the reason we do that is because adding cold sour cream to our hot soup can cause it to separate and that is not what we're looking for we want a really smooth texture at this point I'm also going to stir in some shredded cheddar cheese for even more great flavor and I've got some finely chopped chives headed in here as well we'll mix that all together and as soon as it's well combined this soup is ready to be enjoy I like serving it up tops with some more cheddar cheese a little bit of bacon and some chives and oh my gosh guys you will absolutely love this soup it's so flavorful you will not even miss the potato I swear next for something equally flavorful and equally low-carb I have got this amazing rustic chicken soup very rarely our low carb recipes this comforting guys I think you're gonna love this one so it all starts once again with my soup pot on the stove I've got a little oil heating up and once my oil is nice and hot I'm going to get to work on cooking up my chicken so here I'm using some boneless skinless chicken breast that's just been cut into cubes you could use thighs here instead those will be really flavorful as well we're just gonna give our chicken a little bit of a head start so I'll season it up with some salt and pepper and cook it just until it's browned then I'm gonna go ahead and add some onion and some celery to my pot the combination of onion and celery in a soup just so perfect and we're just gonna cook that until the onion starts to soften up you'll see your celery start to turn bright green and then I'm gonna go ahead and add some garlic in as well next I've got some diced tomatoes headed into my pot as well as some chicken broth for flavor in this recipe we are going to be using a whole lot of lovely herbs so I've got some rosemary that I finely chopped a little bit of fresh oregano as well as some fresh thyme headed into the pot if you wanted to use dried herbs in this recipe instead of fresh you definitely could but you'd want to cut those measurements in half because dried herbs are a lot more potent than their fresh counterparts I'm also going to be adding a bay leaf to this and then finally the real secret ingredient here is this now this is a parmesan rind so basically when you buy a block of Parmesan cheese and you grade it grate it crate it all you're left with at the end is the rind and what I do is I set these aside in a bag in my refrigerator and when it comes time to make a really delicious soup like this I just pop the entire Ryan straight into the pot and as the soup cooks what it does is infuse the soup with this amazing savory sort of cheesy flavor and then when it's finished cooking all you do is remove the parmesan rind and what's left behind is a ton of great flavor I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil once it's reached a boil we can reduce our heat to medium pop a lid on it and let this cook up for 10 to 15 minutes and then it's just a matter of adding our finishing ingredients but I've got a good helping of kale headed into this Zoop this is a great place to sneak in your greens if you don't want to use kale spinach would work here too and I'm also going to add a little freshly grated Parmesan for good measure and oh my gosh guys this soup is just so packed with tasty flavor your taste buds are going to be celebrating all dinner long speaking of flavor which clearly seems to be the theme in today's video our final recipe is absolutely packed with it it's my curried cauliflower soup and oh my gosh guys you won't believe how tasty it is now this one all starts with a little coconut oil heating up in my soup pot well my coconut oil is anthalie melted I'm gonna go ahead and add some onion and a little bit of carrot to this now I know technically carrots are not the lowest carb ingredient but they're not super high carb either and I think they add a nice body to this if you wanted to skip the carrots in this recipe definitely go right ahead it's up to you I like that they add a little bit of color and add a little extra nutrition to this dish next I'm going to add a little garlic and some ginger to this at this point I'm also going to be adding my superstar ingredient some curry powder and then I'm gonna smash a bunch of glass on the counter it's always good to allow your curry powder to have a quick head start on the heat it warms up all of its spices and makes it even more flavorful then we are going to get our cauliflower into the pot as well as our broth and our coconut milk to keep this recipe completely vegan I'm using vegetable broth here and I'm also using both fat coconut milk here which I find has the best texture I'll hit this up with little salt and a little pepper and then I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil once it's reached to boil it we can reduce our heat to medium pop a lid on it and let this cook up for 10 to 15 minutes just until that cauliflower is completely tender at this point it's time to turn my heat off completely give it a puree with our immersion blender and it is ready to be served up this could not be more perfect we have such a beautiful texture here my last step with this nice velvety soup is just going to be stirring in freshly chopped cilantro and it's as simple as that this is a low carb vegan soup that you can feel really good about and it makes excellent leftovers for lunch

a9lZ765L_P0.json;hi lovelies we are celebrating the arrival of soup season with some of my all-time favorite soup recipes and when it comes to comfort food today's recipe is the very best it's my absolutely amazing creamy chicken and vegetable soup and it's full of good for you ingredients that your entire family will love now i don't know about you guys but in my house cold season has arrived with a vengeance my kids have been sick basically constantly since september so this soup has been on heavy rotation because it's really really comforting if you're not feeling well the best part is it's actually really really easy to make and you can do all of your prep during your sunday meal prep so come monday or tuesday night you can just throw it all in a pot and it's ready in less than 30 minutes what is not to love now of course this soup like most of my soups all starts with a nice big soup pot heating up on the stove if you don't have a nice big soup pot like this i highly recommend asking santa for one it's one of those kitchen tools i simply could not be without you should also keep in mind that while you can get these very expensive versions there's also much more affordable ones for example this one i think was less than fifty dollars i'll link a couple options in the description box below if you're interested in picking one up yourself so to my pot i'm gonna start by adding some butter so i've got this heating up over medium-high heat and i'm just going to let that butter melt down you don't want to use butter in this recipe it's totally fine a little olive oil or some vegetable or canola oil will totally work here but you guys know how i feel about butter right butter makes everything better come on especially when you're not feeling well you got to have the butter just as soon as that butter is melted i'm going to get in here with some onion some celery and some carrots all classic soup ingredients and i just want to let those cook away for maybe three or four minutes just until they start to soften up and you'll notice that celery turns nice and bright green in addition to all the sickness we've been battling in my house my sweet baby cold just turned eight months old and he's cutting all four of his top front teeth right now so there's been a lot going on we're a little sleep deprived and i like to think that this soup is extra comforting for him too oh yes he loves this soup as well all right just as soon as your veggies are nice and soft like mine are here we're gonna go ahead and add some garlic to this and with my garlic guys i am not holding back i've got two big cloves headed in here when you're talking about cold fighting soups you definitely want to add as much garlic as you can tolerate also it smells amazing in the pot we're just gonna let that garlic get nice and hot and bothered for another 30 seconds or so before we go ahead and add some flour to this i'm using flour in this recipe to give me a nice rich and creamy texture but what i want to do first is sort of cook off that floury flavor so i'm just going to let my flour cook up stirring it constantly for another minute or so then i'm gonna go ahead and add some potatoes to my pot adding potatoes to this soup makes it a lot more filling and hearty you know sometimes you have a bowl of soup and then you're hungry just an hour or two later the potatoes really help to sort of fill you up same thing with the chicken and the extra veggies that go in here so i've got two large potatoes cut into a nice small dice and i'm also going to be adding my broth at this point so i like using low-sodium chicken broth in this recipe but it's really up to you whatever kind of broth you like you could also do this with vegetable broth if you wanted to totally up to you depending on what you have on hand i'm also gonna go ahead and add my chicken to the pot so i'm using some boneless skinless chicken thighs here and i'm actually going to be adding them whole and then what i'll do is let them cook completely take them out and chop them if you wanted to do this with chicken breasts you totally could or if you had leftover cooked chicken you absolutely have the option to add that in here as well when it comes to seasoning this soup you really have the option to use any sort of dried herbs you want here but i like keeping things simple and classic with just a nice sprig of fresh thyme i find you get really really gorgeous flavor that way and at this point i'm just gonna pop a lid on my pot and bring this mixture to a boil just as soon as it's reached a boil you can reduce your heat to medium and let this cook away for maybe 10 or 15 minutes that's really all it takes for those potatoes to get nice and tender and that chicken to be fully cooked through all right friends it's been about 15 minutes and you can see lots of yummy things are happening here our chicken is fully cooked and so are those potatoes so now it's time to get our chicken out of the pot and we're gonna give it a rough chop before we get it back into the pot this is a really really quick technique that i use with pretty much all my chicken soup recipes now at the same time i'll remove my time spray as well we're going to pop the lid on this and let it keep cooking while we set to work on just chopping up this chicken quickly honestly it's so easy to do at this point because the chicken is nicely cooked all right now we're going to bring it all together so i've got my chicken all chopped up and it's going to go straight back into my pot watch for any splashback i really like to add lots of chicken to make this extra filling i'm also ready to add even more great veggies to this soup because i want it to be as nutritious as possible so i've opted for some broccoli florets that i've just cut into nice small pieces as well as some peas i'm using fresh but you could definitely use frozen in this recipe now the cool part about this is you can actually add any kind of greens you want here you could add some kale some spinach a little bit of asparagus or some green beans or even some snap peas or snow peas if you have those on hand i like adding them towards the end of cooking so they keep their nice bright green color and they don't get too mushy basically i'm just gonna let these cook for another two to three minutes just until my broccoli is tender and at this point i'm ready to finish this soup off i like to do it with a good splash of cream for added richness and a nice helping of salt and pepper to taste and honestly guys that's it how easy was that this soup is rich creamy satisfying and super nutritious which is why i absolutely adore it i hope your family loves it as much as mine does and that you'll give it a try for yourselves if you do be sure to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because you know how much i love seeing your kitchen creations remember this recipe like all of my recipes is featured

AJBOLAwan0I.json;hello friends and welcome back to my channel so today is going to be a really fun video monkey's actually having all of his best guy friends over and they are doing their fantasy football drafts so i know he's very excited and we are going to grill out smash burgers later but while they do their draft i thought it'd be fun to make some little snacks for them so i'm going to share three very simple very easy few ingredient appetizer recipes with y'all [Music] what is this what [Music] who's going to be your number one draft pick um monkey by the time they see this you've already done it no i'm saying you should know oh it depends on what draft slot i get if i have the first pick it's going to be a certain person if i have the 10th pick it's going to be a different person who do you want first that's impossible to answer it depends on what draft position oh my goodness gracious these are trick these are loaded questions okay they say y'all tell us down below in the comments if your husband gets as excited as mr b does about his fancy football team it's draft day baby okay so for this first recipe all you're gonna need is three ingredients and i think these are gonna be so good so they're gonna be little everything but the bagel kielbasa bites so you're gonna need one package of kielbasa you're gonna need some crescent rolls and then of course some everything but the bagel seasoning i'm going to go ahead and roll this out and then we will get our kielbasa wrapped up in it [Music] okay so we're just gonna have this i'm gonna take my first one which would be like um four individual little crescents and i'm just gonna kind of like spread it out and pinch these seams together okay so place one part of your little kielbasa on there and just wrap this up and now we're just going to sprinkle our everything with the bagel seasoning on here so you want to coat all sides but this stuff is very powerful so don't use too much oh no you can overdo it you can always knock that stuff off of there you know if you got too much yeah kind of press it in there so it gets like down in the dough sorry sometimes i just get so excited to watch what's actually happening that you forget you're filming is that good you think yeah that's that's that's pretty good coverage there okay okay so now you're gonna take this and you're just gonna cut like little bites you want them to be about an inch thick [Music] so this is kind of like pigs in a blanket but more grown-up style [Music] that looks like a lot of pig to blanket [Music] okay now i gotta do our other kabasa and then you're gonna take the rest of your crescent roll which should be the exact same amount roll it out and do the exact same process [Music] quite the delight yes this is almost something i would really maybe even want to just eat for breakfast right yeah actually there's lots of ways you can make this or like different seasonings but the area of the bagel is gonna be so good okay so now these are going into the oven at 350 for like nine to 12 minutes and that is it these are the most simple little bites ever and also i was going to say the key to this is once they come out you want to let them like cool completely so give them about 10 minutes and that way the bread like adheres to that sausage really well it doesn't come like unraveled okay so this next recipe is my favorite and i've made this one other time it was quite a while ago and i'm not kidding when i tell y'all i think about this recipe all the time and i have not made it ever since so i cannot wait for this i'm going to like crash whole fancy football party so i can have some of this and this one is only four ingredients and also only going to take about 10 minutes so simple you know when you uh made this last it was for football something no no it was new year's eve oh yes new year's eve okay but not this year was the year before so we are doing our little like biscuit gorgonzola pull apart bread oh my gosh so good so you'll need some gorgonzola cheese you can also use blue cheese if you want to the gorgonzola is just a little bit milder so you'll need one container of that you're also going to need some garlic and then about half a stick of butter i'm going to go ahead and melt this and then we're going to add some garlic to it and we're going to cut up our biscuits into like little cubes and roll these around in the garlic butter i was going to say i'm really excited about those kielbasa things you really are i'm so glad i know this is good but like that i'm really excited for [Music] okay so to my melted butter i'm gonna add in a good amount of garlic you can kind of add in however much you want and then we are going to let's do a little bit more old juice and then we're just going to pour this all over top of these um biscuits and kind of toss them that way they're just like really evenly coated yeah i want i want butter all over them biscuits butter on the biscuits i feel like it helps them pull apart better too i think so too so give these a good toss [Music] my goodness it's gonna be so good i think there's so many recipes that you can make with biscuit though just from a can we can okay now to this we're just going to top it with our gorgonzola cheese look it's kitty so next we're just going to pop these into the oven at 375 and they take about 20 to 30 minutes so just keep an eye out until they are nice and golden brown these just came out and they look so good so i'm going to let them rest for about 10 minutes [Music] oh my god they're really so good this is amazing oh yeah it's so easy i guess you probably have to have a preference for everything bagel seasoning but if you do it's really good good does this not look amazing it is one of my all-time favorite appetizers y'all have to try this one okay so before we get started on this third recipe i want to take a second and thank cara for sponsoring today's video

wanted them to be able to have their time so i went out got my nails done what else did i do stopped in the target you know all the usual things and we are leaving this morning for tennessee so my straightener and my curling iron is already packed so ignore my poofy hair but we decided we still wanted to make these little pizza bombs that i'm about to make because we don't really want to have to stop on our way to tennessee so we thought these would actually be perfect for our little road trip they're like handheld bunking can eat them while he's driving the camper so bunkie used to have these whenever he was a little kid this is bunky's um i don't see his recipe but he requested this yeah now the only thing is i really don't quite we both don't quite know what kind of bread his mom used yeah we called her and she said parker style rolls so we have the sister schubert parker house style rolls we have let them thaw they were frozen i have crescent rolls on backup just in case these go south oh no but all you're gonna need is some yeast rolls some mozzarella and some pepperoni so again only three ingredients so simple and they shouldn't take long at all all right sister let's see what you got love that we just are not sure this is the right thing oh i feel like we were these are supposed to be more like a uh like a yeast roll like salt this this can't be right yeah but look you can kind of smush it down no i don't think so bae okay y'all these are still very tasty maybe we should just cook these i'm getting the crescent rolls out get the crescent rolls out babe sister schubert we still love you okay so now we're just gonna put our little pepperonis and mozzarella cheese in our crescent roll i'm gonna dust them lightly with a little bit of melted butter parmesan and some italian seasoning on top oh honey you have you know what i realized though that we won't have i guess we could kind of heat it up a little side of marinara to dip them in yeah if we just put it in a container yeah container now set it on the dashboard that sun will just you know that little that little spot the little tray on the dash yeah that thing is like a i mean you don't ever i'm sure people know this but you put anything that's metal up in that thing and then grab it it's hot you already got a little oven yeah [Music] we like always had a little bag of pepperonis in our refrigerator bee's been telling me these little uh pizza bites or pizza bombs whatever you want to call them are like gonna take him back to his child they already have the memories they're flooding back [Music] okay monkey wants four pepperonis per roll so i'm just kind of like staggering them yeah they can the pepperoni i feel like can kind of be out the edge a little bit yeah the cheese though we want to stay in there because yes we don't want that leaking out on us [Music] sister schubert donkey listen here buddy now how am i gonna roll this up with this stretch i got you we'll just let's get all the cheese a little more centralized here and then we're gonna tuck look at this technique where did i roll up that one i was rolling up the uh enchiladas oh yeah yeah yeah loosely we want a loose roll there we are okay look at that little guy huh well you know what you just earned yourself a job i did not i'ma let you finish [Music] funky what is this what is this what what is this oh my goodness are they taking your thing are they taking spaghetti pie from you are they trying they try this is an insult [Music] i like to be very gentle with the crescent rolls you know because i like them to get i like the fluffy puffiness i feel like if you press and smush them too much they get uh they don't rise and get as you know airy and flaky as one would like right okay popping these into the oven at 350 for like 12 to 14 minutes i almost forgot our parmesan and italian seasoning so i'm just gonna actually spray the tops of these lightly with some parquet [Music] okay these look so good they were in there for probably about 14 to 15 minutes but they are going to be delicious i know somebody that is very excited about them that looks real yummy you touch them i you know i think they might need to go back in there for a few more minutes because i like mine overcooked i like them nice and brown okay monkey likes his overcooked so i'm gonna actually stick these back in here for just like two more minutes but if you like yours soft and fluffy just do it for like the 14 to 15. all right y'all so that's gonna do it for this video i hope you enjoyed making these little appetizers with me if you try any of them let me know what you think also don't forget to check out care of down below in my description box i love you guys so much be sure to subscribe if

great football food I know the Super Bowl coming up a lot of you are probably going to either be hosting your own parties or you're going to be going somewhere where you have to make an appetizer so we thought we would bring you some really good food today so why we make a monkey bowls meat sauce Stephanie bowls with no stuff with mozzarella yeah I'm so excited about those and fun fact I've never even had meatballs so this will be a first for me and then we're making some sausage cheese dip yes that's these favorite buffalo chicken rained and crack-tip I'm so excited I cannot wait to eat all this food so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that we are going to make our our mozzarella stuffed meatballs these take not very long to prepare but they take the longest to cook so you are going to prepare these and then cook them in your crock pot for about two hours but that is perfect because you can easily just transport this to your party or present your house it's like easy cleanup so anyways we're gonna go ahead get startled those and then also punky is going to start grilling our chicken for our buffalo chicken ring so we have that out as well and basically as I go through each recipe I'll kind of show you what all it involves or what the ingredients are for this one I just have some hamburger meat some Italian sausage bread crumbs Parmesan cheese this is some parsley we have some mozzarella and we just got the little pearl so they're already in like little balls so we can just easily stuff them and then of course a jar of red sauce oh and two eggs so anyways those are the ingredients for our meatballs so we're gonna go ahead and get started funky actually found this recipe on tasty and it looks incredible you're both so excited and Bucky loves meatballs but I've never had them so I'm super pumped we're gonna change your life today because y'all know I've just heard any red sauce very recently only in the past like six months so I'm excited I think they're gonna be so yummy I mean how much know does it call for gonna be good let's try okay don't tell the people that it's better milk until after the fact okay okay we need all the minutes are you gonna mix this together babe what's that all the meat and stuff oh wait no yeah okay I'm just getting up some measuring cups so in this bowl we just have a pound of ground beef and then bumpy went ahead and added a pound of Italian sausage as well and he's just gonna go ahead and start combining those [Music] doesn't you don't I'll crack in an egg okay so into this mixture we're gonna put two eggs so punky just practically where's egg number two okay now what she might help doing I need some parmesan and you can give me that wonderful parsley that you just chopped we just get one more little broth cup that looks good okay you that's me telling you that this is is that yeah well it's about half a cup yeah beep site that's close all right how much hard one it says 1/4 cup that's it do that know it so that one of them together I mean they're passing more cards out of this I'm telling you or I'll put Oh gracious here we go there's no way dude this much cheese we're putting cheese with it oh I forgot that still don't you like you [Music] oh right [Music] okay what next a cup of breadcrumbs okay yeah and then barley powder one teaspoon of garlic powder okay one taste business or trying oregano please salt and pepper lunch just like the teeth it says half a teaspoon of each I think last ingredient is half a cup of milk [Music] and then you just gonna mix it all together according to urban legend you don't want to overwork the meat you don't want worker maybe all the breadcrumbs are down at the bottom there's muscles to work okay we're starting simply one book he is well he has formed his first meatball now I'm gonna start handing him the cheese to put inside of it [Music] not too much let's try it we're gonna do like three three little pearls yeah let's take three three pearls it's like together though it's hard to get just three what if I eat half of this while we do it mmm you could just throw a piece in my mouth we catch it I could try one [Music] good lucky I am so impressed I had um Duomo hadn't forced some of the sauce in there yes okay so we're gonna go ahead and get the crock pot warming up so they're cooking on high for two to two and a half hours so I'll go ahead and just get it warm and then Bucky show us how you added your cheese to here [Music] I assume these are gonna cook down a little bit too you know mm-hmm and just gently roll her up do the labor count [Music] okay so I'm gonna go ahead and put just a little bit of our salt into the crock pot so the gist of it is there will be a layer of sauce the only are your meatballs add some more sauce add more meatballs and they'll cook in here for two hours like ratina right yeah just I think you just don't want to make direct contact on the you know [Music] over here snacking while bunkies doing all the hard work give me some cheese okay bunky did just tell me that um these are supposed to have a fourth of a cup like a third of an onion all third of an onion chopped up in here but obviously we did not put that in there because sorry babe that's okay these are humongous I can't really make me smaller though they're gonna go on there's some of me later like on top of that too if there's not just one layer of Meatballs all right last one now we're just gonna cover them with some more sauce [Music] suppose you cover all the meatballs [Music] little puffle it took two hours and then wash your hands all right so all the meatballs are cooking we're gonna go ahead and start on our second recipe which is the salsas cheese dip and this is literally mr. B's favorite thing ever it is so yummy and he feels like he has a secret ingredient some of you probably do this and use it as well but for him it says he can create and he's gonna share it with you guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start browning up the sausage meat by the way I always think grounding gut but is it browning um browning Ronnie yes surprise everyone like a hundred times out here anyways oh yeah it's not hamburger meat it's ground beef whatever be I'm gonna go ahead and start browning the sausage and we have oh we have our teeny-tiny little crock pot which we probably showed you guys before but this thing is like perfect for little parties it's like a great size if you don't want to look around this bad boy so anyway so we're gonna use this yeah it's great there's my favorite thing we're gonna use that to make our cheese dip jeez dude do me except circle your sausage yeah okay hang on you don't show the ingredients oh okay so for this recipe we have some sausage I get the hot one just because you guys know we'd like it spicy around here we have some Velveeta hopefully this is enough I thought we had a little bit more than that but it'll do and then I can't of Rotel if oh here you can share your secret ingredient cream cheese use the whole block or half a bottle blog all right so that's mr. B's secret ingredient you guys want us know in the comments if you use Franklin summers - probably not that's okay all right let's go ahead and start cooking this [Music] am i doing bunkie cutting cheese cutting the cheese I do like to keep it up a little bit though cuz I just feel like it helps him melt faster me on that on it it may or may not actually do anything but I'm sure they're all the same size well you know we're close we're close [Music] - let me show y'all but he just dumped in his one can of Rotel yeah you can use a original or the heart whatever you want we just have some original on hand now this officer is done we'll drain the grease from it and dump it in here as well let it melt and that one's done so simple [Music] it's kind of full there bunk I'm trying to get some cheese edge mixed in with the sausage [Music] okay so once you get this kind of start together you're just going to pop a lid on it and as it continues to melt you can stir it in a little bit more but that is a pot of yumminess right there all right so now that we have our salsas cheese dip going and our meatballs I'm going to go ahead and get started on our buffalo chicken dip we're actually making it into like one of the little rings so we're just going to take some crescent rolls stuff it with the dip and then bake it in the oven and I thought that was like a cool way to be able to kind of eat it without having to let go back and get more it's like you have your own little crescent roll to yourself anyways I don't feel like easy pickup food so first of all we have a chicken that bunky has grilled all we did was like put this in some Frank's Red Hot Sauce so that would give it some flavor so we're gonna go ahead and cut it up into bite-sized pieces and then we have some homemade ranch which is just ranch seasoning milk and mayo and then I have some Franks I also have some green Tabasco so I'll mix those two together and then we're also going to mix in some blue cheese we have some cream cheese and all three of the other cheeses that you could ever want is all set but we just got out to see which ones we wanted to make so anyways I'm gonna go ahead and start making our actual buffalo chicken dip and then um since I get made we'll put it to the top every put it in the oven it'll be done another super simple appetizer let's get going [Music] okay so immobile I have half a block of cream cheese I'm gonna go ahead and add in all the chicken that Bucky just put then I'm going to add in half a cup of ranch dressing as much hot sauce as you want I like it extra spicy while added some green tea I'm gonna add in just a little bit of garlic powder [Music] and then I'm gonna start mixing this together and then once I get it more combined I'll start adding in some cheese [Music] okay so now that I've got it pretty much combined I'm gonna start adding in my cheese's so I'm just adding this one because we have it and thought it sounded really good for this it's a hot hell up in the oven aro that way it'll give it a little bit more spice and then I'm gonna of course anam blue cheese and I think I'm just gonna do a little bit of sharp cheddar I may throw in a few sprinkles mozzarella but I doubt it so anyway I'm gonna start adding in my cheese [Music] I could literally just eat this with a fork oh my gosh I am like salivating right now okay so now that we have our mixture which by the way I was just in here eating out with some tortilla chips and it's incredible we're gonna go ahead and make our ring so I just have my little paintbrush chef stone here monkey is going to assemble our ring because he is way more precise than me and I play make a mess show us what you got all right let's do it [Music] so after bunkie got my little crescent roll triangles down I just want even added a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese and then of course it done to the mixture on top bunkie said that bowl would have helped me stay in the line so that's why he put it down and then I just went in and topped it with a little bit more cheese and then you can see bunkie just flip over all of the crescent rolls to make a perfect little ring it was so simple and easy and I think a crescent roll makes anything taste better the buffalo chicken dip leftover so I just put it in this Pyrex and cover it with some more cheese we're just gonna pop it in the oven I'll let this melt while that cooks and then our meatballs are looking so good I had a few those little mozzarella pearls left so I just shoved them in there so they'll melt I'll be good and then this cheese dip is coming together - mm-hmm okay so our buffalo chicken ring is out of the oven it looks awesome and then this is just that little bit of dip that I put in there and I've already clearly eaten like three bites of it it was delicious and then bunkies a cheese dip looks so good it's bubbling away oh my gosh Oh amazing and then our meatballs only have about 30 minutes left those are looking good so we're actually going over to our neighbors house oh we usually spend some days over there and watch football games with all of our neighbors they're more like our friends and family but um I'm gonna go ahead and pack all this up and take it over with me so tonight we're gonna have a lot of good food and then of course when the meatballs are done well tell you guys how we like them and I'll show you the inside and see if like the cheese melted and all of that but everything just looks so good I don't think I'm gonna make my crack dip I made it one other time and I'll find that video and link it for you guys um in the description box but I realized I didn't have any potato chips and you really want to eat it with potato chips or carrots and also we have any of those either so anyways I'm probably not gonna make that but I will make it again in another video so this is probably all that I'm gonna make but y'all I am like salivating over here I cannot wait for it to all be finished that I can start eating the meatballs are amazing you all they turned out so good and we even had them the next night was just a little bit of spaghetti so we had like spaghetti and meatballs they were perfect and act like even better the next day but they were definitely a hit and we'll be making them again are you all so that's gonna do it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and got lots of great inspiration for your Super Bowl party if you did be sure to give this video a thumbs up and if you're new I would love for you to join my YouTube family so make sure you hit that subscribe button before you leave I love you so very much and I'll see you guys the next one Daniel [Music];['primeros']

cE2p7gPCGdI.json;hey lovelies I think we can all agree that there is nothing quite like chicken noodle soup to cure what ails EO but I've been looking for tasty ways to spice it up a little bit and I think I found just the thing this asian-inspired take on chicken noodle soup is just as satisfying as the classic and boasts all of the same cold fighting benefits it's basically the Super Heroes it all starts with my soup pot on the stove is all my soup recipes do and I'm just gonna heat up some oil once that oil is nice and hot I'm going to toss in some onion and some thinly sliced red bell pepper we're just going to give these a bit of a head start maybe three to four minutes just to allow them to soften up a little bit next we are going to add in the trifecta of flavor I've got some garlic some red chilies and some freshly grated ginger let me just tell you this if you were feeling under the weather you just double or triple the amount of ginger in this it'll cure what ails you once those have had a nice chance to heat through after maybe a minute we are going to add some curry paste to this curry paste can usually be family in the international aisle at your supermarket it's really just a mixture of wonderful curry spices and flavors but they've already done the work for you by putting it in a paste so it's great to have on hand I always keep some in my refrigerator for an occasion like this I'm also going to add a few splashes of fish sauce if you are vehemently against fish sauce by all means you can leave it out or add some soy sauce or tamari in its place this just adds a little bit of tasty umami flavor that I absolutely love and seems like that once you've got all your flavors built into your pan you can go ahead and add some cooked shredded chicken if you don't want to use chicken here you always have the option to use some shrimp instead or some tofu both would work really really well then we are going to add some coconut milk I'm also going to add some chicken broth to this when it comes to battling colds and flu season I am a big believer that homemade chicken broth is the way to go so if you want to go ahead and make your chicken broth you should definitely check out this video it is really really tasty and I always think absolutely worth the effort once this mixture has come to a boil you can reduce your heat to medium low and let it simmer away for just about five or ten minutes this doesn't take long at all since that chicken has already cooked and you really just want to let those flavors sort of come together and reach their maximum potential at the very end of that simmering process you're going to go ahead and add your noodles in this case I am using some ramen noodles you always have the option to use some rice noodles in this recipe instead I love both of these options because they cook in just two or three minutes so once they're in the pot you're just gonna pop your lid back on let them simmer until they're nice and soft then you can finish this soup off by stirring in some freshly chopped cilantro and the zest and juice of a lime now that my friends is some chicken soup for the soul and for the immune system I hope you will give this tasty recipe a try if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because I always love seeing your kitchen creations be sure to check out all of the other tasty tasty tasty soup recipes in this playlist because I've got a lot of delicious soup recipes and if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more soup deliciousness where this came from;['primeros']
CMVe4DyayPA.json;hey Leslie is over the last few weeks I've been sharing some delicious no cook recipe ideas to help you beat the summer heat this season and today I've got three more tasty ways to do just that I am sharing some yummy chilled soup recipes I know some of you might be skeptical but I assure you not only are these summer soups light and fresh but they are also packed with great flavor and they also happen to be really nutritious so there's a time to love now we're gonna get started with a classic chilled summer soup but you might have heard of this is gazpacho and it's made with a base of beautiful tomatoes the little cucumber some peppers lots of good stuff now first I am using some nice ripe roma tomatoes of course they are available in abundance in the summer as you can see I have removed the seeds what we're trying to do is take out a lot of the liquid in the tomatoes because we don't want this to be too watery we want it to still have a little bit of body same story with my cucumber as you can see I've peeled and seeded this as well peeling it helps give you a much nicer texture in your go spot oh and removing the seeds is again going to remove some of that water so you don't get something that's too liquidy I've also got some red bell pepper headed into my blender with a little onion and a whole clove of garlic then for a slightly stranger ingredient I have some crusty bread that I removed the crust from headed into my blender I know this sounds a little weird but it creates such a nice body in your gazpacho you will not regret it for a little bit of Tang I'm adding some red wine vinegar I've got a little bit of olive oil headed in here it's almost like a liquefied salad in a way I've got some ground cumin headed in here and then of course I have to hit this really liberally with salt and pepper will pop the lid on our blender give it a whirl and there you go this batch August batch o is done I like putting it back in the refrigerator for between 30 minutes and an hour because it is best served super super cold super cool chilled soup got it super next we're something even more refreshing I am serving up a chilled creamy cucumber and avocado soup that honestly tastes like something you would get at a spa it all starts with two cucumbers like I did with the gazpacho I have removed the seeds we've eliminated a lot of the water in our cucumber next I'm going to add some avocado to that also for some additional creaminess I am using a some plain yogurt then I'm going to add lots of fresh herbs so I'm doing that with some parsley I've got some freshly chopped dill here as well and then I've got some green onions for a really great tank and even more bright citrusy flavor I am hitting this with the zest and juice of a lemon that really makes this thing and then we'll just finish it off once again with a good helping of salt and pepper and give it all a good blend the team and I were having a big chat about whether or not these actually constitute soups or if they're more like savory smoothies I honestly could go either way I like to add a little more fresh dill for garnish and that is one delicious way to get your soup bar our final recipe today guys is one that you actually have to taste to believe it's a chilled southwestern corn soup and it is unbelievably yummy the best part is it is made with fresh corn cut right off the cob as you may or may not know by now I am sort of obsessed with corn this summer I think I've pretty much used it in almost every video I've made over the last month let's be honest the summer is just time for corn so I'm gonna get my corn kernels uncooked straight into my blender to that I'm going to add some yellow bell pepper of course you could use any color bell pepper you wanted to but I want to keep my soup nice and yellow so yellow bell pepper totally made sense next I'll add some green onion to my blender as well as half a clove of garlic now I'm using half a clove here because my cloves were sort of enormous and I didn't want to overpower this soup but of course you can use as little or as much garlic as you like now to make this a little creamy and a little rich I'm going to be adding some sour cream to this you could swap in some plain yogurt if you wanted to this just makes it really sort of smooth and thick and rich and then I'm going to season this up simply with some chili powder and some salt and pepper to help this blend up really well I'm also going to add a few splashes of buttermilk to my blender buttermilk is great because it's a bit tangy and a bit thicker the perfect contrast to all that sweet fresh corn if you don't have buttermilk though you can use traditional milk that's fine too well put the lid on our blender give everything a good blend and once it's nice and smooth we can pour it into our bowl I like serving this up super cold straight from the fridge a little dollop of sour cream a sprinkle of chili powder and a little fresh cilantro make it even more delicious lovelies I hope these three no cook recipes make your life's in the kitchen a little cooler this summer I hope you'll give all three tasty

cSvb0edoHX0.json;[Music] hi folks are welcome to in the kitchen with Pete staying indoors a lot these days as we all are and as we all should but it sure gives me a lot of time to be creative and today I put together a delicious cabbage and vegetable soup I put a couple ingredients that you may never have used in soups but i'm tanja it makes it rich delicious unforgettable stick with me let's get to it I've got all my ingredients prepped and ready to go I'm using an 8 quart pot I've got my heat set to a medium to high and I'm going to put a tablespoon of olive oil now for what's also known as a mirepoix I'm going to add 1 cup of diced onions 1 cup of diced carrots and 1 cup of diced celery we'll stir this in for about four or five minutes and then we'll make a little spot open on the bottom of the pot add a teaspoon of olive oil and stir in three cloves of garlic that's finely diced stir that in for about a minute and we'll add one teaspoon of oregano 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning a teaspoon of pepper and then we'll add an 8 ounce can of core 28 ounces of diced tomatoes and stir in five cups of chopped cabbage and 12 cups of broth it's your choice on the broth you can use chicken or vegetable I'm using a tomato and chicken bouillon commonly used in Mexican recipes can be found in latina and Mexican grocery stores as you've noticed I haven't added any salt to this soup and that's because of the high salt content in this boyo here's another great option I use frequently and they come in chicken and vegetable and beef flavor booyah it's a paste it lasts in the fridge for months this particular one is organic it's called better than bullion and it's low in sodium now here's one of my secret ingredients 1 cup of Clamato juice now let's talk about Clamato juice for a second it's very popular in Canada in fact it would be hard to find a bar or restaurant that doesn't serve up the drink a Caesar or also known as a bloody Caesar it just has Clamato juice and vodka some seasonings and some people top them off with all sorts of toppings my buddy Andy let me show you a picture of some of his now look of Andy's dazzle his up bacon pepperoni sausage shrimp it's endless get creative make it your own the Bloody Mary the flavors are totally different more tomato juice based vodka as well and then some typical salt and pepper and seasonings I always found it on you just go south of the border down to the US and you can't find Komada juice in the bars and restaurant it's a great drink this one here actually is seasoned with pickled bean they have some different flavors it's outstanding and said the old famous Caesar to cure a hangover I've been using Clamato juice for years to enhance some of my recipes and soups red sauces spaghetti sauces Chili's and so on give it a try it's a great drink let's get back to the recipe now after the broth and the Clamato juice has been put into our soup we'll add 2 bay leaves and we'll bring it to a boil cover it lower the temperature and then let it simmer for about 30 minutes we want to get that cabbage and vegetables nice and tender now here's my next secret ingredient apple cider vinegar one ounce of it we have a lot of liquid here so it's not going to overpower the flavor will just help intensify the flavor of the vegetables try it I think you'll like it we'll let that simmer for another 10 minutes and it's time to serve it up oh my doesn't that look tasty nice and chunky there's a lot there I can share it with my neighbors and family and it freezes well for months oh boy I think maybe some nice fresh Italian bread with a little butter [Music] well that doesn't take long at all and let me throw another idea out there to you you have somebody who just has to have some meat in their soup how about chicken during the last 20 minutes of cooking your soup you can drop a boneless skinless piece of chicken it only takes 10 to 15 minutes to poach it in the liquids after it's cooked you take it out shred it with a couple of forks back into your soup and wall up chicken vegetable soup it's easy anyways I'm gonna enjoy this cabbage and vegetable soup just the way it is Oh [Music] that bra is so rich nobody would ever guess at those couple secret ingredients that apple cider vinegar and Clamato you'd never pick that up after but it gives it some rich flavors you're going to love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time say [Music];['primeros']

D8fZdey76hE.json;hi lovelies I hope you're staying safe healthy and happy these days and I'm so glad you're here for another episode of my cook with me series where I'm sharing some of my very favorite quick and easy recipes that can be made with things you probably already have on hand in your pantry your refrigerator or your freezer now today it is all about this incredible smoky corn chowder this recipe actually comes from my cookbook meals made easy but it's been over a year since I have made it at home and I just found myself craving some recently because it's really the ultimate comfort food it's sweet its savory its smoky it's got a hint of spice which is totally optional and honestly it is one of those recipes that I come back to over and over and over again my pot is heating up over medium-high heat and to that I'm just going to get a little oil happening here now in my cookbook this recipe calls for a couple slices of bacon but I will just admit that I didn't have any bacon on hand at home so instead I am improvising with some turkey kielbasa it's got the same smoky savory flavor so it's going to work just as well you can see I cut it into really little bit if you have bacon go ahead and use it if not you can use any sort of smoked sausage that you want to or you can skip the meat in this recipe entirely and just keep it vegetarian it's totally up to you basically what I'm gonna do is get started by getting my Cabasa into the pan and once that Kobus is in the pan I'm just gonna let it cook away for two or three minutes I wanted to just start crisping up around the edges it gives it a really nice texture and of course it brings out even more of that great smoky flavor alright so as soon as you start to see a little bit of that browning happening around the edges of your kielbasa you can go ahead and get your veggies into the pot now today I'm using a combination of onion celery and some bell pepper if you can't find celery or bell pepper you can leave them out it is totally optional you want to make sure though that you've got some onion because of course when it comes to sea onion is always essential I'll let those veggies cook up just until they start to soften between three and four minutes and then I'm gonna go ahead and add some minced garlic to the pan as well as one minced Chipko play pepper now I have to tell you two potent a pepper is one of my very favourite ingredients because it's got a ton of great smoky flavor and also a little bit of spice I'm using one chipotle pepper in this recipe because I don't want it to be so spicy that L can't eat it she does actually enjoy a little bit of spice if you can believe it I've minced it really finely and I'm going to get it into the pan now if you find yourself without chipotle peppers for this recipe not to worry at all you could swap in some chipotle powder here or if you want the smoke without any spice you could use some smoked paprika instead any of those options will definitely work once I've got that yummyness in my pan I'm gonna let it cook up for another minute or so before I go ahead and add my corn to the pan now I am using frozen corn here because that's what I had on hand but you could definitely use canned corn in this recipe or even fresh corn if you can get your hands on some it would be really wonderful here I've also got a couple potatoes that I've just peeled and dice and I'm going to get those into my pot as well next I'm going to be adding some chicken broth to this as well as about a cup of milk Gregg is behind the camera right now holding it down making sure everything's in focus and I've been trying to get him to come in front of the camera and say hi event it's a no-go one day I'll get him around here so we're just hitting this with a little salt and pepper at this point I'll give this only good stir and then as soon as my liquid comes to a boil I'm going to go ahead and reduce my heat to medium-low pop a lid on this and let it simmer away for about 15 minutes or so or just until those potatoes are nice and tender after 15 minutes we can go ahead and thicken this soup up now to do that I am using a combination of corn starch mixed with a little bit of water this is called a corn starch slurry if you don't have corn starch on hand you can swap some flour in here instead that will definitely work adjust as well then I'm just going to stir that mixture into my soup and you'll notice in just 2 or 3 minutes it starts to thicken up and get this really a beautiful rich consistency and it's ready to be enjoyed I like serving it topped with a nice big dollop of sour cream that cuts through that spice a little bit and I also like topping it with some freshly chopped chives if you have some on hand if you're looking for something rich creamy and comforting this soup totally hits the spot plus it freezes really really well so you can go ahead and make a double batch and save a little for later how convenient guys I hope you'll give it a try for yourselves and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because you always know how much I love seeing your kitchen

dfX_NJnN5DE.json;happy autumn everyone as you know the best way to beat a bulge Hill is a nice warm bowl of soup a few weeks ago I asked you guys to let me know on Instagram and on Facebook what kind of soups you wanted to see on the channel and the number one response was butternut squash soup so today I'm going to share my favorite butternut squash soup recipe and the best part is it's actually so so easy to put together so for this recipe I'm getting started a by roasting my squash and there are two reasons for this the first peeling a squash is a real pain so if you're roasting it you don't actually have to feel it until it's already cooked and then is a total cinch the second and more important reason is that roasting squash actually helps it develop a really beautiful flavor so it is totally worth do it all I'm going to do is cut off the top and bottom of my squash and cut it in half you'll want to use a very large and very sharp kitchen knife for this process because it can be a bit difficult to get through then I'm going to use an ice cream scoop just scoop out the seeds and I'm going to season it with a little olive oil and some salt and pepper I'm going to place my squash on a baking sheet into the oven it goes but 375 for between 45 minutes and an hour or until it's fork-tender once it's ready you can pull it out from the oven and then simply scoop out all the squashy goodness I'm going to set my squash aside and get started on the rest of my soup so I've got a Dutch oven heating up on the stove into that I'm going to add some oil next I'm going to add a handful of fresh sage leaves now it's going to do two things first it's going to infuse our oil with a whole lot of beautiful autumn flavor next the sage leaves themselves can be removed and saved for a beautiful garnish at the very end now that we have removed our sage leaves to our oil we are going to add a diced yellow onion and a diced granny smith apple now I love using apple and butternut squash soup because it adds a nice sweetness that you can't get without it I'm going to saute these until they soften up and then I'm going to add a whole lot of beautiful vegetable stock and my butternut squash you could also use chicken stock if that's what you had on hand I'm going to season this up well with some salt and some pepper and then I'm going to let it simmer for between 15 and 30 minutes once your soup is done simmering your house is going to smell amazing you can turn off the heat and you can either finish it off with a little bit of heavy cream or if you wanted to keep this recipe completely vegan you can also add some cashew milk that would totally work here finally the last step is to puree this beautiful soup and you can do that one of two ways the first is to use an immersion blender the second is to use your traditional blender you need to use extreme caution when blending hot liquids for a full how-to tutorial on how to do that be sure to check out this video I've also left the instructions in the description box below now that it's nice and smooth and gorgeous it's just a matter of serving it with those beautiful fried sage leaves and some toasted pumpkin seeds for good measure I hope you'll give this delicious recipe a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I love hearing from you and if you've got any great soup ideas you'd like to see on the show be sure to leave them in the comment section below and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there's lots more deliciousness where this came from;['primeros']

down in new orleans and um they just kind of gave me they like introduced me to this sandwich or whatever and i've always just kind of enjoyed it and i think it would be a very interesting thing to share with all of the people because i feel like it's very regional perhaps and like you don't necessarily unless you know somebody who lived down there or whatever like you're not necessarily gonna know what this type this little concoction is okay so monkey's gonna get started chopping his garlic and i'm gonna kind of give you guys the rundown of everything so we have this um i think it's called gardener i can't really say it but we're gonna drain that chop it up add it to our bowl as well as these little um pimento stuffed olives and then we're gonna add some oregano dried oregano and then a little like a black pepper and a splash of olive oil yeah as well as some garlic so that's gonna go in our sandwich we also have provolone um what's here mortadella ham and salami yeah and normally like this this is a shortcut right here um normally you would like take all of these individual ingredients and combine them together but this is great for the most part everything is like right here that you need anyway so yeah great time saver and then we're going to put this all into like pizza dough roll it up egg wash it bake it in the oven it's going to be so good um yeah look forward to it yeah look at that we got all this good stuff here there's so much more there than like what i thought yeah so we have some cauliflower celery there's onion some carrot red bell pepper and all these pepperoncinis i think there's cucumber in there too okay i'm gonna cut these stems liberally off of here oh my gosh it's so good funky i'm so excited for this sandwich no idea this is what i'm here for i know you are on game day so i just chopped this up and then i put it back i took it off the cut board put it back over here in our little sifter because there's all this like juice in there still and like i don't want my dough to get real soggy so we're kind of getting a little bit more of this juice out of here and that is delicious flavor you just thought that drink it you want me to no i will i think it's probably good for me [Music] is it good that is strong it was good though yeah it's like pickle juice really now we're gonna get started on the olives so we're just gonna drain these a little bit as well and then chop them up into like little tiny pieces [Music] this is this is not the best way to transport nuts he just said do you think i should add all of this i added all of it okay so we're gonna do a little bit of oregano pepper and like the tiniest bit of olive oil to this and toss it together yeah because normally like in this sandwich that has more like olive oil and and stuff in it because it's not like wrapped inside of something but i think with this being like rolled up and all that together like you don't want too much too much moisture so yeah [Music] i mean if you ask me you could just totally eat that with some crackers okay but he sprinkled his oregano in here that was about seven taps by the way seven taps to be specific okay what do you need next your pizza dough yes by the way i went to the grocery store by myself and all monkey told me was pizza dough so in my mind i got him just like this pizza crust sheet so in a can so i may have gotten the wrong thing i think you're really supposed to have like actual pizza dough so we're still hoping this is going to turn out fine um if it doesn't then we totally suggest getting the real pizza dough i think this is actually a very clever shortcut if it works if it works but i think it'll be really great which this by the way is just the pillsbury pizza crust [Music] like when i unroll this does this fold in half does this unfold that's all we got that's why i didn't get you as much uh mortadella and stuff because i was like this will be perfect oh it's just me you and jacob we're not feeding an army we're gonna need a rolling pin okay we're gonna stretch this dough out never mind i'll stretch it by hand okay i'll stretch it by hand hit me with some more olive oil okay i got you let me oh what that was a little bit more than i'm bargained for but you know let's just let's just get into it get into it look at that it's really stretching out i think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised i am actually for you i am impressed right now at the stretchiness of this candle i'm not gonna lie this is super cool actually yeah i agree i do recommend the extra olive oil on your hands yeah check that out bonk look at that it's pretty good we stretched it out okay are you gonna start layering yeah now you're only gonna put your stuff on one side because you're gonna roll it yeah [Music] let's go ham next though okay but you're gonna have i'm touching the ham because this is my lunch meat too i don't want you touching it with that stuff all right [Music] oh my god that ham looks so good okay and now the mortadella so that was salami is martinella kind of like bologna yes like fancy bologna but it has pistachios in it i think it just yeah it has pistachio and peppercorns in it if i'm not mistaken check that out huh this is like a sandwich lovers dream this is a sandwich fit for a king this is what it is that's a little bit of a double up that's gonna be okay though [Music] so you do your cheese next or do you add cheese your stuff actually we were supposed to put the cheese down first are you sure no you weren't it was the meat it was the cheese let me watch the video i know i know it was the cheese it's gonna be okay though because watch this right here do you have the camera on it's on bay look at that are you sure yeah i'm positive go ahead and start popping this problem now okay all right so we're using provolone cheese if you want to do swiss or mozzarella whatever you want but i think provolone's probably i think any uh melty white sliced cheese is gonna be just fun yeah oh my gosh how am i gonna roll this boo you still gotta put your other stuff on i know but then that's it so that's good i don't think you have to add all that unless you want to this is your sandwich no i'm not gonna ask quite all of it this is the flavor factory right here monkey one day we're gonna get you your own dictionary like you're gonna make your own dictionary with your words up mm-hmm i'm [Music] down see i mean i've gotten the majority of it right i guess let's see here oh my gosh i mean i don't like these things but i wish i did because it really looks so good it smells good too i'm gonna just add a little bit more okay basically all that why not right yeah now how are we gonna get this to roll up i have no idea okay okay okay well i'm gonna come at you from other side oh my gosh this isn't even gonna work boo i feel like i'm gonna need like some kind of support system here [Music] oh look at it here we go oh yeah we made it over oh my gosh i cannot believe you just did that check that out huh oh i pulled it tucked it i feel like i just need to pull this over that top part okay let me get your egg wash i'm like so impressed by the way that you did this and we're gonna kind of pin tuck the end here pinch um bt dub the recipe calls for sesame seeds on top of the egg wash but we don't have any so we're just forgoing that part dude can you believe that no i really cannot that is awesome i'm still just over here tucking my baby away i'm sorry bunk that is a loaf of love it sure is i'm honestly like so excited for you because i just know you are going to be so obsessed i just oh gosh oh what are you doing monkey i lost the egg you need him to beat that egg a little bit more i guess i did um go ahead and beat it a little bit more now b i got it um i don't even know i'm saying to you now okay so the recipe calls for there to be like little slits in here so we're just gonna cut like three on the very top you get more than three yeah i'm gonna do more than three this releases the uh steam from the inside did you know that no i didn't is that really even through there yeah it's perfect okay so now we're going to pop it in the oven we're going to do 375 for like 40 45 minutes yes hopefully we will confirm the cook time and touch okay so all that's in the oven i'm gonna go ahead and get started on this chicken i'm just gonna go put this on the grill but i did want to show you guys what i've had it marinating in so i did just a little bit of ranch dressing some frank's red hot sauce and then i did quite a bit of this kicking chicken to kind of give it some spice and then just a little bit of ranch seasoning and it's been marinating like half of the day so it should be nice and flavorful i'll go ahead and grill that and then we'll kind of assemble everything in the air just wait till you see this and by the way the recipe we went off of said 40 minutes but because we used this pizza dough we only did like 25. yeah we put it on 25 and it still has three to go holy moly y'all just wait till you see this i mean i am beyond impressed i'm beyond impressed bunky okay listen okay i grilled my chicken it's sitting here resting i'm gonna go ahead and pop my tater tots into the air fryer can i just tell you that i love air fryer i literally use it almost every single day it is my favorite kitchen gadget accessory whatever that i have ever owned i was gonna say bong for all the people who commented and said that we're gonna like it more than the uh other device that we bought they were totally right it's amazing we literally use it every day oh and whatever video it was recently although what i eat in a day and you guys told me to put my um hash browns into the airfryer i did that and oh my gosh game changer they were so good to thank you um anywho i'm going to pop my tater tots into the airfryer and then let this chicken rest for a few minutes and then we're going to make our buffalo chicken mixture and then right before the tater tots are about done we'll give it a few minutes um we'll pop all of that on top of them put it back in the air fryer let it melt and get ooey gooey and then it'll be done so simple and literally my mouth is like watering i cannot wait what i just the magic that's happening in there this i don't even know i want to show them so bad can i no okay they must wave okay b will you get my tear tights yeah okay so we do have the extra large airfryer so if you have like a smaller one you can do this in the oven just as easily i just like this would be like super simple and really fast and i did cover the bottom completely that way it like prevents more massive like the cheese oozing underneath so anywho i cover the bottom let's put these bad boys in i feel like you're crazy by the way for doing this yeah it's experimental just how you always say you're experimenting so am i well i know but i'm saying like well well yeah okay let me say let me say something else i'm not cleaning up whatever happens okay but let me say b i only am doing it in here because these get so crispy in there oh we gotta we gotta hurry okay okay let's get this going

are you ready yeah okay yeah i am we're ready i'm ready just wait till it comes up here okay okay all right good thing i cleaned the stove a little bit oh my gosh funky that is cheese oozing out of them things i do have a disclaimer real quick i didn't plan for the cheese to be on top like that so i think that was just by chance but we're thankful for it looks good oh my gosh oh my gosh look at that that's insane have you ever seen something so beautiful no never you know what i'm even going to say this that almost looks like a football it really does that's the laces right there and just pick that shut the front door take that thing and throw it in my mouth oh my gosh monkey i cannot wait for you to cut into that what are the chances that was a good football we didn't even plan it you knew all along okay while that rests these are in here we gotta get started on this buffalo chicken dip oh my gosh i have never seen a more beautiful neither that is beautiful let me let me instagram it just say guess what's inside okay okay so i'm gonna cut all of these up into bite-sized pieces we're gonna add in about half a block of cream cheese and then a little bit of ranch a little bit of frank's red hot some garlic powder a little bit more ranch seasoning because why not we'll mix that all together and then we'll add in some i got some gorgonzola you can use that blue cheese whatever you want and then also some sharp cheddar cheese mix it together throw it on top it tastes so good [Music] omg yeah it does okay got chicken really absorbs some of that flavor yeah i did [Music] okay about half a block of softened cream cheese going in okay now to this mixture i'm gonna add about a quarter cup of ranch dressing and then you can add in as much hot sauce as you want if you like it less spicy then do less you guys know we like it pretty spicy and then i'm just gonna add in about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of um garlic powder as well i know that air fryer is kind of loud so hopefully y'all can hear me good but this is pretty much like the consistency that you want and then i'm going to go ahead and add in about this much gorgonzola or blue cheese whichever one you want and then some cheese and after i get that incorporated and we put them back in we'll add a little bit more cheese to the top to make them nice and melted okay tots are like pretty much cooked so i'm

flour i'm gonna add some ranch seasoning lowry seasoned salt and garlic powder you guys know like our three favorite things you can add whatever seasonings you want and then i'm just going to add a little bit of beer to this until i get like a really good batter you can just eyeball that until you get the consistency that you want and by the way you can use whatever beer you want or if you don't want to use a beer you could use buttermilk probably like soda soda soda water or something like that you do not have to use the beer it's just easy we have it here so anyway i'm going to go ahead and mix it together yes sir you said we have it here well we do but the carbonation like makes it more airy exactly it makes it very light yes like what monkey was saying is um what we've loved about

gbAF0vBHRis.json;welcome to episode 2 of our soup series I am very excited today because we are making one of my all-time favorite fall soups French onion soup what I love about this recipe so much is that it actually happens to be completely vegetarian so of course for this recipe we are getting started with onions a lot of onion so let's get our chopping hats on shall we so the way I like to do this is simply by cutting off the top of the onions and then cutting it in half lengthwise then I simply peel the onion and cut it into little Halfmoon shapes today I'm getting started with some yellow onion you could absolutely do this with some sweet onion if you wanted to instead I would not recommend red onion though because you end up with a bit of a grayish soup and I just don't think it looks as aesthetically pleasing then I do that about 12 more times and what I end up with is a pile of beautiful sliced onions that we are going to caramelize for this soup I'm going to be using this large Dutch oven but you could just as easily do this with a large soup pot instead so I'm going to get started by adding a good glug of oil and some butter to my pot the reason we're using both oil and butter in this recipe is because the oil actually prevents the butter from burning which is exactly what we're going for once that butter is all nice and frothy we are going to add our beautiful onion when you first add your onions it's gonna feel like a lot but trust me these are going to basically sweat down to almost nothing I'm going to stir my onions until they're evenly coated with oil and butter and then I'm going to put the lid on my pot I'm going to turn my heat down to medium and let these beauties sweat it out for 15 minutes after 15 minutes I'm going to take off my lid and season up my onions this means a whole lot of beautiful salt and some freshly cracked black pepper I'm also adding a sprinkle of granulated sugar because that's gonna help our onions caramelize then I'm going to leave the lid off and let these beauties cook for about 30 minutes you're going to want to stir your onions every 5 minutes to make sure they're not sticking to the bottom of the pan after about 30 minutes your onions will look something like this beautiful brown caramelized and your whole house is going to smell amazing that means it's time to add our flour now I'm adding just a couple tablespoons of flour and I'm just going to cook them for about a minute to get rid of that flowery flavor then it's time to deglaze our pan no traditionally this is done with wine or sherry but I actually like to do it with some apple cider now I like to do this for two reasons first of all it keeps the recipe booze free which I know is important to a lot of you out there second of all it adds a whole other level of flavor because of its natural sweetness trust me on this one it is the perfect complement to those beautiful caramelized onions once you've added your cider you're going to want to use your spoon to scrape up all of the brown bits from the bottom of the pan next we are going to add our broth now in this case I'm using vegetable broth because I wanted to keep this recipe completely vegetarian but you could absolutely use beef stock if that's what you prefer now you could leave this soup just as it is because it is already delicious but I believe the two secrets to a great French onion soup our time and time so we're going to add a few sprigs of fresh thyme and then let this beautiful soup simmer for at least 30 more minutes one thing that's really important to do I put those thyme leaves in whole because it makes it much easier to fish them out after 30 minutes this beautiful soup is ready for the finishing touches so we're simply going to ladle our soup into some oven safe dishes and then top it with some beautiful crostini and some shredded Gruyere cheese then into the oven it goes until that cheese is buiid gooey and bubbly and the whole thing is just bursting with Auto flavor you honestly could not ask for better fall comfort food I really hope you'll give this tasty recipe a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I love seeing what you're coming up with in your very own kitchens and if you have any other great soup ideas be sure to leave them in the comment section below because I'll have lots more tasty soup recipes coming soon and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there's lots more deliciousness where this came from;['primeros']
GE3ULIJrqrs.json;hello lovelies sweater weather is finally upon us which also means it's time for soup season and today I've got three delicious soup recipes for you all of which contain just five ingredients and comes together in under 30 minutes so these are perfect for weeknight cooking first on today's menu is an absolute classic we're making the simplest chicken soup you can imagine I know it's hard to believe that chicken soup can be made with just five ingredients but it really is super simple to do I'm starting as I often do with my handy Dutch oven on the stove if you don't have a Dutch oven go ahead and use a soup pot instead become soup season I do always recommend investing in a Dutch oven I'll link a few in the description box below if you want to take a look for one we're gonna start with a little oil in the bottom of our pot if you've watched some of my other five ingredient videos before you know that oil salt and pepper don't count as ingredients in my world once the oil is nice and heated up over medium-high heat I am going to add the trifecta of flavor perfection when it comes to chicken soup some onion and some celery and some carrots now a little word to the wise the thinner you chop your celery and your carrots the faster your soup is gonna cook so I highly recommend going for a nice fine chop on those and then you'll have super on the table in less than 20 minutes what's not to love about that I'm gonna let these veggies cook up stirring them often until they start to soften and then it's time to add my final two ingredients which have just some cooked shredded chicken I used a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket but any leftover chicken will do and some chicken broth how easy it was that I'm not gonna pretend that this soup wouldn't be better with a little fresh thyme fresh parsley some garlic maybe but this is at its heart the base of any classic chicken soup so in just five ingredients you have a hearty soup I think your whole family is going to love we're gonna bring this mixture to a boil and as soon as it reaches a boil we'll reduce our heat to medium low and let it simmer away for between 15 and minutes or just until those carrots in the celery have softened up and are nice and tender and then this deliciousness is ready to enjoy you can season it simply with a little salt and a little pepper and get it on the table in no time flat the best part about this is of course your house now smells like chicken soup and that my friends is good for the soul next up for something a little more exotic we are going to be making eight high pumpkin soup of course pumpkin is super seasonal this time of year and I love using it in savory recipes just as much as I like using it in sweet recipes for this recipe I am using pumpkin puree you can usually find this canned in the baking aisle at your supermarket there's usually two different kinds of those so pay close attention one is pumpkin pie filling that comes already sweetened and spiced for pumpkin pie the other is pure pumpkin and that's what we want to use in this soup once your pumpkin is in the pot you can go ahead and add your Thai red curry paste which I absolutely love because it's already got a ton of amazing flavors combined in one single ingredient so you've got lots of garlic lots of ginger lots of chili flavor tons of deliciousness a little of this stuff goes a long way it's super flavorful and then I am adding some red chillies now if you're not into the heat you can always leave these out and swap in a little extra ginger instead it's never a bad thing but you guys know how I feel about all that good heat once that yummyness is in the pan we're going to finish it off with our liquids I have 1 cup of coconut milk netted in here and some chicken broth these are two absolute pantry staples in my household I always recommend having both in abundance in your pantry just standing by for this sort of cooking if you want to swap in some vegetable broth instead of chicken broth here totally up to you this is a really versatile dish we're basically going to give all of this a good stir and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat while we're bringing this mixture to a simmer we'll just get it hit with a little salt and pepper and then once we've got that seasoned up we'll reduce our heat to medium-low and let this simmer for maybe ten minutes or so we're really just giving this soup a chance for the flavors to come together and it's as simple as that you can serve it immediately it was some fresh cilantro for garnish what is not to like about this dish guys super soup endless supreme weeknight cooking am I using too many superlatives finally I'm whipping up another absolute go-to soup in my household it is my tomato parmesan soup and once again just five ingredients gets the job done I've got my Dutch oven heating up on the stove to that I'm going to add just a drizzle of oil once my oil is nice and hot I'm going to pop some onions into my pan and let those cook up for three to four minutes or until they're nice and soft then I'm gonna get some garlic into the pot now I am using two cloves of garlic here three four cloves of garlic will definitely work if you're a big garlic fan you can really go for it in this recipe since we have limited ingredients it's important that we get the most out of each and every one of them once that garlic is nice and fragrant we'll go ahead and add our tomatoes to the pot I like San Marzano tomatoes I think they are the best for cooking so if you can find those go ahead and use them we were going to get our Tomatoes into the pot and any of that additional sauce should also get in you don't want to leave any behind and then once our tomatoes are in the pot we can add our chicken broth once it's reached a boil we'll reduce our heat once again to medium low and let it simmer for between 15 and 20 minutes now I'm going to be blending this up using my handy dandy immersion blender so of course it's really important that you turn off the heat first and then you can just get in there and start to break it up I like starting on low to make sure there's no accidental splashes no one needs an accident in the kitchen especially on a busy weeknight you always have the option to leave it a little chunkier if you want to or get it perfectly smooth definitely your call for the finishing touches and a whole lot of extra flavor I am stirring in a heaping helping of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and then I'll season it up with a little salt and pepper and this beauty is ready for serving this soup can be enjoyed immediately with some crusty bread or you can go ahead and store it in your refrigerator for up to four days it makes really wonderful leftovers as well I hope you guys will give all three of these awesome soup ideas a try and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because I always love seeing

HaZLcL0fhko.json;hi lovelies as the temperature outside continues to cool soup season in my house is just heating up and today i've got an absolutely amazing quick and easy soup recipe for you that's perfect for busy weeknights but is sure to please even the pickiest of eaters it's this amazing tomato soup with tortellini parmesan and spinach and it's so super flavorful but really really simple to put together it all starts with a nice big dutch oven heating up on the stove over medium-high heat to that i'm going to add some butter you could use olive oil here instead but you guys know how i feel about my butter and as soon as that butter is completely melted i'm going to go ahead and add some onion to the pot i want to let that onion cook away for two to three minutes just until it starts to soften up and then i can add some garlic to this as well of course because this is italian inspired cooking i am going for it with the garlic i've got three minced cloves here you could go four if you felt so inclined and i'll just let that garlic cook away for another 30 seconds to a minute just to help it reach its maximum flavor potential next i'm going to add some italian seasoning to this now you can use store-bought or homemade here totally up to you i've got a great recipe for homemade italian seasoning if you want to give it a try for yourselves i'll link it in the description box below as soon as that italian seasoning is nice and fragrant we'll go ahead and add a couple tablespoons of flour to this so the flour is really going to help thicken up this soup and make it nice and rich and creamy but i just want to cook off that floury flavor for 30 seconds to a minute stirring it constantly and as soon as that's happened i'm going to go ahead and add my wet ingredients to the pot so i've got some diced tomatoes here you could use plain or fire roasted which are my preference these days i'm also adding some chicken broth to this veggie broth would be a great substitute and finally i'm going to add some tomato paste here tomato paste has a really incredible concentrated tomato flavor that is perfect in a tomato soup like this really really tasty i highly recommend it and basically all we need to do at this point is give this a quick stir and then bring it to a boil as soon as it's reached to boil we're going to go ahead and add our tortellini to this now here i am using some fresh tortellini that you find in the deli aisle at your supermarket you could also swap in some frozen here instead if you wanted to i'm using cheese tortellini but chicken or beef tortellini would work really well in this recipe and basically as soon as your tortellini is in the pot you can go ahead and reduce your heat to medium medium-low and let it simmer for just 8 to 10 minutes that's really all it takes for the tortellini to cook through and become nice and tender and of course you'll notice that that broth has really thickened up and becomes super super decadent that means it's time to add my finishing ingredients so to this i'm going to add a nice big splash of cream you can skip the cream if you want to but i really think it adds a lot to the richness of this dish i'm also going to be adding a nice heaping helping of freshly grated parmesan cheese to this so you get that beautiful savory umami flavor and i'll also be seasoning this with some salt and some pepper to taste as soon as that parmesan is fully incorporated in the soup the final step is just adding some greens to this i'm using baby spinach here you could also use kale if you wanted to and i'm just going to stir it until it's completely wilted which always takes about a minute or so and honestly guys that is it in under 20 minutes this soup is on the table and you are in dinner heaven it is super super flavorful and your entire family is sure to devour it like mine does i really hope you guys love this recipe as much as i do and that you'll give it a try in your own kitchens if you do be sure to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because you know how much i love seeing your kitchen creations this recipe like all of our recipes is featured on healthymealplants.com our amazing meal planning site that allows you to browse more than a thousand recipes drag and drop them into your weekly meal plan and then automatically generates your grocery list for the week so you can take it straight to the supermarket how great is that finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more deliciousness where this came from;['primeros']

i2_RLzH1qOA.json;hello lovelies our soup series continues today with my super hearty stick-to-your-ribs beef and barley soup I used the term soup loosely because in my world this actually is a lot closer to a stew this tasty recipe starts as most of my soup recipes do with a giant soup pot on the stove I've got some oil heating up and to that I'm going to add some beaks now in this case I am using some stewing beef I've just cut it into chunks and I'm going to pop it right in my pot season it with salt and pepper and then cook it until it's brown on all sides if you did want to make a mushroom and barley version of this recipe belittle the meat entirely you always have the option to do so you're going to cook your mushrooms the very same way that I'm cooking my beef once your beef is nice and browned on all sides you can use a slotted spoon to remove it from the pot transfer it to a bowl and set it aside while we get to work on such hang our veggies you can probably see a lot of flavor has started to form in the bottom of this pot that's always my favorite thing to see so we are going to saute some onions some celery and we're going to saute some carrots when it comes to soup this is pretty much the signature of great flavor I'm going to saute those for three to four minutes or until those onions start to soften up next I am going to add some minced garlic to this let that cook up for another thirty seconds where there is beef I think there should always be garlic we are going to start to amp up our flavor here by adding a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce we're also adding some fresh thyme leaves and a bayley then in goes our barley I'm going to let this cook for about two minutes or so stirring it constantly just until that barley gets a chance to take on a bit of a nutty flavor as it heats up then our beef is going back into the pan make sure you capture all of those juices that is flavor obviously and then you can start topping up with your beef broth if you were making a mushroom version of this you could go ahead and add mushroom broth instead we're going to bring this mixture to a rolling boil once it's reached that rolling boil we are going to reduce our heat to medium pop this lid on and let it simmer away for between 30 and 45 minutes you really want to make sure your barley is cooked through you want to stir it every once in a while and check that there's enough liquid in the pot if you find you're a little short on liquid go ahead and add a few more splashes of broth I like to season it up a little further with some salt and pepper to taste and then just a little bit of fresh parsley because of course adding a little green to things is never a terrible idea I'm just gonna say it this is definitely one of those soups that is totally worth the wait you can enjoy it hot right away or sort in the refrigerator for three to four days this also makes an incredibly good freezer dish stupendous really or should I say superb I hope you all love this soup stew as much as I do and that you'll give it a try in your own kitchens of course if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because I always love seeing your kitchen creations don't forget to check out the rest of the tasty soup recipes in this playlist your taste buds will thank you later and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more soup deliciousness for this game;['primeros']
IswXL5F9cqg.json;[Music] hey folks welcome to in the kitchen with feet today simple and delicious recipe is an appetizer it's great to have some new appetizers we'll make her own crostini not the store-bought ones you almost break your teeth on and then we'll make a nice filling with ricotta cheese roasted garlic some sun-dried tomatoes some herb mushrooms it's gonna be delicious you're gonna love it let's get cooking nothing like making your own crostinis as I mentioned at the beginning when you buy them from the store sometimes they're so hard have you ever had that it almost feels like it's gonna break your teeth this is the way to go and then you can put the seasonings on that you like they're gonna be delicious slice the crostinis as thick as you like I like to slice them to about a half an inch to 3/4 of an inch thick now we're going to brush them with olive oil give them a flip and we'll do the same to the other side you can get creative with all your seasonings when you're making crostinis but here's what I like to do just a light dusting of salt and oregano I've got my pan at a medium to high heat they don't think long you just want to get them to a nice golden brown color just like that give them a flip we'll do the same on the other side and then we'll begin to get our ingredients prepared for all our different toppings we'll need some roasted garlic for a ricotta spread it's simple cut the top off of a head of garlic wrap it in tinfoil place it in a metal pan and give it a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt that's it into the oven 350 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes and when it comes out look it you just squeeze it out as much as you like slice it off with a knife and there's your beautiful roasted garlic [Music] now I'm using cremini mushrooms you could use white mushrooms actually cremini mushrooms are just a small size portobello any mushroom is like a sponge they just love to absorb flavors but don't pile them up too high in a pan lay them nice and flat or you'll create too much moisture in your pan and save the salt till the end same thing too much moisture in them if you put the salt in early and then we'll add some garlic that's fresh out of my garden [Music] we'll need some finely diced garlic just run your knife through it several times and we'll set that off to the side in a pan medium heat we'll add a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil now take your time when you're cooking mushrooms it's like cooking a fine steak you want to sear each side of them take your time don't pile them up once we've got our mushrooms to a golden brown well clear out a little spot for our garlic to go into just lay it into the pan and then we'll add a teaspoon of olive oil let that heat up for about a minute or so garlic cooks very quickly and once those flavors and aromas start coming out we can incorporate that into our mushrooms only takes about 30 seconds to get all those flavors mixed around you'll be able to smell that beautiful aroma when the mushrooms are done we'll add a pinch of salt and we'll set these off to the side and then we'll begin to get ready to put together our ricotta spread [Music] I've got all my ingredients laid out we'll need one head of roasted garlic one cup of ricotta cheese one tablespoon of Parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning one tablespoon of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of olive oil I like to use my little electric mixer it does a great job mixing together all these flavors you could alternatively put it in a bowl and mix it all up with a fork place all the ingredients into the electric mixer it only takes about 15 to 20 seconds give it a good mix you can taste it for salt at this point and then we'll set that off to the side and let's begin to build our crostinis [Music] so when you're putting your ricotta mix on lay it on as thick as you like this stuff is so good and our mushrooms Oh outstanding I think three mushrooms on each one will work out just perfect and the sun-dried tomatoes dice them up as fine as you like or put them on on whole pieces these are the sun-dried tomatoes that come in a jar packed in oil I like to put the whole piece of sun-dried tomato on now we'll lay a nice piece of fresh arugula it not only looks nice but it gives a little peppery flavor now after you put that little piece of arugula on here's the showstopper dazzle this with some balsamic glaze this stuff is so tasty it's thick like syrup let's go to it give it a nice those drizzle look at that now that finishes it off beautifully the guests will come back for more for sure now when you're done having fun drizzle in that balsamic glaze let's pretty it up with a

j0jXfMKvBok.json;hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen what peak today simple and delicious recipe is French onion soup if you've watched my videos you know I often encourage you to change things up make it your own take things out that you don't like put things in that you do like I learned this recipe for my dad many years ago and I've tweaked it along the way often I'm asked what type of onions to use and I found out of experimenting over the years I like to mix them up if you're only going to use one use a sweet yellow onion but I like to use two sweet yellow onions one white and one red let's slice these up finger leaders Diamond rings me in a moment for another man things you'll want them to end up about a quarter of an inch thick they're easy to separate and they're kind of stringy like that now I know that looks like an awful lot of onions but they're gonna reduce so I'm gonna be using my heavy stock pot and start off with three tablespoons of olive oil my onions let's get cooking the onions are mixed well with the olive oil they're all separated we'll get that on a medium heat we'll cover it they'll reduce for about 20 minutes you can see that they've reduced quite a bit and now we're going to get to the Browning stage so for this we're gonna add just another over the teaspoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of sugar this will help to brown up the onions and three tablespoons of butter [Music] we're gonna get our heat up a little higher now now this is the important part you must watch you don't want to overdo them you don't want to end up with black onions but you have to be patient it takes a while so we're going to leave the lid off and just stir this every few minutes and keep a close eye on it they will begin to stick on the bottom of the pot and that's okay just use your wooden spoon to keep rubbing them off and any pieces that get stuck on there will be glazed that in a few minutes we're about ten minutes in now you may want to use an oven mitt when you're stirring constantly it gets pretty hot in there so this second step of browning the onions they're all nice and golden brown now for the last minute I'm going to add a couple seasonings half a teaspoon of dried thyme one teaspoon of each salt and pepper and some fresh garlic this garlic is from my garden we grow fresh garlic at my mother and father in law's and use the fresh garlic for this this is three cloves finely diced and we'll cook that in here just for one minute garlic burns very easily now our next step will be to add OBO 3/4 of a cup of white dry wine and see this helps get all the little bits off the bottom and the last item before we add our stock I'm going to add a teaspoon of flour this will just give us a little bit of richness a little thicker texture for our French onion soup now it's time to add the beef stock two boxes in Canada you'll find the 900 mil or in the US it's 32 ounces so 2 boxes of that now this is a low-sodium and those salt out of it it's really quite bland but with all the flavors I put in there it'll be nice and as far as the sodium level goes I've only added 1 TSP of salt but I am gonna add some beef base this a little trick I use for just gives your soups a little extra richness you can tweak it at the end if you like if you're not happy with putting this in I'm just gonna put about a teaspoon in that will enhance my beef flavor it's a beef base you can get it and check in it's a handy little thing to have in the fridge if you just want to tweak your soups and sauces and then we're gonna put two bay leaves in I'm gonna bring this to a boil we'll let it simmer for 30 minutes and then it'll be time to serve it up so here's what you're going to need to make that classic decadent French onion soup I've got a cookie sheet that I cover with tin foil just for easy cleanup an oven-safe hole an English muffin toasted you can cut that up into little squares if you like or you can just drop it right on top after and then some fresh Swiss cheese you can use grier cheese you can mix square and Swiss I however go to the deli get slices of fresh Swiss cheese and I set them off set like so and when I lay that over the top you get that little bit of drizzle over the sides it's perfect and then I top that off with a little fresh grated Parmesan so let's preheat the oven to broil put this together and get it in the oven [Music] [Music] well I hope you enjoyed that recipe don't forget to subscribe to my videos on YouTube you'll get notified every Monday when I put out a new recipe video they're always simple and delicious and I can't wait to get in and try this one I gotta tell you my mouth is watering over this one I did let it cool down a bit oh boy Wow beefy cheesy underneath you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see station for the next great reason little either way I do well if you don't is over too;['primeros']

j_xIrTf4uYs.json;[Music] this week on in the kitchen with pete we're putting together a delicious pasta dish [Music] welcome to in the kitchen with pete today we're doing a delicious tomato mushroom rigatoni and then rather than throwing it all into one pot we're gonna layer those seasonings along the way you'll end up with a much more deep luxurious sauce you're gonna love it let's get to it let's do a little prep work we're going to need eight ounces of mushrooms clean them with a damp paper towel if you submerge them in water they're like a sponge it'll just suck up all that water here's a little tip slicing up the mushrooms make your first cut and now you have a flat surface and cut away from there first cut flat surface done simple as that our next item to prep is two large cloves of garlic and we want those smashed so give them a smash pull off the skins cut off each end and voila there's your two lovely pieces of garlic and then we'll give those a smash look at that perfect and we'll set those off to the side next item we'll need 2 to 3 tablespoons of finely diced onions you can run your knife through them a couple of times and then we'll set those off to the side you can purchase mild italian ground sausage meat or i just have some sausage here and i'm going to remove the skins also known as the casing just simply slice the sausage and remove the casing now let's get to the sauce it's important to use a good quality tomato san marzano that's the one to get 1 16 ounce can of that and then we'll use a 22 ounce jar of san marzano strained tomatoes don't skip on the quality of these tomatoes it really makes a difference break them up with your hands or a potato masher like i'm doing and next we'll add one six ounce can of tomato paste and season it with one teaspoon of oregano and a half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and then next we'll add our smashed garlic and our two to three tablespoons of finely diced onions six fresh basil leaves just tear them up and add them to the pot and to cut the acidity of the tomatoes we'll add a packet of stevia or a teaspoon of sugar and one pinch of salt now we'll bring that to a boil we'll reduce the heat to low and cover it to begin cooking our sausage coat the pan with a little bit of cooking spray or on a medium to high heat break up the sausage to begin browning it let's add a little more seasoning one half teaspoon of oregano and a half a teaspoon of garlic powder and a half a teaspoon of onion powder and we'll mix that all well and continue to cook until brown after it's brown you can remove excess fat if required my sauce has come to a boil i'm going to stir in the sausage and place the temperature down to low and cover it [Music] i'll use the same pan that i cooked the sausage to cook my mushrooms and we'll do the same process season along the way let's add one to two teaspoons of olive oil and a half a teaspoon of oregano and a pinch of pepper don't salt the mushrooms early it'll draw the moisture out you end up with a pan full of watery mushrooms we'll brown these up on a medium to high heat and then add a pinch of salt it's coming together let's add those mushrooms into the sauce and then we'll cover it and let it simmer on low for 30 minutes bring a pot of water to boil and we'll add two to three teaspoons of salt now how much reggaetoni pasta per person i know it's always a question about one and a half cup per person or i use my favorite coffee cup here one per person we'll add that to our boiling water and in 12 minutes or according to your package and it'll be done now while our pasta's boiling let's add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan this just of course adds some fabulous flavor maybe a little extra on top after the rigatoni pasta is done we'll just simply drain that shake it a couple of times get rid of the excess water and then into a bowl and now let's add our sauce now you can't just lay this on top and add a generous amount and then stir it up you want to get it inside that rigatoni it just kind of sucks up in those tubes and makes it delicious while you're eating it you can place that onto a plate a serving plate and then you can add a little more sauce on top and then maybe we'll garnish that with a little bit of fresh basil yes just like that doesn't that look mouth-watering maybe a little side of fresh garlic toast oh my you're gonna love it well that was another simple and delicious recipe i hope you get to try it out with your friends and family and if you like it i have over 150 recipes on youtube to date check them out i think you'll love them and don't forget to subscribe hit that little red subscribe button down below you'll get notified every time i post a new video thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pete until next time see ya [Music] you;['primeros']
KBdnLCFqFk0.json;hello lovelies now for some the arrival of autumn means a pumpkin spice latte or a fall fashion but for me fall is all about saddling up in front of a huge soup pot and getting my soup on today we are kicking off our soup series for the season by making three delicious homemade broth recipes I do get asked a lot in the comment section about how to make homemade broth and I'll admit sometimes I do use store-bought but there really is nothing quite like homemade so today we are going to make three different flavors of broth and it's actually a lot easier to make than you might think once you're done watching this delicious video I really hope you'll check out the rest of our soup playlist it features all sorts of yumminess like this french onion soup this incredible smoky corn chowder and this chicken pot pie soup which i think makes the ultimate comfort food now without further ado let's get started with our classic chicken broth so this chicken broth all starts with a nice big pot as you guys know already this is big red it's my favorite of all my many pots to that I am going to be adding a whole chicken you always have the option to use inexpensive cuts like thighs and wings in your broth you also can use just chicken carcass that's been left over from like a rotisserie chicken say from the supermarket but I always think you get the most value by cooking up a whole chicken because then not only do you end up with the broth but you end up with all of that incredibly flavorful meat that you can use in all sorts of great recipes now that our chicken is in the pot we can start to build in some flavor for my broth I always use the same combination of vegetables so I've got my onion my celery carrots and garlic when it comes to my garlic I don't even bother peeling it or crushing the cloves I simply cut the entire head in half and then pop it right into the pot now that we've got our veggies in the pot it is time to load in some more flavor so I'm using some whole black peppercorns in this recipe if you don't have black peppercorns not to worry just some freshly ground black pepper will do also I'm going to be a lot of beautiful fresh herbs in this case I'm using a combination of fresh parsley fresh thyme and a bay leaf don't panic everyone this whole thing is going to get strained out at the end of cooking so you don't have to worry about leaving things in big hunks like this next I am going to top all of this goodness off with water until it's all chopped up and then bring the mixture to a boil once you can see those bubbles breaking the surface it's time to turn your heat down to low pop the lid on and just let this simmer away now when it comes to broth the longer it simmers the more flavorful it becomes so if you have an hour use an hour if you have three hours that's way better you also always have the option to do this very same thing in your slow cooker once you've extracted all the flavor you possibly can from these ingredients it is time to strain the broth our first step in this process is to remove my whole chicken and transfer it to a dish once it cools I'm going to take it apart and then freeze the leftover chicken for recipes in the future next I'm going to remove all of my veggies we have two options we can either compost them at this point or if you're a real puree Asst you can go ahead and puree them and use them as fillers in things like soups and pasta sauces just keep in mind if you have left the skins on things you're going to want to pick those out first once all of the solids have been removed the last step is actually straining the broth itself I've got a strainer on top of a heat proof measuring glass that's really really important because of course this is still very hot and then to take it a step further I'm also going to add some cheesecloth to the top this is going to really help catch any of those little bits so that I'm gonna get a really clear gorgeous broth just begging to be added to a soup a stew a sauce any number of tasty dishes next up instead of making just a traditional vegetable broth we are going to be maximizing flavor with a mushroom broth I love this because it is completely vegan but really really savory and hearty and delicious and of course it features loads and loads of mushrooms in this recipe I'm using a combination of cremini mushrooms shiitake mushrooms and oyster mushrooms you can use really any kind of mushrooms you like in this even dried mushrooms work here once again I'm starting with a nice big soup pot on the stove I've got some oil heating up and to that I'm going to add all of my mushrooms and some onion within minutes your mushrooms will have lost about half their volume they'll start to release their moisture and that's when you know it is time to get the rest of your ingredients in the pot you know very similar to what we did with our chicken we are going to add our carrots our celery we're also going to add some garlic once again I've got a whole head of garlic that I've just cut in half we're gonna get that right into the pot like so then I'm going to add my black peppercorns and then I've got some fresh parsley some thyme and a bay leaf to give this a little more umami tastiness I'm also going to add a couple splashes of soy sauce it's hard to detect but it really does make a difference in the final flavor once all of that goodness has hit the pot we're going to simply top everything with water bring the mixture to a boil reduce the heat to low put the lid on and then let this simmer away after 2 or 3 hours this is the delicious result I strain it the very same way I did with my chicken broth and then it is ready to either be used right away or stored in the refrigerator for up to a week all of these brats can also be frozen for up to six months so go ahead and make a nice big batch I love using mushroom broth in all sorts of tasty recipes including this amazing one pasta dish this mushroom and barley risotto oh and of course this delicious cream of mushroom soup that I totally cannot get an F F finally today I'm going to show you a broth that I think is quite underappreciated it is a seafood broth now the star of this broth is actually some shellfish shells so in this case I have some shrimps show so I've got some shrimp shrimp shells shrimp shells by the seashore I've got some shrimp shells here after you have peeled your shrimp you can always go ahead and pop these into a freezer bag and leave them in the freezer until you're ready to make a broth like this they are going to impart a ton of great flavor now you can also use things like crab shells or lobster shells in a broth like this a little rich for my broth but hey you can swing it go right ahead to get this broth going I've heated up some oil and I'm just going to pop my shells into my pot I just want to give them a two to three minute head start to help bring out some of their best flavor I also like to take this moment to add a little bit of white wine now this is always optional but we know that seafood and white wine are a match made in heaven after just a minute or two of those shells hanging out in that wine you can start to build in the rest of your great flavors once again we are going to use some roughly chopped onion here got my celery carrots coarse some garlic and then what makes this broth a little unique is that I'm actually going to add a few tablespoons of tomato paste I really find that the concentrated tomato flavor is a great complement for the seafood in this recipe some little tomato paste really adds a little something to the final flavor of the broth in go my peppercorns and my fresh herbs and then I'm also going to add a few splashes of fish sauce now if you are not a fish sauce fan go ahead and leave it out but I promise you it tastes a lot better than it smells and once again I'm just going to top this with some cold water bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat pop the lid on and let it simmer away as long as you possibly can once this is strained it has such beautiful color I really think you guys are gonna love it I love using it in pasta dishes or things like Paia it also of course makes an amazing base for things like clam chowder I really hope you guys will give these a try for yourselves and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because of course I love seeing your kitchen creations over the next few weeks I'm going to be sharing more delicious soup recipes

kecU9qHaWic.json;a few weeks ago I shared three of my all-time favorite autumn soup recipes and each of the three recipes featured my homemade vegetable stock it turns out you guys are really interested in how to make it so I thought I'd make a video about it today I'm going to show you just how easy it is to make stock from scratch so as far as I'm concerned the base for any great stock is onion celery and carrot now when you're preparing these vegetables you don't even have to worry about peeling them don't worry about a thing because the fact is the vegetables don't stay in the stock we're going to be fishing them all out later so we're just gonna steal as many nutrients as we possibly can from them so I'm starting with some onions some carrots and some celery now I'm barely even chopping these guys because that's how forgiving the stock really is and look that's the base for any great stock now to that you can add any number of fresh herbs my preference though is always a mixture of parsley and fresh thyme I feel like these give the best flavor I'm also going to add a couple cloves of garlic because you get tons of great flavor from garlic before throwing it in don't even worry about mincing it just crack it open and then toss it in with the skin on and what we're going to do is fill a pot and cover our vegetables entirely now another great option when you're making vegetable stock is to use your kitchen scrap I like to use things like the core of a bell pepper broccoli stalks tomato scraps bases of things like celery and cabbage and even onion skins basically I store them all in the freezer and then when I'm ready to make a vegetable stock I dump them right into my pot all of these scraps even though they may not be edible are full of flavor and nutrients so we really want to get the most out of them so they're all gonna go in our pot as well we're gonna give this a stir season it with salt and pepper and then let it simmer away as long as you possibly can and I'm talking one to two hours even three after two or three hours you're gonna have the richest most beautiful vegetable stock you could possibly imagine what I love about homemade stock is you can totally control the sodium level and the kinds of vegetables you add so one of the things I like to do before straining through my fine sieve is to just lift out all of the larger chunks now we don't have to worry about getting rid of these now because we basically taken all of the nutrients out of them and they've been transferred to our incredible bra now if you're wondering why my stock is so rich and darkly colored it's actually because of the onion skins they actually die the stock and all you'll really have to do is strain it with a fine mesh sieve to make sure you're not getting any of the debris into the stock if you wanted it to be extremely fine you could totally also do this through the cheesecloth but I think that looks pretty darn good this nutrient dense stock can be stored in your fridge for up to a week or in your freezer for up to six months and it's ideal for things like these soups or these chilies or even for cooking your quinoa I love it for that and if you want to even take it a step further by making it a chicken or a beef stock you can easily do that by adding some leftover chicken or some beef bones to it and simmering it the exact same way I hope you'll give this stock a try and then it makes your life in the kitchen more delicious be sure to subscribe to my channel and see you next time;['primeros']

L1TFnkm1TG8.json;Nothing beats the cold like a big bowl of homemade soup. Today, I'm going to show you three of my very favorite recipes, and they're all totally vegetarian. I'm gonna show you a. delicious creamy tomato soup, a nice spiced carrot and ginger soup, and finally, a leek and potato soup that is extra hearty. I love them because. they're all super simple to put together. Let's get started with. our creamy tomato soup. Now, for this recipe, I'm actually using fresh tomatoes. You don't have to, you can totally use canned whole tomatoes, those will work just as well, but since I came across these beautiful, fresh Roma tomatoes, I decided I had to put them to good use, so I'm going to throw. them into our soup today. Not to worry about any. chunks in any of these soups, they're all gonna be pureed either with an immersion blender or by your regular blender, so you don't have to sweat it. In a large saucepan, I've. just got some oil heating up. Once it's hot, I'm going to add one small diced onion. I'm gonna cook this up. until it's translucent, and then I'm going to add some garlic, about two cloves in this recipe. I'm not gonna pretend. that I'm not cheating, I use the pre-minced garlic sometimes. Once the garlic is aromatic. and delicious smelling, I'm going to add my chopped tomatoes. I'm gonna mix all these flavors together and just let the tomatoes. start to break down for about five minutes or so. I've got a little bit of brown sugar for some sweetness and to cut through the acidity of the tomatoes. I also have some tomato paste, which is just gonna amp up that. tomato flavor even further. Once these flavors are all mixed together, I'm going to add some vegetable broth. I'm using my homemade vegetable broth. You can use any kind of broth you like. So, if you ever use real. parmesan in your cooking, you've probably ended. up with one of these. This is the rind of the parmesan. This is awesome for flavoring your soups. All I'm gonna do is pop. it right into my soup. If you don't have a. parmesan rind lying around, don't sweat it, you can. just use grated parmesan, it's equally delicious, and it really makes tomato soup sing. We're gonna let this all come to a boil, and then, we're gonna cover it, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for about 30 minutes or until those tomatoes. have all broken down. So, the first thing I'm gonna do is fish out my parmesan rind, and look at what's happened, it's totally softened up. All the flavor has been stolen from it, which I love, 'cause we. let nothing go to waste. The last step will just be. adding a little bit of cream. Now, you can totally skip this. step if you don't do dairy, but if you want a nice, creamy texture, this is the perfect way to achieve it. Once the cream is combined, we're gonna take our soup off the heat, and then blend it all up. Now, there's two ways to do this. The first is with an. immersion blender, like this. The other option is to use. your traditional blender, but there are a couple. really important things to keep in mind when you're. using this technique. First things first when. you're blending hot liquids, you should only fill your. blender up to half way. Any more than that and you. could totally cause an accident. The second thing is you. need to leave a place for the hot steam to escape. I do this by removing the. center of my blender lid. Another option is to just leave the lid slightly ajar so the air can escape. Otherwise, what can happen, is the lid can blow right off and cause a very dangerous mess. I've got my kitchen towel on top, but I'm still letting the steam escape. If you have to puree your soup in batches, no big deal, do it that way. Once you're done, you. return your soup to the pot, you can reheat it, and then we're just gonna garnish it with some fresh basil shreds. Next up is our super simple. carrot and ginger soup. Now, this soup really couldn't be easier. Obviously, it features some carrots and some ginger. It all starts in a large sauce pot. I've got some oil heating up and to that I'm going to add two small onions. To that I'm gonna add some. freshly grated ginger. Now, we're looking for. about one teaspoon, but hey, no one's really measuring, just put in as much ginger. as you think you'll need. I'm only adding this now just. to heat it up a little bit to get that flavor amped up even more. Then, I've just chopped. up about eight carrots. I'm using organic carrots, so I don't bother peeling them. If you're using conventional carrots, you probably want to peel them first. I just clean mine off. with a vegetable brush to dislodge any dirt left behind. Then I'm gonna toss in my carrots and top it with some vegetable stock. Once this comes to a boil, we're gonna season it with a good helping of salt, and some pepper. I'm gonna let this simmer. for about 30 minutes until the carrots are totally soft and starting to fall apart. Once that happens, it's. time to blend this up. I'm gonna turn this heat off, and we're gonna let it. sit for just a few minutes before we use our immersion. blender to puree it. You want it all the way inside the pot because you don't want it splashing back. Then you'll start with just a few pulses, and then just start working. your way around your soup. When it's done, it will. be creamy and filling. Perfect when topped with just a little bit of fresh yogurt and some fresh ground pepper. I cannot tell you how excited I get when leeks come into season, and one of my favorite. ways to prepare them is in leek and potato soup. Now, if you're not familiar with leeks, they're basically a cousin of the onion, but with a much milder flavor. When it comes to leeks, there is the delicious part, and the not so delicious part. Basically what you want to do is take your leek and cut off the dark green parts. Those parts aren't very yummy. I like to peel off the. first layer of my leek. Then, you're gonna cut off. the bottom of the leek. Then, you're going to. split your leek in half and chop it up really well. It's really important. to rinse your leeks well because dirt likes to get stuck inside the rings of the leek, so you want to give it a really good rinse in a colander in the sink, and then it is ready to cook with. So for this leek and potato soup, I have my leek standing by. There's four or five in here ready to go. I've also got a few potatoes. that I've peeled and chopped. Now, I have a large sauce pan standing by with some oil heated up, and I'm gonna throw in my leeks and a little bit of celery. Celery just adds an extra. level of flavor to this. These beauties have. already shrunk quite a bit. Then we're gonna add some garlic to this, and then, we are going to add our potatoes. I cut them pretty small just to make this process. go a little more quickly. Once these flavors are all mixed together, I'm going to add some vegetable broth. I'm also gonna season this with some salt and pepper. I'm gonna bring this all to a boil, and once it reaches a boil, I'll cover it, turn the heat down to low, and just let it simmer away. Once this has been simmering. away for about 30 minutes and the potatoes are. starting to fall apart, I'm going to add some cream. Give this a good mix, take it off the heat, and then, we're going to puree it in the very same way we. did the other two soups. Then once you're done with your blending, you have the richest, most delicious thick, creamy soup that is perfect for cold weather. This soup can be enjoyed. for three or four days or frozen for up to four months. I like to freeze it in. individual mason jars, leaving an inch at the top to make sure the jars. don't crack in the freezer, and then, I have these great. little individual soups that I can bring to work with me. What could be easier than that? I definitely hope you'll give them a try, and if you do, please tweet. or Instagram me a photo, 'cause I love seeing what. you're coming up with in your very own kitchen, and, of course, if you haven't already, be sure to subscribe to The Domestic Geek 'cause there's lots more deliciousness where this came from.;['primeros']

lH9oI9MGZTk.json;y'all I am pumped because we are in the kitchen today whipping up some yummy holiday appetizers you all know that is like my love language and someone actually told me on Instagram they said I think you are the queen of appetizers and I was like that is a title I am so proud to claim so anyway we're gonna get started on this first one we're making some Big Mac bites y'all they are gonna be so easy and so so good so let's get started okay so first thing we're gonna do is get our hamburger meat cooked and of course we'll turn off the grease I'm gonna season mine with some of the Blends because you know salt pepper and garlic what better to put on a burger I'm gonna get this cooked to drain it and then we'll start assembling yo I'm over here laughing at myself because you know how I always forget an ingredient at the grocery store and today I was like I did so good I feel like I got everything well of course to make these Big Mac bites you have to have like Big Mac sauce so in my brain I'm thinking like ketchup mayonnaise pickle like vinegar I can kind of like you know even I never made it I kind of just assumed all the ingredients well apparently I should have looked up the recipe because you're supposed to use like French dressing sweet pickle relish like all the other stuff that I do not have so we're gonna wing it and make my version of Big Mac sauce okay if this turns out good I will try and like leave my little recipe down below for y'all I'm gonna start with some mayo I feel like that's a good amount and then we'll add some ketchup I could have sworn it was mayo and ketchup I had no idea the French dressing okay that looks good let me go ahead and give us a stir see what the color is because I think the color is going to kind of tell us if it's the right amount or not okay that's looking good we're gonna add a just like white vinegar okay that's good I'm going to grate a little bit of like white onion in there we're also going to add like a pinch of sugar and then I'm going to like cut up this spear into tiny tiny tiny pieces We'll add a little bit of that in there too we're gonna make this our own okay pickle and I just tried to like dice it really small okay I'm just gonna use my little microplane to try and Grate this onion in here hopefully this is gonna work so yeah that's perfect [Music] y'all my eyes are watering oh my goodness I'm gonna have to walk away I'm over here in tears oh I can't handle it okay y'all what is the hack that will make you like not cry when you cut an onion I feel like there's some sort of hack I just can't think of it is it a wet paper towel sitting beside you or something like that if you know it tell me in the comments we're gonna add a little crack of salt and then a pinch of sugar I feel like that's probably good um and that's it I'm gonna get Bunkie to taste this and tell me if it even remotely tastes like Big Mac sauce okay so I thought that I had all the ingredients to make Big Mac sauce because I thought it was like a whole other recipe uh-huh but we didn't so I want you to taste that and tell me does it come close is it good does it need something else well it looks like the right color that's what I was going for so we're off to a good start okay smells about right did you know that Big Mac sauce also made of like French dressing oh me either but every recipe I look at it says that are you sure yes okay taste it that seems that seems spot on you're kidding no okay good I mean now it's been a while since I've had a Big Mac but that tastes right it is good yeah that's very good actually oh okay good that makes me excited I'm excited I cannot wait to eat this it's gonna be so good while you're down here will you um drain our grease off please yes okay so how we are going to make these little bites is we are going to make pinwheels out of crescent roll dough now I know that I could just get the dough sheet but I already have these on hand so I'm gonna use what I have so I'm going to open these up and then pinch all of my seams together so that virtually I have just like the crescent roll dough sheet um but if you want to just grab the Doshi at your grocery store do that okay I'm gonna need these to stay together more than this y'all I'm gonna have to like doctor these things back together [Music] okay so now we've got our dough put back together we're going to start by adding Our Big Mac sauce first and you want to save a little bit so you have some to dip them in and then just kind of like spread all of this out [Music] then next we're going to go in with our meat [Music] now if you want to go in with like shredded sharp cheddar cheese you could I have this like Boar's Head American cheese which I think makes it taste even more like a cheeseburger and it's going to be so good on here so that's what I'm going to use and the words of monkey crust to crust is a must and now we just sprinkle our minced onion and our pickles right on top now as gently as we can without losing too many things or tearing the dough we are going to try and wrap this up just like you would do a pinwheel and I may have stuffed these a little too full these went from like Big Mac to Whopper gonna like pull this over y'all these things are huge this is huge but I am really proud of the fact that like we didn't lose anything and we got it all to like stay together okay now we're gonna cut little pinwheels out of this okay so you want to use like a really sharp knife I feel like the sharpest one that we own and then I don't want to like smush this down so I'm just going to gently cut through it that is perfection and we're going to pick up our little pinwheel make sure it's really good and cut and then we'll just lay it on our baking sheet okay can we just take a moment for the beauty of this I'm so impressed [Music] okay now let's be honest with each other here I stuffed mine way too full I probably would have been better off with a crescent dough sheet instead of you know the crescent rolls that have scenes and I probably could have used a little less cheese but here we are I barely still lost anything over here so I'm very proud of that actually they don't look that pretty right now but I think they're gonna look pretty when they come out of the oven so we're gonna pop these in the oven at 375 for like 13 to 15 minutes okay y'all I forgot one ingredient so don't put it on there we gotta sprinkle them with some sesame seeds Okay are y'all ready to see the goodness of these things oh my gosh they're bigger than your regular pinwheel but they look so good and you know what I love like all of that meat cooked like even more in there so it got like really browned which I think just gives it more flavor [Music] stuff these a little bit too full yeah so they're Whoppers instead of Big Macs but they're not pinwheel size they're like pancake size but I think that's all the better you know that's a full handheld correct serving so like instead of eating like four you can just eat one or two right like you don't gotta feel guilty about you know getting three or four on your plate you just get one Big Mac is like one of my favorite you know yeah I know fast food items I don't get it very often because I feel guilty about eating it but I like the sweetness that the crescent roll is bringing oh good to the party very very prominent pickle which one would expect the only thing that I would say is I'm I'm not getting as much cheese as I'm as I'm looking for okay this is hilarious because I feel like I put too much cheese in there but here's the deal I use that Boar's Head American Cheese Slices and I think that just almost like dissolves into the meat you know like it almost disappears I think if you use shredded sharp cheddar it would give you like more flavor I mean overall still fantastic I was gonna add one additional comment yes please do I think for the presentation you can put these on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce wow because that's what you get with a Big Mac look at you B so just in case that's hilarious and it'll also uh you know for all of us out there who like that little that little crunch that little texture yes you can grab just a little bit of that Iceberg on the side and include it yeah okay so Bunkie wants iceberg lettuce and more cheese okay now this next recipe is for me because this has my name written all over it we're gonna make like crispy loaded potato bites using tater tots like I am the most excited I saw um in the kitchen with Mama Mel she made something similar to this a while ago and I was like I have got to make that and then I was scrolling through Pinterest and I saw this recipe and I was like that reminds me of that recipe I want to make this it looks so good so very very easy you're gonna need a muffin pan and depending on the size of these you can do like a regular size or the mini muffin pan of course depending on the size is how many tater tots you're gonna put in each little hole I'm gonna go ahead and spray mine and then I'll probably do four to five tater tots in each of these [Music] I was gonna make this whole pan but it ain't that's enough for me and you [Music] I might even make a couple more now we're gonna stick these into the oven at 450 degrees so it is a hot oven We're Gonna Bake these for 10 minutes on the bottom rack then we'll pull them out and we'll smash them and then put them back in now while those are in the oven we're gonna get started on our third recipe and y'all this one is like not a lot of cooking well there's no cooking at all it's more of a simply in preparation exactly the easiest but when I when I saw this recipe it and what a great thing to take like to a little get together because you don't even have to turn the oven on so let me show you okay so for this little appetizer you're gonna need like some yummy crackers if you can find ones with like seeds or nuts or Cranberries or you know all the fun things in there pumpkin seeds perhaps even better you're also going to need some fig spread some goat cheese prosciutto now I did forget the dates I forgot to even look for the dates I don't know it's fine it's gonna be fine they're like not critical to this correct if you want to add date spell means then after we assemble all of these and by the way you could also just like fry some bacon and then just like cut the strip in half and use each half on one of these if you don't want to use prosciutto would be equally amazing um and then once we get these assembled we're going to top them with honey and flaky sea salt like they're gonna be amazing okay we have like a rather large block of this um goat cheese I'm just only gonna do like half of it and you just want to kind of get in here and start crumbling it up foreign [Music] look at that smear that's the goat cheese smear wow okay so now we're gonna take our fig spread and then just add a little bit to the top of our goat cheese this is like the good stuff right here [Music] are these are 10 minutes oh my gosh clothes out it's been 10 minutes we forgot about the tots set a timer we did not set a timer but they're looking perfect yes okay it's been a little bit more than 10 minutes it'll be fine okay so now you're gonna take like a shot glass or a mini Juice Glass whatever you have that is small and round and we are just going to smash this right in the center see how it kind of makes that little what do you call it well a little like well the next bird's nest yes thank you my mommy said probably said that because that's where all of our cheese and bacon and sour cream is going to live oh this is like Perfection oh my gosh okay now these are going back in for about 15 more minutes until they are nice and crispy once the cheese get involved after the 15 minutes okay on top or middle oh we don't know I gotta close that oven back to my pretty crackers on top of our fig spread we are going to add our prosciutto foreign last but not least we are going to just drizzle these with some honey [Music] and then top them off with the tiniest little flake of sea salt [Music] foreign [Music] that was good that's so good like the goat cheese and then the Fig yeah [Music] and then you got the nice saltiness from the pursuit and then that wonderful vessel of a little cracker so good very good was it too much fig well he said I was too heavy kid with a thick spread actually no okay good what y'all did not just see was as soon as I opened this up and eat the tater tots out our smooth detector started going off Upstairs Downstairs everywhere I'm like fan it fan it with the um towel and I look over and Bunky's just like wiping the counters down and see if nothing's happening I'm like funky the smoke detectors are off they're like piercing so low our neighbors outside like grilling and bunkies just like cleaning the counters I'm like hello I can only I can only do one thing at a time I like okay open the door it's because the oven's on 450 that's like hot so when I opened it it like made this one detector go off I'm telling you it like melted my like mascara off monkey it's not a heat detector it's a smoke detector I said smoke detector I know but you're saying that the smoke detector was going off because the oven is so hot I think it is I don't think that's right but it might be true I think it's true okay I'm trying my cracker I know I say that a lot of things are my favorite but this one is your favorite I'm I was good that's a it's a nice little pickup handheld like takes the work out of off the person you know you don't got to get a cracker you don't got to get cheese you don't gotta get prosciutto all separately y'all it's all put together for you the flavors are amazing I love fig jam and that with goat cheese is a goat cheese is like very Tangy it is it's like a Powerhouse combination and then like prosciutto like you know always that's that is the goat always prosciutto and the cracker with the crunch like that is the perfect little handheld by appetizer goodness it is so great okay now back to our word to your thoughts they are already looking so crispy so I'm gonna add a little bit of shredded cheese to the bottom of each of these and if you want to cook bacon and like add your own bacon in here you can I'm just gonna do like the real bacon pieces because we have those and it's easy [Music] all the lighting in our house for some reason is so bad but these already just look so good so they're going to go back in the oven for just like five or ten minutes and then they'll be done we'll top them with sour cream you can do chives all the things top breakfast please don't let this mic to touch your coat off again okay I need us to talk about this like fig prosciutto cracker just for one more second because I truly cannot get over it I just had two more and for something so simple I just am blown away by the flavor how amazing they are like I'm mad that I did not get more prosciutto because I could truly eat like 10 more of those if you make one thing out of this video you need to try this like I am just floored at how good they are oh and one more thing um you can also top them with fresh basil which I forgot to get yo I thought I did so good and got everything in the grocery store but apparently I forgot a lot of things but if you have fresh basil actually that would even take it over the top I think the basil would like really yeah oh [Music] okay I'm gonna let these cool for just a second before we top them with our sour cream foreign [Music] for this taste test because this is like my favorite you know I'm scared they're gonna be so hot wow I heard that crunch [Music] saw a little cheese pull um satisfaction 100. you love potato skins you are going to love these it's like potato skins but better because this is like so crispy but you still get the potato all the toppings it's handheld bite-sized like so good also you could dip these in just like ranch dressing just absolute scrumptiousness oh my goodness which is the best idea what you can make these and instead of putting like the cheese and bacon you can put a tiny little sprinkle of cheese and then taco meat oh say say goodbye to the tortilla y'all that would be so good like there's lots of ways you can make these the first thing that I love is this spiderweb of crunchy cheese yes going up the sides yes that is awesome I'm also liking how crispy these things are looking they're very crispy that 450 degree oven Tim it's important it is because it gets you a real good like exterior on these they're still soft on the inside everybody knows that I'm not much a fan of potatoes we know but one of my favorite potato forms is in that of the tot yes yes yes I do love a good taut there's you can get me with a top yes regular old potato skin I'll pass on it right french fries don't care yeah right but this here is actually pretty good okay I'm so excited these turned out really really good yeah I mean not I would dare say that this is a tie with the goat cheese prosciutto figgy cracker wow I'm gonna put that one just like a notch above these but still these are like right up there now if if we did have my green onion or scallion on here it might put them over the top of me [Music] thank you;['primeros']
lN5rodbtclM.json;hello lovelies we have got a stupendous episode for you today because I am making still three delicious ways and I could not be more excited about it obviously the chilly fall weather has set in which is my house means it's jus season we're gonna kick things off today with a classic beef stew as always I'm starting with a nice big Dutch oven on the stove if you don't have a Dutch oven a soup pot will do as well here and I'm just going to get a little oil heating up in the bottom of my pot over medium-high heat once my oil is nice and hot I am going to add my stewing beef to the pan because things are going to cook for a long time and have an ample chance to break down and soften up and get tender you can go ahead and use way more affordable cuts of meat like stewing beef for example which is really affordable because it's not very tender naturally on its own but since it's going to stew for at least an hour or two it's going to soften up and become delicious all we're going to do is season it up with a little salt and a little pepper you just want to keep it moving to make sure it gets browned evenly once your beef has just browned you can go ahead and start building in your flavor now of course I love doing this with a classic combination of onion celery and carrot there's almost no super stew that I don't use these ingredients in I absolutely love them together we'll give that a stir and then we'll let this all heat up together for between 4 and 5 minutes just until the veggies start to soften up you'll notice the celery turns bright green that means we are ready for even more wonderful flavor I am using a combination of minced garlic a little bit of tomato paste and some Worcestershire sauce let me tell you these three ingredients pack a serious flavor punch will let those cook up for another minute stirring them constantly and then as soon as they become really nice and fragrant we'll go ahead and add a red wine to the pot now this is definitely optional you do not have to make this recipe with anyone at all but I do love the depth of flavor that this red wine as you don't have to worry about the alcohol content in this the alcohol evaporates and all you're left with is that cheap rich flavor guys I know I say this a lot but I really wish you could smell this one at this point we are gonna go ahead and add even more awesomeness in the form of potatoes then I'm going to add my plastic beef bra and finally I'm going to add some fresh thyme to the pot now you'll notice I didn't even pull the thyme leaves off its stem we'll get it out of there later once all of this yumminess comes to a boil you can reduce your heat to medium-low pop the lid on that pot and then let this simmer away now thirty minutes is fine here but of course when it comes to stew the longer its dues the better it's going to be so if you have an hour definitely take an hour if you have an hour and a half even better keep that puppy covered and let it simmer away until those potatoes are super tender and of course that beef is just falling apart the final step is just to thicken this up now if you leave it as is it's just soup but the thickening process is really what makes it - I'm going to be doing this today with some cornstarch you can also do this with some all-purpose flour it's totally up to you which you prefer they both work in exactly the same way to make this slurry all I'm going to do is essentially add some water chew my cornstarch and then give it a whisk like so you want to get it all combined so that you don't get any chunks of cornstarch or flour in it your stew I'm just going to pour it right into my pot and keep stirring this until it starts to thicken up season it up of course with a little salt and a little pepper and it is ready to be enjoyed I like serving this deliciousness with a nice piece of crusty bread slathered in butter and there you have it my friends dinner is served trust me it is totally worth the effort it's stupid how delicious this dish is next step I'm going to show you guys my hearty chicken stew now I will just tell you that both my husband and our baby to be are obsessed with this right now so I'm making it at least once a week and the good news is it's actually really really easy like the first two we made I'm just going to heat some oil up and once my oil is nice and hot I can get onions celery and carrots into the pot we'll let those cook away for a few minutes until they start to soften up and then I'm going to go ahead and add my chicken now this is a really wonderful recipe to use up any leftover chicken you have in the fridge with my chicken I am also going to add some diced potatoes into the pot again this is all about hearty dishes that really satisfied during the phone lines so they have to have potatoes in them once my potatoes are in the pot I'm going to go ahead and cover all of this with my chicken broth it's always a good idea to use really good-quality chicken broth in your cooking and if you have the time to make homemade broth I highly recommend you do I have a great recipe on the channel I will link it in the description box so you can take a look at it for yourself to add even more deliciousness to the pot I am going to be adding some fresh herbs so I've got some chopped sage headed into my pot as well as another full sprig of thyme I'm just going to let the mixture come to a boil once it's reached a boil I'll reduce my heat to medium-low pop a lid on and let it simmer away it for as long as I possibly can trust me my friends it was worth the wait coz things look and smell amazing I am basically going to go in and just remove my time stem it's always really important otherwise some lucky eater is going to have this in their dish probably not super delicious and then we can go ahead and thicken this up once again I'm doing this with a cornstarch and water mixture and flour will work just as well once my stew is thickened I am going to add three more delicious ingredients to take this right over the top first up I've got some frozen corn kernels as well as some frozen peas headed into my pot the best part about these is they only take 2 or 3 minutes to heat through and I'm also going to finish this off with a little bit of parsley which really helps to freshen and brighten up all the flavors I'll hit this as I always do with a little salt and a little pepper and seriously two to three minutes later you have what I consider to be a total kitchen masterpiece finally for all my vegan friends out there who are just hankering for a rich hearty dish to come home to on a cold autumn evening I am making a really really hearty loaded with veggies mushroom stew it starts once again with some oil heating up in my Dutch oven to that I am going to add some mushrooms of course in this case I'm using a combination of cremini mushrooms and portobello mushrooms that have been chopped up you can really use any kind of mushrooms you want in this recipe we're gonna let those mushrooms cook down until they've released all of their moisture and then we'll go ahead and add our onion celery and carrot to the pot we'll give that a quick chance to soften up over four or five minutes then we'll go ahead and add some garlic to the pot now this dish can handle a lot of garlic so two three four cloves I do not judge and let's be honest if everyone in the house is eating it it's almost like you didn't eat garlic at all thirty seconds later that garlic will be nice and aromatic and fragrant which means you know it's time to pile your potatoes into the pot as well as some barley barley is such an awesome fiber rich addition to a stew like this it's also going to help naturally thicken up your stew and then once our barley is in there we are going to add our liquids in this case I am adding some bass tomatoes and then some mushroom broth vegetable broth is fine but if you want a much richer umami flavor you definitely want to go mushroom broth in this recipe to add even more great flavor to this dish I am going to be using some beautiful herbs so I've got some fresh thyme headed in a bay leaf as well as some freshly chopped rosemary all of these pack a ton of flavor I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil pop the lid on reduce the heat to medium-low and let this simmer away it's really important that you give that barley a chance to cook through fully and usually that takes between 30 and 45 minutes so you don't want to rush this line and then once your barley is cooked first things first we want to remove our bay leaf and our time then you can go ahead and add your cornstarch slurry to this now this is delicious just as it is but because I am all about getting more greens in when I can I am also going to add some trimmed and cut green beans to this pot the good part about green means is that they take almost no time to cook so within three to four minutes they'll be nice and tender and ready to serve season this up with a little salt and a little pepper and oh my gosh guys vegan comfort food this do is I must say very savory Wow it's too much of a stretch wouldn't you agree I hope you'll give all three of these tasty ideas a try and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because they always love seeing your kitchen

MBL23KNDmFo.json;[Music] hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with super deluxe steak nachos that's right why would anyone make regular nachos when they could be making super deluxe steak nachos i know that is a great question but anyway with the super bowl right around the corner i thought i'd show you something that's going to be perfect for your game day buffet i mean when you serve something like this no matter how boring the game is or how lame the halftime show will be and it's always lame except when cher does it but when you have something like this on a table no one will care okay so let's go ahead and get started with the steak so what i have here is about a pound and a half piece of flap steak also known as flat meat don't worry it only sounds inappropriate and what we want to do is season this on both sides with salt freshly ground black pepper and some chipotle and while this flap steak is my personal favorite choice something that works just as well and is incredibly similar would be skirt steak which we have tons of recipes for so you should be able to get either of those cuts at any butcher but generally skirt steak's a little easier to find so that will work and why we want to do our steak first is because we're going to need to cook this and let it cool completely before we dice it to use on the nachos so once we have our meat season we'll head over to the stove where we're going to cook this in a little bit of vegetable oil over medium-high heat for about i don't know maybe six minutes per side until we have about a medium and i realize we usually shoot for medium rare or less but with this particular cut of meat in this particular dish i think we're going to get a better taste and texture if we go a little further and i'll touch on this issue in the blog post but one thing i will mention when you see them prep this kind of meat at the taqueria it's actually cut much thinner slices and they grill it until it's pretty much cooked through and yet it's still always incredibly delicious by the way one quick tip here please use a thermometer to check the internal temp i think we want to shoot for about 135ish and that's because i find this meat has a very soft feel so if you're trying to tell by poking it you can get fooled but anyway one way or another we're going to cook our meat to about medium at which point we'll remove that to a bowl to rest and as soon as we do we're going to turn off the heat and add a splash of water to our pan to deglaze all that amazing goodness off the bottom which as any self-respecting food wisher knows it's called a found so i'm gonna switch to a wooden spatula to make sure all that comes off the bottom nicely and then what we'll do is we'll pour that goodness over our meat and let it cool completely before we cut it alright i cannot stress this enough do not cut that meat hot or warm it should be room temp or cold like mine is here i actually cooked mine in the morning and popped it in the fridge till the afternoon and then once our meat has been properly cooled we can go ahead and slice it so what i like to do is make nice thick slices with the grain which for a cut like this and skirt steak is very easy to find and then we'll cut those pieces into two or three thinner strips and then we'll simply turn that and slice this against the grain into a nice small dice and because we let our meat cool properly not only is it easier to cut but we're not going to lose any of those amazingly flavorful juices so we'll go ahead and cut up our beef and add it right back into the same bowl it came from and we'll take a spoon and we'll toss it with all those beautiful pan drippings we recovered by deglazing and that's it our steak has officially been prepped at this point we could use that as is or we can just wrap that up and pop in the fridge until needed and then besides prepping our steak the other thing we need to do is get together our refried beans which is going to start with one of two recommended fats which would be lard which i'm using here or some rendered bacon fat so i'm going to melt a couple tablespoons of fat over medium heat and then into that we will toss a finely diced onion with the traditional pinch of salt and cook those stirring for about five or six minutes until they start to soften and sweeten and turn translucent you know the drill and once our onions are just about to that point i like to add a pinch of dry oregano and by the way if you have access to espizote that would be even a better choice but anyway i'm going to toss in a little bit of dry oregano and we'll cook that for a few seconds before adding our drained and rinsed canned pinto beans and this would be the perfect time to admit we're not making real refried beans here this is just a quick but still delicious shortcut version especially made for nachos so save your cards and letters i'm sure we'll do the proper version one day but anyway we're going to dump in our beans in a splash of water and we'll stir that together and let it come back to a simmer and i'd like to let it cook about five minutes or so and our beans are already cooked but i like to do that to make sure the onions are nice and soft and sweet and at that point we're going to turn our heat down to low and smash these with a potato masher or something similar and how smooth and creamy you make these is totally up to you you guys are the gauchos of your nachos so you're gonna have to cowboy up and make the tough call for how much to smash these actually i'm just kidding it's not a tough call because these are good chunky smooth or somewhere in between which is kind of how i'm doing them and then once those are mashed to our liking we will add more liquid to get the appropriate texture because keep in mind these do have to be loose enough to spoon over nachos so we'll stir in some water until we have something to look sort of like this oh by the way if you make these ahead they're gonna really tighten up so don't be surprised if you have to add a little more liquid when you heat these up but anyway once we're happy with our viscosity we need to season these up with some salt and quite possibly more than you think because what will happen is you'll add a spoon and you'll stir it in and you'll taste it and you will be shocked how bland these are so you'll add more salt and then it will be better and not that these need to be exactly bursting with flavor the beans are kind of a semi-bland glue for the nachos and they're going to go with lots of other flavorful ingredients but we do want them properly seasoned with salt and then once our beans are set we can finally build our super deluxe nachos so let's go ahead and toss some corn tortilla chips into a heat proof pan and personally i think two to three chips deep is perfect and once our pan has been chipped we'll go ahead and top that with some beans and how much to use we're gonna leave up to you as we will with all the elements in this i'm not going to give you a specific exact amounts for nachos that's crazy so we're going to spoon over what we would consider enough and then once we have placed down what we consider the perfect amount of refried beans we will go ahead and top with a generous handful of our steak and of course if you're vegetarian you're going to skip this step and instead i recommend maybe using some tofurkey or possibly vegan chorizo actually i'm kidding don't use either of those but anyway we'll scatter over our beautiful diced steak followed by of course some grated cheese and the classic blend would be 50 sharp cheddar and 50 monterey jack although if you press me i probably do prefer all cheddar but i thought i would go classic here and then once we finish sprinkling over this cheese we have two options to cook this we can toss this into a hot oven about 450 for 10 minutes or so until the cheese is melted and the edges of our chips start to brown or if our beans are still hot and our steak's not too cold we could have just done this under the broiler for a few minutes it really doesn't matter as long as your cheese melts and everything gets heated through and at this point because we added beans and meat we've gone from nachos to super nachos but now we need to go from super nachos to super deluxe nachos which means adding all the following fixings so first up for me i'm going to scatter over some nice beautiful ripe avocado that i diced and tossed with a little bit of lemon juice and salt and as usual all these finer details will be expanded upon on the blog post so i'm going to scatter over some diced avocado followed by some very finely diced onions and i'm using white onions because for whatever reason those seem to be the ones they always use at the taqueria they must know something and then after the onion we're going to do some diced tomato and i know i've told you to never serve tomato in the winter but unless you invited al's waters to your party nobody's gonna care and then to complete what is basically a deconstructed salsa crude i'm gonna do some finely diced jalapeno pepper and speaking of salsa if you want to use that instead go ahead i just think for me that's a little too wet and i prefer to use all those same ingredients in this diced form and then let's finish this thing off with some sour cream you can dollop but i much prefer to squeeze i just think it's much more visually arresting and then last but not least a whole bunch of freshly chopped cilantro and our super deluxe steak nachos are done i mean close your eyes and imagine that is the centerpiece of your snack table actually you know what open your eyes and look at it while you imagine that that right there is going to impress your guests and that's just the looks what do you tear into this which i'm going to do right now and of course like all platters and nachos you're going to have your two distinct layers your top layer where your chips are loaded with a little bit of everything and the bottom layer containing the clean chips with which we used to scoop up all the stuff that fell off the top layer which hasn't happened yet but trust me it will and of course it goes without saying that if you're not into group nacho you can easily do these as individual portions as long as your plates are heat proof you could toss those under the broiler for a couple minutes and enjoy the exact same thing in just a little smaller format but either way doesn't really matter you're still going to be enjoying one of the most delicious party foods ever invented just an amazing amalgamation of tastes and textures and i really do hope you give these a try soon so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] jerk chicken wings that's right as you know every year we try to do a new and exciting chicken wing recipe before the super bowl and this year we're inspired by jamaica's famous and incredibly delicious grilled chicken recipe which is kind of funny because they don't play football in jamaica the big sport there is of course bobsledding and while i do love this on grilled half chickens it is beyond fantastic used as a hot wing recipe so let's get started i mean these chicken wings aren't going to be jamaican themselves and of course the first thing we're going to need is chicken wings and there's mine i have three pounds and as you'll notice there's no flats this is made up entirely of the up part of the wing and i usually don't buy this kind i actually like the flat part of the wing but these were on sale and will work beautifully so i have three pounds of these we're going to go ahead and put those in a large mixing bowl because we're going to marinade these which is the next step so in a blender we're going to start with some chopped onion some whole peeled garlic cloves and a handful of chopped green onions and then to that we're going to add what i consider two of the most key ingredients some habanero peppers oh they're hot and some fresh thyme and for the time we're simply going to pick those leaves off that's easy and then for the habanero peppers all we're going to do is chop those up roughly but before we do we're going to want to remove the seed pod which is not hard just cut them in half and if you cut out that little top part where the stem comes into the pepper that's where most of the seeds are going to be located and above and beyond removing the stem and seeds you also probably want to remove most of those white membranes that is where a lot of the heat resides and these peppers are super hot to begin with so i'm going to trim that out although i will spare you watching that all right so we're going to trim those up chop them up roughly and throw those into the blender and like i said we're going to pick all the leaves off the thyme and add a good amount of that you're going to want a couple tablespoons very critical ingredients and then after adding the vegetation we're going to go ahead and spice this up and for that we're going to use a whole bunch of salt some freshly ground black pepper ooh check it out pepper sinkhole after the black pepper we're going to add a whole bunch of allspice another signature flavor in this do not skip or skimp on the allspice we're also going to want some dry thyme which is not easy to see because i switched camera angles because i was getting bored of the overhead view we're also going to add some cinnamon and a little bit of cumin and then last but not least for the spices a whole bunch of freshly grated nutmeg oh you gotta freshly grate it everybody's doing it so a healthy dose of nutmeg and that's pretty much it for the spices and it's on to the wet ingredients so let's go ahead and add a splash of vegetable oil along with a nice big drizzle of soy sauce and then to balance out all these strong flavors we're gonna need a little bit of brown sugar and thanks to angry emails from psychotic pastry chefs we are categorizing the brown sugar as a wet ingredient and then after the sweet we need the sour in this case we're gonna use a lime juice and a lot of it and we'll squeeze that in and that's pretty much it so we're gonna go ahead and take that over and blend that completely smooth and you know how we do pulse on and off to start and then we'll just go ahead and leave it on until it's completely smooth and don't be in a big hurry we want complete and utter liquefication which is what we have right here at that point we're going to go ahead and pour that over our chicken wings and of course give them a thorough mixing all right chicken wings are famous for their nooks and crannies and we want to make sure every speck of surface area is covered with that marinade so be very thorough and when you're confident that's happened we're going to go ahead and wrap that in plastic and marinate this overnight now that is what i'm officially recommending but you can get away with as little as a two-hour marinade and i will let you know how that works on the blog but anyway we're gonna pop that in the fridge for at least eight hours and then the next day we are ready to pan up and roast and to do that i'm gonna recommend you wrap a baking sheet in heavy duty foil i'm gonna give mine a little spritz with the canola oil if you're using that non-stick foil you probably don't need to do this then we're simply gonna transfer the chicken wings from the marinade onto the sheet tray and you can let a little the excess marinade drip off but you want these pretty wet so we're gonna place those on the tray we're going to distribute them as evenly as possible at that point we're going to pop those in a preheated very hot 450 degree oven for 25 minutes and by the way do not throw away any of that extra marinade we're going to go ahead and use the rest of that during this glazing process so don't throw that away and after 25 minutes we're going to pull those wings out and they should look something like this and then what we're going to do here is paint and turn so take about half of whatever marinade you have left over brush it onto the tops of those wings and when you've brushed a little bit on each one you're going to go ahead and turn them over and once we've completed that and they're all flipped over we're going to go ahead and pop that back in for another 15 minutes we'll pull them back out and we'll repeat that process only this time we're going to turn and then paint and you can see we're starting to get a little bit of caramelization all right so the first time we painted and then turned this time we're going to turn and then paint so we'll flip those all over we'll paint those with the remainder of our marinade and then those are going to go back in for another 10 or 15 minutes until they're perfect and you'll know they're perfect when they're all beautifully browned and caramelized and don't stop until they look like this what happens is people see that excess marinade getting black around the edges and they stop they chicken out like a bunch of jerks and they pull it out because they're afraid it's gonna burn but it won't that's just the edges so don't let those dark bits scare you you have to cook these wings until they're well browned and then one last tip let them sit on the foil for five minutes before trying to remove them as they cool a little bit they'll contract and they'll come off that foil a lot easier and at that point you are free to transfer these into some kind of serving platter i went ahead and cliched mine up with some crunchy plantain chips and then in case anyone wanted a little additional acidity i also put some small lime wedges and i serve these as is i don't think you need a dipping sauce but that's up to you you are after all the peter tosh of your nosh and then of course it's time for the official taste as you'll notice i'm grabbing the largest most beautiful trophy wing and that was just so unbelievably flavorful and delicious it just has an incredible balance between the salty the spicy the sweet the sour just absolutely addictive if you were looking for a new and relatively exciting hot wing recipe for your super bowl party these really were truly amazing and i really hope you give these a try so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy honey sriracha chicken wings that's right not only are you going to see a super delicious and unbelievably easy chicken wing glaze but besides that i'm also going to show you the ultimate method for doing chicken wings in the oven that come out just as crispy as the deep fried ones and yes we've done many other oven fried chicken wing recipes but this one quite frankly blows them all away and the coolest thing is we're going to do it with an ingredient you would never think in a million years would go on a chicken wing okay so let's get started and of course none of this is going to be possible without some chicken wings so i have about two and a half pounds here of fresh chicken wing sections you got your flats and you got your drums and you can usually find these already cut up like this but if you do buy the whole ones we've posted videos to show you how to break those down so i'll put a link to that somewhere and once we're all set with our wings we can move on to the spice rub which is going to start off pretty routinely with some kosher salt we're also going to add some freshly ground black pepper and then we'll add a little bit of smoked paprika so so far nothing too out of the ordinary but then to this we're gonna add two spoons of baking powder no i haven't been drinking we're gonna add in two big spoons of baking powder not baking soda baking powder and we'll give that a mix and believe it or not that baking powder is going to cause a chemical reaction on the surface of those wings that's going to very very closely mimic what happens when you deep fry them so once that's mixed up we're going to sprinkle over about half and we'll give that a little toss to coat then we will dump over the other half of the mixture give it another toss okay we want all these chicken wings perfectly and evenly coated with that mixture and once our wings have been tossed in our spice mixture we'll go ahead and transfer those onto a sheet pan and what i like to do here is put down a piece of foil and then place a baking rack right on top and then i'll transfer the wings on top of that rack and this will still work if you don't have one of those but by raising those wings up a little bit we're going to get heat convection underneath which really does help the crisping process and of course you're going to place these down thoughtfully we don't want them on top of each other we want them evenly spaced and once those have been panned up we'll go ahead and transfer those into the center of a 425 degree oven for 20 minutes at which point we'll pull them out and give them a turn and do not expect these to look good at this point in fact they look the opposite of good they look strange and scary because that baking powder the skin is going to take on a very dry kind of white powdery appearance that once saturated with the natural chicken fats in the skin is going to turn unbelievably crispy so we're going to give those a turn and we're going to put them back in for another 20 minutes at which point we'll pull them out and repeat the process and now you can see most of that dry surface has disappeared you may still see a little dry spot here and there no big deal those areas should get saturated with the fat as these cook but if you're nervous you can always dab some available chicken fat on those spots so like i said we'll flip those over and then what we'll do is we'll pop those back in for another 10-15 minutes or so until they're browned and crispy it's going to depend on the size of your wings and other variables so we'll go ahead and pop those back in to finish cooking and while we're waiting let's go ahead and mix up our honey sriracha glaze which as i mentioned is incredibly easy in fact this is so simple it's almost not a recipe so let's add some honey to a bowl and then to our honey we're basically going to add the same amount of si ra cha which is how i've been told to pronounce it three distinct syllables see rachael although you know what that sounds kind of weird i'm going back to sriracha and then besides the two main ingredients we're also going to put in a little drizzle of rice vinegar and a few drops of sesame oil just a few and we'll give that a mix and that's pretty much it so our glaze is set at this point we'll head back to the oven to grab our wings which are hopefully cooked by now so let's check it out and oh yeah those are done and you'll know because the meat will be tender and those wings will be beautifully browned and crispy like crispy for real check it out fork don't lie and by the way if you're thinking great they're crispy but it tastes like baking powder now it does not at all you would never know it was ever on there and of course i could explain scientifically how all this works you know after learning it myself but why bother who says we have to understand everything all i know is that it produces an incredibly crispy wing with absolutely no off flavor so just an incredibly cool and super effective technique and of course for our last step we're going to toss those in a bowl we will drizzle over our glaze and we'll flip those around to coat sure you can use a spatula or spoon for this part but i really prefer the old buffalo bowl flip but that's up to you you are the boss of your sauce toss and by the way look how gorgeous that sauce is that color is so beautiful looks artificial which is like the ultimate compliment and then once our formerly crispy wings are coated in that glaze we'll transfer that to a serving platter and because we used some sesame oil earlier it's completely illegal and appropriate to sprinkle a few sesame seeds on top and sure that's a garnish but mostly it's to identify these or not not your average buffalo chicken wing oh far from it so let me go in for the official taste and we'll forget about texture for a minute this glaze is so good i think it just has that perfect balance between sweet and heat and then above and beyond that magnificent taste the texture really is almost identical to what you get out of a deep fryer and by the way if you're wondering why does it matter if the wings are crisp if you're going to toss them into wet sauce anyway that's a great question but the reason the deep-fried buffalo wings are so much better is because the surface grabs on and holds the sauce alright it's almost as if the skin kind of fuses to the meat and really soaks in the sauce into all those little micro blisters whereas a baked wing has a much smoother much more slippery kind of flabby surface and it just doesn't hold on to the sauce as well okay but anyway that's it honey sriracha chicken wings every year about this time i get tons of email asking chef john of all your oven cooked chicken wing methods what would you say is the best and i never knew how to answer that because they all were about the same now i know how to answer that this is the best so i really do hope you give it a try head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] buffalo chicken wing sauce i cannot believe i haven't shown you this yet i know we've done wings before but we've never done the original buffalo style and like us folks from western new york it is a very simple thing okay so the two main ingredients are butter although according to my sources in buffalo the original recipe called for margarine don't use it so we have butter we have frank's hot sauce you can use louisiana hot sauce but frank's hot sauce is the original a few drips of tabasco or other hot sauce worcestershire sauce of course some cayenne pepper garlic powder a pinch of salt and the secret ingredient white distilled vinegar of course all the ingredients will be on the site you know they will we're going to put that over medium heat and we're going to bring that up to a simmer stirring with a whisk and that butter is going to emulsify right into that hot sauce and into the acid from the vinegar and as soon as you see a few bubbles starting to simmer on the sides turn it off give it a whisk set it aside and reserve it now you've seen me make chicken wings before so i didn't show that that'll be on the site so i have my oven fried chicken wings you can deep fry them if you want all right not really necessary you're gonna put them in a stainless steel bowl pour over some of the sauce now this much sauce will make enough for four to five pounds of chicken wings so i'd like two and three quarters pounds here so i used about a half pour the sauce over put a plate or pan on top and give it a shake that's how they do in buffalo they don't stir they shake once it's coated you can serve as is or if you want to dry them out a little bit throw them back on the sheet pan drain the oil off put it back in the oven which is still a little hot and let them sit there for about 10 minutes and the sauce kind of dries onto them a little bit either way delicious frank's hot sauce is not very spicy so if you want this to be extra spicy make sure you kick it up with some hot sauce or some cayenne and so forth anyway just a little quick and easy video on how to make buffalo style chicken wing sauce by the way this is very close to the original recipe i went to college with the cousin of a busboy that worked at the original anchor bar in buffalo said this is what was in it pretty much so i hope you give this a try all the ingredients are on the site and as always enjoy classic guacamole that's right i'm going to be showing you how to make classic traditional totally authentic guacamole or at least my version and i'm not sure exactly when you're going to watch this video but today is national guacamole day so i figured the timing was right and i know it's not a real holiday but neither was valentine's day so we're not going to let that stop us but anyway let's go ahead and get started and when you're making guacamole there's basically two components there's the avocados and there's everything else and we're going to be starting with the everything else so first up we're going to slice some serrano peppers which sort of look like small jalapeno although they are significantly hotter and yes we are going to use the seeds and everything don't be scared it's going to be fine so we will slice those kind of thin all the way down to the stem and i'm going to do three of those and then once that's set i'm going to take a nice big pinch of cilantro and give that a little bit of a chop and by the way please stop shaming your friends that don't like cilantro it's not their fault it's genetics right for 10 of the public cilantro actually tastes sort of like soap so don't force them to eat it don't make fun of them just be happy you're not one of them but anyway we're going to give that cilantro a little chop and then pile it up on top of our peppers and then we're also going to take about a third of a cup of diced white onions and add those to the pile and then we'll take our knife and give that a brief chopping and what we're basically doing here is sort of mimikine if we prep these ingredients in a mocha hete which is sort of a large stone mortar in which guacamole is traditionally made so to simulate that grinding process what we're going to do is give this a quick chop and then we'll sprinkle over some kosher salt or some other type of core salt and then we're going to proceed with what i call the old smearing chop so using the flat of our knife we're going to kind of smear that against the cutting board which again we're trying to sort of simulate the grinding action in that mochajete and it's that coarseness of the salt that kind of helps the grinding process and by grinding these ingredients we're releasing much more flavor than if we just chop this stuff up and toss it in with our avocados so this step takes a couple minutes but it's totally worth it so what we'll do is alternate between smearing and chopping until we've reached as fine a texture as we want so some people are going to leave this fairly coarse while others will prefer to grind this down to a fine paste but anyway that's up to you you are the jeff's piccoli of your guacamole but i don't go that far i like to go until it's right about here and then what we'll do once that's done is simply set that aside and move on to prepping the avocados which you probably know how to do but i'm going to show you anyway but before we get to that make sure you're buying perfect avocados all right we don't want them soft or hard we want them firm but yielding and really what it should feel like when you press is sort of like modeling clay that for me is the best description and then what we'll do to prep these is go ahead and take off that little stem thing i'll assume that's not the official name and we'll take our knife and slice in right there until we feel the knife hit that seed and then we'll simply continue cutting around and usually we don't cut towards ourselves but since that seed is stopping the knife there's very little danger and then once that's been cut all the way around we'll simply twist the halves and voila we have separation but we're not done we have to remove the seed and to do that we will carefully but firmly tap that blade on the seed embedding it about a sixteenth of an inch deep and then all we have to do is give it a twist and that seed will come right out and please do not make the rookie mistake of trying to pull the seat off the knife that is how you're going to cut yourself the safe way is put your fingers on the other side and just push it off see that so easy so safe and sure if you see any weird brown things you can go ahead and scrape those out i think that was a seed sprouting but i'm not sure but anyway once that's halved and pitted all we have left to do is take a spoon and scoop out that beautiful green flesh into a bowl and i should mention unless you're the world's slowest avocado scooper you don't have to toss this stuff in lime juice it's not going to turn brown in like five or ten minutes so some people like to squeeze in lemon or lime as they go i see no need so we'll go ahead and halve pit and scoop our avocado and i usually do four large house avocados but these were a little small so i did six and once that's set we can move into final production so to our avocados we're going to go ahead and add some more freshly chopped cilantro as well as our beautifully ground onion and serrano mixture and then we're definitely going to need to add another generous sprinkling of salt avocados are very bland unless you add salt and then last but not least we'll squeeze in some fresh lime juice or if you're super weird some lemon juice and that's it we'll go ahead and take a potato masher and mash this until it reaches our desired texture oh and i should mention a lot of people do like to throw in a handful of diced tomato into this which i like but my wife michelle is not a big fan so i guess i don't like them after all but anyway we're going to take our masher and mash this until it's as smooth or as chunky as we want personally i don't like mine too smooth i definitely want to keep a relatively chunky texture so i'm going to stop right about here which for me is perfect and then once we've determined that's been mashed to perfection we are pretty much ready to serve but you have to taste this it almost always needs another pinch of salt and quite possibly a little more acidity oh and if you're wondering about cayenne no classic guacamole does not have any cayenne in it so please do not when no one's looking sneak in a couple shakes of cayenne so anyway we're going to taste and adjust those seasonings and once that's mixed up you can go ahead and chill that in the fridge or transfer it into a nicer bowl and serve it up and i guess garner should top a little chopped cilantro which is completely unnecessary but i saw a little bit on the cutting board so i tossed it on and of course make sure you have some chips around and check it out i poured a whole bag of chips into that basket and not one single visible broken chip unbelievable but anyway that's it our classic traditional completely authentic guacamole is ready to enjoy so let me grab a chip and go in and see how i did and this stuff really is magnificent which has very little to do with us it's really the magic of the avocado okay properly seasoned there are a few things that's uniquely delicious and not to mention one of the world's healthiest foods avocado is one of the original superfoods and so healthy for you it will completely counteract the negative effects of the chips and the six pack of beer i'm gonna drink with this and while i've never had that theory verified by a medical professional it sounds right and apparently in this day and age that's really all that counts so anyway that's it guacamole like i said we're doing this to honor national guacamole day and what better way to celebrate a fake holiday than with a real great dip so i really do hope you give this a try soon head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] queso deb that's right i'm going to show you how to make a cheese dip that's better looking better for you and way way better tasting than anything you're going to get at the store and of course whether that amount of extra effort is going to be worth it is going to be up to you and will depend on factors like how much you plan on drinking but if you do decide to make your queso dip from scratch you'll want to use this very easy and virtually foolproof technique and to get started what we'll do is grate about a half pound of cheese and i usually don't film this but it's come to my attention as some of you are still using pre-grated cheese which i think is a terrible idea since it's usually of lesser quality and coated with cellulose dust so do me and your guess a favor and take the extra minute or less it takes to grate this yourself oh and in case you're wondering i'm using a nice sharp white cheddar here but any melty cheese will work and sometimes i'll go with half monterey jack and half cheddar since that's how they did it in the mexican restaurant i worked out in college so feel free to use whatever you want i mean you are after all the jesus of your quesos which by the way is a much better rhyme in english but anyway no matter what cheese we use once it's grated we're going to toss it with one tablespoon of cornstarch right just sprinkle it over and take a spoon and give it a toss and then as soon as our cheese has been successfully starched we will set that aside and we can move on to preparing the base of our dip and for that we're going to melt about a tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat to which we will add some finely minced or crushed garlic as well as some sliced green onions and i'm just using the white and lighter parts here but we will save some of the dark green parts to garnish the top layer if we want and then to our garlic and onions we will also add a nice big pinch of salt as well as a little bit of ground chipotle which as you probably know is a smoked jalapeno and we'll finish up with a little bit of cumin and then what we'll do is cook this stirring on medium-high for just two minutes okay we're not trying to brown or caramelize anything here all we're doing is taking off the raw edge so like i said we will only give that a couple minutes before adding the next two ingredients which would be a half cup of canned fire roasted chilies and i'm actually using hatch chilis here but any of your popular fire roasted canned peppers will work as would of course freshly fire roasted chilies oh yeah you get extra credit for that and then we'll also toss in some diced seeded tomatoes and we'll go ahead and give that a stir and cook this for like two minutes and by the way as you might know i'm not a huge fan of using fresh tomatoes in the middle of winter but i'm happy to report this is one of the few recipes where terrible supermarket tomatoes actually work pretty well so this time at least we can include those without any shame and then what we'll do after we've cooked our tomatoes and peppers for a couple minutes is add one can of evaporated milk which depending on the brand you use will come in lots of different colors none of which will be white right they can range from a pale yellow to a light brown but don't be concerned okay that color happens because of the way the milk is condensed which reminds me please do not accidentally use sweetened condensed milk that will not be good and what we'll do after stirring that in is wait for it to come up to a boil because once it does what we'll do is give it a stir and then carefully and confidently add our cheese and we will stir that in and the combination of our melting cheese plus that cornstarch swelling up in this hot liquid is going to thicken this mixture up and then very important as soon as our cheese is melted we want to immediately turn off the heat all right we never want to boil a cheese sauce because it will get all grainy and separated and not have a good texture so as soon as that cheese melts turn off your heat and then we'll finish this up by stirring in a nice handful of chopped cilantro if you're going to use it okay if you don't like it don't put it it's not going to bother me at all but i do like it so i'm going to stir some in and that's it at this point our queso dip is pretty much done except of course we have to taste it for seasoning which we are not going to do off a spoon or our finger all right we need to use a chip which have salt on them and by tasting this on a chip we will get a much more accurate gauge for whether we have to adjust the seasoning and i decided might need a little more salt and a little more heat so i gave it a few shakes of cayenne and gave it one final stir and that's it once that's tasted exactly how we want we'll go ahead and serve it up next to probably a whole bunch of corn chips and i hope you like how those look because those took me about 30 minutes to arrange but anyway we will serve that up and maybe top it with some more diced tomato and possibly a little scattering of green onion plus one last gratuitous shake of cayenne and that's it our queso is now ready for our faiso so let me go ahead and dip in and that my friends as you can imagine was absolutely delicious and as i mentioned earlier sure this takes a little more work but the taste and texture of this is so far superior than anything out of a jar it is not even close to the same experience oh and speaking of texture as this stuff cools down it will thicken up but only to a certain point all right one of the things i love about this recipe is even when it's fully cooled it still retains a beautiful creamy smooth texture and above and beyond avoiding like a dozen ingredients we can't spell or pronounce the beauty of making this from scratch is that you can easily tell of this to your own personal taste okay we already said you could add different cheeses but you could also add things like pickled vegetables or maybe some roasted corn or yes even a handful of nice crispy bacon but anyway that's it how i like to make queso cheese dip which if you don't speak spanish translates to cheese cheese dip but anyway whether you're gonna serve this for the big game or just any old time you're craving a delicious cheesy snack i really do hope you give this a try soon so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts of more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] buffalo chicken dip that's right all the flavor none of the bones all of the taste none of the groans and yet still an incredibly delicious snack for your game day buffet so let me show you how to put this classic baked dip together and we're going to start with chicken now most of these buffalo chicken dip recipes call for canned chicken which is really not what i want you to use at the very least go out and get yourself a rotisserie chicken just about every big supermarket in the world sells these and one small rotisserie chicken will give you just exactly the amount of chicken you need for this recipe and yes you could roast your own chicken of course but you know what you're really busy getting ready for a big party it's okay you can buy a rotisserie chicken but anyway we need some cooked chicken i'm gonna remove the skin and the bones what about cartilage yes tendons of course remove those two all right so once i have just the meat i'm gonna take a cleaver and i'm gonna cut it into kind of a small dice now you can go really fine here almost like a paste but i do like some decent sized pieces of chicken so i'm going to cut mine just like that i'm going to throw that in a bowl with a couple packages of full fat cream cheese the real stuff all right please don't use the diet cream cheese for this we only eat this once a year do you think we could just get it with the real ingredients please thank you all right next we need our hot sauce and of course we're using the authentic frank's red hot hot sauce that's the original buffalo style chicken wing hot sauce so we're gonna pour that in blue cheese dressing and crumbled blue cheese all right after our blue cheese i'm gonna throw in the closest thing i have to a secret ingredient some old bay all right and also some cayenne because frank's hot sauce is really not that hot and i definitely want this to have a lot of heat so i sell more beer i mean so my guests drink more beer and i'm also going to throw in a little bit of pepper jack cheese and we'll also save a little bit of that for the top all right get in there with your spatula or your wooden spoon and mix it until thoroughly combined by the way buffalo chicken wings go with blue cheese dressing not ranch i don't know who decided to start serving ranch dressing with chicken wings probably some idiot but it really doesn't go as well as blue cheese you want that salty sharp tang okay once all that is mixed perfectly together i'm going to transfer that into some kind of baking dish you don't need to oil it you don't need to grease it i'm using just a deep sided pie dish but this will work in any kind of standard casserole dish right so anything that's heat proof i'm gonna go ahead and smooth out the top and then before we pop it in the oven we're gonna go ahead and put on just a little more cheese all right so that's going to go in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 15-20 minutes until heated through now one little trick i like to do towards the end here i'll go ahead and flip on the top broiler for like two minutes just to brown the top a little bit all right that's optional but i like to do it and there you go our hot ready to serve baked buffalo chicken dip i'm gonna garnish with a little bit of cayenne just to sort of give people the visual warning that yes you are about to eat something that's hot be careful all right you probably want to let that cool a couple minutes before you put it out but this is fine hot this is fine warm this is good room temperature this is even good cold and of course i'm going to serve this up with some crackers and celery sticks the celery in case we have any vegans or vegetarians i don't believe they're allowed to eat crackers okay but i'm not sure but just in case we're going to have some celery sticks and that is ready to taste all right it's going to be very runny and loose when it's hot it definitely tightens up significantly as it cools all right let me get into some of this it is so good it tastes like creamy boneless buffalo chicken wings what's not awesome about that all right super bowl parties are coming up you're supposed to show up with a dish to pass and what do you usually show up with a bag of potato chips and what do your friends say behind your back dude's so lame all right so this year it's going to be different you're going to show up with this super simple inexpensive to make everybody loves it come on this is a winner like those great philosophers 69 boys once said if you ain't dippin you must be trippin and that is so true so anyway i really hope you give that a try head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts as usual and as always enjoy mini buffalo chicken egg rolls that's right finally a recipe for people that can't decide whether to make egg rolls are buffalo style chicken wings because with this new easy to make appetizer breakthrough we can kind of have both at the same time and since we are right in the middle of peak snack season the timing to share this i think is perfect so with that let's go ahead and get started and first up we need to cut up some cooked chicken and what i have here is some leftover poached chicken breasts i did to make a chicken salad and what we want to do here is cut this up somewhere between a dice and a cube and that size doesn't really have a name but sometimes i'll refer to it as dice cubes but anyway we'll go ahead and slice that across one way and then turn it and slice it across the other and i'm not going to show it all but i went ahead and did that to about eight ounces of chicken total which is roughly about a cup and a half and we'll go ahead and add that to a mixing bowl along with all of our favorite buffalo chicken wing ingredients including some diced celery as well as a couple ounces of blue cheese and please buy yourself a little wedge of the real stuff all right we don't want to be using that dry pre-crumbled stuff in the plastic container and then we'll also want to toss in a chunk of cream cheese which is not really involved in the classic buffalo chicken wing but we need a little bit here to kind of bind our filling and then we're also going to add a nice generous splash of louisiana hot sauce or the hot sauce from some other state whatever you're into and then we'll finish this by seasoning it up with some kosher salt as well as some freshly ground black pepper and because it's in season a little shake of cayenne and that is it we'll simply take a spoon and give this a mix and we will keep mixing until we're sure everything's been incorporated evenly and we're most concerned about the blue cheese okay we really do want that evenly distributed so give yourself a couple minutes until we've smeared everything together and it looks a little something like this and once that's set we are ready to move on to start filling our egg rolls and to do that of course you're going to need some square egg roll wrappers which are also sometimes sold as wonton wrappers but same thing and one tip here as we're working with those we want to keep a damp towel over the top or either paper or cloth and then the only other thing we're going to need is a little bit of an egg wash which is simply an egg beaten with a tablespoon of water and what we need to do before we start filling is go ahead and brush some of the egg wash around all the edges and you can get some in the middle like you're seeing me do here but we definitely want to make sure at least we get the edges and then once that's happened we'll go ahead and spoon out about one ounce of our filling which is basically two tablespoons also known as a heaping tablespoon and we'll go ahead and transfer that on and kind of spread it out with our fingers and then we'll go ahead and roll that bottom up over but then we're going to stop and crimp in both edges and sort of even it out a little bit before we give it one more roll and not only are we going to make sure both ends are pressed down and sealed but we also want to fold over about a quarter of an inch of that dough on either side and trust me when i tell you it's way easier than i'm making a look here all right i kept looking in the viewfinder afraid i was blocking the shot which i really wasn't but i blame that anxiety for the lack of smooth graceful movements but anyway one way or another we're going to seal those ends and fold over a little bit of dough and once that's been accomplished we'll apply a little more egg wash because that little bit of dough we just folded over from the bottom does not have any so we will apply a little bit more and then we'll simply finish this up by rolling it all the way to the edge and because we built up a little bit of extra dough along those two edges not only is none of our filling going to leak out those ends but we're not going to get a bunch of oil soaking in and once done we should have a nice neat package that looks a little something like this and what we'll want to do is we finish these is transfer them onto a plastic line tray or pan and if i'd portion my filling on all of them exactly the same as i did on the first one i would have gotten exactly 16 which is why i got exactly 14. so apparently i used a little more for the rest of them but that's fine let's just say the recipe makes between 14 and 16. but anyway once those are done we can go ahead and wrap those up until we're ready to fry or if we want we could freeze those for a future date or of course we could just go ahead and start frying right away which is what i'm going to do right now in some hot oil set over medium heat and while of course these are much easier to do in a deep fryer they still really work out quite well pan-fried like this as long as our oil comes up at least halfway we should be good and what we'll do is give those a couple minutes on each side although it looks like this side could use a little more time except that one's good must be a hot spot and to counter that we can always just reposition these and basically because our filling is already cooked all we're doing here is getting the outside as brown and crispy as possible before the stuff inside tries to escape which eventually it will if you keep them in here too long but basically i like to let these fry as long as i can before they get too dark or they start exploding and right about here i decided they had gone long enough and i transferred those onto a plate with a paper towel underneath so they could drain just a little bit sure they looked gorgeous and appeared crispy but of course as tradition dictates i grabbed a fork to make sure oh yeah and after hearing that sound i knew they were officially ready to plate up which i'm doing next to a little bit of pure louisiana hot sauce and i finished up with a little bit of celery leaf since what the heck else are we going to do with that stuff and that's it my mini buffalo chicken egg rolls were done and while that plain louisiana hot sauce might seem like kind of a boring accompaniment it really was absolutely perfect okay classic buffalo style chicken wing sauce is nothing more than hot sauce with melted butter or margarine but because of the creamy buttery goodness provided by the cream cheese and the blue cheese i didn't think i needed any in the dip and i was right but of course having said that you go ahead and serve these any way you want i mean you are after all the flipping boss of your dipping sauce but for me the plain hot sauce worked absolutely perfectly and i'm not picky i'll pretty much eat any filling stuffed in a crispy egg roll but the combination of that tender chicken and creamy cheeses which was perfectly balanced by that little bit of texture and bitterness from the celery i thought made for just a magnificent filling so basically to summarize this is everything you love about buffalo style chicken wings without the bones and without having to eat the celery blue cheese separately plus it all comes packaged in a beautiful crispy tube like delivery system and who among us does not love things delivered in tubes so i really did thoroughly enjoy these and i approved it by eating like nine of them and i'm imagining you will also probably do the same thing but there's only one way to find out for sure which is why i really do hope you give these a try soon so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts of more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] chicken nuggets that's right i've always wanted to show you my method for making chicken nuggets and with the super bowl oops sorry i mean the big game right around the corner i thought this buffalo flavored version would be just what the doctor ordered well actually the doctor ordered kale chips but you know what i mean anyway i am very excited to show you this since we are actually going to make a real nugget which is certainly not the same thing as just deep frying a little piece of chicken okay as we say in the business a nugget must be fabricated so with that let's go ahead and get started by adding some boneless skinless chicken thigh to a food processor and yes it is true that chicken breast is almost always used here but the meat from a chicken thigh tastes almost identical to a chicken wing and since that's what we're going for here that's what i'm going to use and then to that we're going to add a little bit of filler in the form of some dry bread crumbs we will of course also need some salt as well as some freshly ground black pepper and then after the pepper i'm going to sneak in a little bit of old bay which is a seasoning blend and if you're not familiar with it as usual i will explain that on the blog post i think we should also toss in a little bit of paprika as well as some of that fan favorite cayenne pepper okay so that's going to be it for our dry seasoning so now we're gonna do a little wet seasoning we're gonna drizzle in one tablespoon of hot sauce preferably frank's it's not the best hot sauce but it is traditional and then we'll finish up with the second ingredient that makes wing sauce wing sauce some melted butter although fun fact the original buffalo wing was done with margarine i know the horror so we'll do a little bit of melted butter at which point we're going to want to process this by pulsing on and off until we've achieved basically a coarse chicken paste so you know the drill just pulse it on and off on and off and right here you can get a really great look at my pulsing finger form okay you want to maintain like an 18 to 20 degree angle on that first knuckle for maximum control but anyway like i said we're going to process that until we have a coarse paste and exactly how coarse of course is up to you you are after all the d's nuts of these nuggets but let me take this top off and pull the blade out so you can see how far i went so i'm not really trying to get something that's super smooth but i really don't want a lot of big chunks in it either so that is looking pretty good and then what we'll do once our nugget base has been aced is portion it up and as you may know my favorite tool for something like this would be the sorbet scoop and if you're thinking what happens if some of those portions aren't perfectly equal well nothing actually unless they were really far off and then they may not cook at the same rate but anyway i went ahead and scooped up 24 portions in note to self next time start first row closer to the edge since i know placing that one scoop there really really bothered many of you you know who you are and then what we'll want to do once that's portioned is cover that with a little bit of plastic and then chill it thoroughly since it'll be easier to work with which you can do in the fridge if you want but to expedite things i just like to pop mine in the freezer for about 15 minutes and what we can do while we're waiting is go ahead and mix up our starch mixture which i almost call the breading but it's not all we're going to coat our nuggets with is some cornstarch into which we're going to mix some self-rising flour which is nothing more than regular flour with baking powder and salt in it and then speaking of salt we'll add a little extra pinch as you probably noticed we'll just add everything to a plastic bag which will make mixing this and coating our nuggets relatively mess free but anyway we'll make sure that's mixed thoroughly and that is now ready to coat our hopefully somewhat slightly firmer chicken mixture and no we don't want them frozen solid that's not going to work okay we just want them to firm up a little bit but still be pliable so that is perfect right there and we can go ahead and start tossing those into our flour mixture three or four at a time and i guess you could shape these as you go but for whatever reason i generally like to coat them first and then go around forming them into the shape of my choice and personally i'm going to be going with your classic nugget shape sort of oval and flattened out to about 5 8 of an inch and as long as you do sort of flatten them out to a similar thickness you can pretty much make any shape you want so if you want to do circles or squares or trapezoids feel free whatever you're into and then once our nuggets have been starched and shaped i would love to tell you they're ready to fry but they're not i mean you could but they're not going to look that good right what we really want to do is pop these in the fridge overnight so that that starch on the surface hydrates and we lose that powdery white appearance of course having said that that's not what i did all right the sun was going down and i wanted to finish the video so i decided to fry these just after a couple hours and while it looks like most of the starch is hydrated you can sort of see it still looks a little bit powdery but anyway we'll revisit that issue later for now let's just go ahead and fry these up and we are recommending our famous twice fried method and what that involves is frying these for exactly one minute at 300 degrees chilling them and then frying them a second time at 375 so that they get beautifully golden brown and crispy okay you may remember this technique from such videos as french fries and korean fried chicken so like i said we'll just do one minute at 300 at which point we will chill those in the fridge until we're ready for the second frying and by the way if you're making a whole bunch of these for future use it's after this first frying that you would store them in the freezer and that way you can just pull them out and pop them in the hot oil when you're ready to serve which by the way is exactly what they've done to the nuggets you buy at the store but anyway to recap we cook those for a minute at 300 and then chilled them at which point they are now ready to finish for just two minutes at 3.75 assuming of course yours have been flattened out to a similar size or if they're bigger it's going to take longer and i should mention just in case two-step frying procedures aren't your thing you can certainly just fry these once at 375 for about three and a half minutes but they won't be quite as gorgeous or crispy but anyway i am using the two step method and this is what might look like after the second frying at 375 for two minutes and not only do i think those look beautiful but you have to admit those do look extremely nugget-like and who said they don't look that crispy the microphone was far away but trust me they were crispy and then of course once your nuggets have been successfully fried we will serve those up with possibly some celery sticks as well as some blue cheese dressing which i've spiked with some hot sauce and yes you can toss these nuggets in buffalo wing sauce before you serve them but i prefer to dip and by combining the hot sauce and the blue cheese we're doing half the work to get both sauces in one bite but forget about the dip for a second it was fine but these nuggets really were amazing right in addition to that thin crispy coating we have a tender flavorful and very juicy interior and as i mentioned earlier because we used chicken thigh the actual taste of the meat is way closer to a chicken wing than if we'd use breast and by the way if you're using breast instead of thighs because of the fat you got to read some books that's okay now yes upon further review fat's good sugar bad but anyway i was just absolutely thrilled with how these came out except for one minor thing remember when i said we should leave these overnight so the starch has time to hydrate okay if we look very closely at this last one you see those kind of lighter dryer patches okay that's what happens if you cook these too soon and that starch is not hydrated so before we sign off let me show you some additional footage i shot the next day right they should have this sort of pink look to them and not still be white and powdery and if you do have the patience and or time management skills to do these the night before this is what they're actually supposed to look like after you fry them okay not a huge difference but definitely a little bit of a richer deeper color as well as none of those unsightly powdery spots but anyway that's it how to make your own chicken nuggets we did sort of a buffalo style wing approach here but this really is more of a techniques video and you can season these any way you want so whether you're going to make them for the big game or not i really do hope you give these a try soon so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts i have more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] million dollar dip that's right do not let the name fool you this stuff is way more affordable than it sounds and it's only called this because people think it tastes like a million dollars and usually when people say that it's mostly hyperbole but this time i think it's very accurate and appropriate since if i had to choose just one word to describe this it would be rich so with that let's go ahead and get started on what i consider this recipe secret ingredient a big handful of slivered almonds which we're going to very lightly toast in a dry pan set over medium heat and while these are technically cooked because they're blanched i think by toasting them a little bit in this pan before we add them to the dip they're going to become a little more savory and pair even better with our cheese and of course if you want to mix these around with a utensil feel free but as usual i prefer to show off and toss them in the pan and in case you're interested we have an entire video dedicated to this technique which involved a lot of cheese balls but anyway we will toss those over medium heat for a few minutes until they just start to smell like toasted almonds and maybe they start to get a little touchy golden color but not really too much and then once that happens we'll go ahead and transfer those onto a plate where we will let them cool completely before we add them to the dip and generally when you're toasting nuts like this you always want to add in one to two extra tablespoons since recent made up studies show that's the average amount people will eat as this cools so something to keep in mind and then once that's set we can move on to the only other thing we're going to cook which would be six strips of bacon that as usual we will start in a cold pan over medium heat and we really do want to take our time here and cook this crisp all right flabby bacon is not something you want in a dip and to help you do this properly i want you to remember the following famous food wishes rhyme when it starts to get foamy your bacon's almost done homie okay you see that white foam that means almost all the fat is rendered out and once cooled your bacon is going to be beautifully crisp so whenever i see that it tells me this stuff's ready to pull out of the pan and we'll go ahead and transfer that onto a paper towel line plate where we will let it cool completely before chopping it up and obviously you can go ahead and chop this up as small as you want but i'm not trying to make bacon dust all right i'm going for more like bacon bits so i'm going to stop when it looks a little something like this as the size of those pieces are looking pretty good to me except that one piece that's a little too big and that's it once our bacon's chopped we can move on to the rest of our dip ingredients which will include some mayonnaise and then to that we will add half a pound of sharp cheddar and of course we've grated that ourselves because we're not crazy and i'm actually using half orange and half white sharp cheddar here for no other reason then i like the color it provides and in case you didn't know it's literally the same cheese except that the orange is colored with a little bit of a natto seed which doesn't alter the flavor and then at this point we can go ahead and toss in our bacon as well as a whole bunch of thinly sliced green onions and do yourself a favor use a sharp knife for those the flavor will be better and i'm not kidding and then we'll also go ahead and give it a few shakes of cayenne and that's it we'll go ahead and spatulate that until well mixed and while i'm stirring this let me give you a great tip when you dump your toasted almonds on that plate to cool don't do that on a countertop on the other side of the kitchen otherwise you might not notice it and forget to put it in which of course i definitely didn't do here i'm just simulating that to make a point so i'll go ahead and stop and add those now and continue mixing and that's it once everything's been thoroughly combined it is technically ready to serve but i wouldn't okay i highly recommend we wrap this up and chill in the fridge before we serve it and of course exactly how long will be up to you i mean you are after all the one percent of how much chilling time is spent but for me i think it should chill for at least an hour and longer is probably even better and yes overnight is fine so you can make this the day before the party no problem but anyway i let mine chill for a few hours before transferring that into a serving bowl which is hopefully sitting next to a very specific type of cracker you know like the ones they serve at the fancy hotels like the ritz and normally i would say taste this for seasoning but you don't need to all right don't even waste your time it's going to be perfect but what we will do once that's transferred in is garnish the top with the scattering of green onions as well as a little more crispy bacon and that's it our million dollar dip is million dollar done and speaking of dip before we get into the taste we have to make sure this actually qualifies as a dip meaning it has to be soft enough so we can scoop some up with a cracker without it breaking which this was but just barely so it's probably not a bad idea to have some kind of knife or spreader near this so that your guests can use that because it is easier and by the end of the party you will have significantly less crumbs in this but anyway enough about the texture let's move on to the taste which really is beyond incredible i mean just a plain old cheese dipper spread is amazing but when you combine that smoky bacon and the green onions plus the extra richness those almonds provide this really is one of the most delicious and surprisingly decadent spreads or dips you will ever have which is why the name fits so perfectly i mean this truly is in every sense of the word rich oh and if you're thinking that looks a lot like neiman marcus dip well it is it's the exact same recipe which apparently at some point was rebranded but no matter what you call it if you're ready to have your taste buds taken up to the next tax bracket i really do hope you give this a try soon so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts of morpho as usual and as always enjoy sloppy dip that's right this is called sloppy dip because it's inspired by the sloppy joe and not because it's perfect to serve to people that are sloppy drunk although heavy said that this is perfect for that demographic but anyway as always we want to remind you to drink responsibly especially if you're going to be attending one of these upcoming super bowl parties which by the way this amazing hot dip would be perfect for so with that let's go ahead and get started with this incredibly simple recipe in fact it's so simple that to start we're just going to dump all our non-liquid ingredients into this pot first up we're going to need a couple pounds of relatively lean ground beef to which we will add some diced onion as well as some diced green bell pepper and then we will finish up adding our vegetation with a generous addition of minced garlic at which point we can move on to our seasonings so let's go ahead and toss in a little bit of brown sugar which of course is hopefully going to balance out our spicy and salty elements and then we will also add some freshly ground black pepper as well as a very generous shake of cayenne and as usual the exact amount is up to you you are after all the matt ryan of how much cayenne and then we are definitely going to need some kosher salt as well as a few tablespoons of all-purpose flour which is going to help add a little bit of body to our dip all right we want this to be sloppy but not necessarily messy and that's going to be it for our non-fluid ingredients and yes we really do want to add all this to a cold pot because what we're going to do next is move to the stove and place this over medium-high heat and what we're going to do is break up and stir that meat while it comes up to temperature and by starting in a cold pot i think it's a lot easier to get nice small pieces and i say small pieces but what we're really going for is more of a paste and not a whole heck of a lot's gonna happen at the beginning but as our mixture heats through that salt's gonna draw liquid out of the onions and the peppers and help us in the process of creating that meat paste we're going for made up of millions maybe billions of tiny pieces of meat and fair warning i'm editing this quite a bit this is probably going to take at least 15 minutes maybe more and by the way any kind of spatula or wooden spoon will work here but this flat edge wooden spatula really does a great job and you might be thinking oh great i don't have one of those maybe not but if you do have one too many wooden spoons and a saw you could have one but anyway we will continue to work that over on medium high until most of that moisture has evaporated and our mixture sort of dried out and browned up and resembles something like this and then what we'll do as soon as we've determined our mixture's cooked long enough is add the rest of the ingredients so first up we'll go ahead and dump in a whole bunch of ketchup or as the waiter in the hotel i stayed in italy called it american sauce which i found annoying and funny at the same time then we'll also toss in a nice big spoon of mustard i'm using dijon and then we will also do a very carefully measured spoon of worcestershire sauce i don't know why people have trouble pronouncing that it's quite easy and then we will go ahead and finish this off with a couple cups of chicken broth or water if you want and then we'll go ahead and give that a stir and then what's going to happen once those newly introduced ingredients heat through is it's going to start to simmer at which point we will set our heat to about medium and proceed to cook this stirring for approximately 45 minutes or so or until our dip reaches our desired thickness as determined by you and only you and one reason i like to add a good amount of liquid and cook it for a long time is so all those little tiny pieces of meat get really really super tender which sounds kind of funny because they're so small but i really think you can notice a difference with one that's cooked a long time like mine than one that maybe had less liquid added and only simmered for like 15 or 20 minutes so i simply let mine cook on medium for approximately 45 minutes or so until i was absolutely thrilled with how my mixture looked and then once we determined this is cooked to our ideal viscosity it is pretty much ready to serve although as is customary we will taste a little bit mostly for salt and since i'm going to serve this on sliced baguette that's what i'm going to test it on that just makes sense so i gave mine a little taste which was amazing and once we're happy with the seasoning we can move on to final assembly which i should mention we're only going to do if we're going to present this as a baked dip which i am okay if you want you could just keep that pot on low on the stove and not do anything and use it as a dip as is but it's been my experience that people drinking at parties seem to really enjoy things finished with melted cheese so i'm going to go ahead and transfer my mixture into this saucepan and then once that's set we will apply half our shredded cheese and then take a fork and give it the old polka poca and in case you're wondering i went with a sharp cheddar so we'll go ahead and kind of stir and poke that in at which point we will top with the other half of the cheese that we will not be poking in and that's it once the second half of our cheese is scattered over we are ready to finish that in a very hot oven or as i did it under a hot broiler for about five minutes or so until our top is hot and bubbling and looks something like this and by the way that's not grease on the surface that is beautiful caramelized cheese and some grease but hey anybody can make a baked dip that is unhealthy i think it should also look unhealthy and sure i guess if you want to blot the top of the paper towel go ahead but since i used grass-fed beef as you should throwing away that omega-rich fat would be like throwing away medicine but anyway enough about how it looks let's place that next to some sliced bread and go in for a taste and while i do enjoy the sloppy joe as much as any other red-blooded american i think i like this sloppy dip even better which could be the cheese but no matter what it is i just can't think of a better hot dip to serve at a party sports related or otherwise and trust me that relatively long cooking time really pays off here okay not only is this stuff super flavorful but because we did cook it for a relatively long time that meat is very soft and tender which i think is the key here oh and by the way to qualify as a world-class hot dip it must be equally delicious at all temperatures okay piping hot warm or room temp this stuff is still amazing in fact believe it or not this is even pretty good cold as i discovered recently after returning from a trip to mendocino but anyway that's it sloppy dip maybe consider taking a little bit of a break from the usual chili recipe this year since i think this would make a nice change of pace yet it's actually pretty similar so i really do hope you give this a try soon head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] boil and bake baby back ribs that's right this is going to upset some people who think it's just insanity to boil ribs and to those people i say you're probably right but anyway we'll explain all that in the blog post but for now i'm just going to show you my version which was for a hot five spice flavored baby back rib so step one here we need some flavorful liquid to boil our ribs in i'm gonna go with some cold water garlic onion bay leaves lots of red pepper flakes a good amount of salt and some chinese five spice powder all right we're gonna put that on high heat and bring that up to temperature i'm also gonna add a big giant splash of rice wine vinegar so this is almost sort of like a hot brine type thing so bring this entire mixture up to a simmer over high heat when it looks like that i want you to back the heat down so it's just simmering okay so while our five spice broth is simmering i'm gonna go ahead and prep one slab of baby back ribs which we have right here by the way i'm sure this will work with spare ribs too but i'm using the baby back all right we're going to flip it over and talk about this side for a second because some people are insane with the membrane there's like a thin membrane that runs on top of that bone side and some people have you peel that off i don't i just take my knife and run it along the back there sort of slicing up that membrane which i believe pretty much does nothing but makes me feel better all right after that we're going to slice up this rack into individual ribs it's really easy to feel where the bone and flesh is so it's very simple to go between the bones the problem is when you get to the front the side facing you right now there's like a strip of bone that's kind of tough to get through sometimes and what ends up happening is i get impatient and i just pound it and it goes right through which is fine that technique will work the problem is you're risking little bone fragments so if you can take your time and try to find the spaces between those bones so you're really not having to cut through bone if you can avoid it if you can't no problem get through it any way you can but bottom line you want to separate all those ribs and from one slab of baby back ribs you're going to get about 12 or 13 pieces all right once our ribs are sectioned we're going to go ahead and drop them into our simmering hot and spicy five spice broth and as soon as that comes back to a simmer which is just going to take a few minutes i want you to adjust the flame so you're in a nice gentle simmer and set your timer for one hour so we're gonna simmer these ribs for one hour and yes this is false advertising it's not really boiled and baked it's actually simmered and baked it just doesn't have the same alliterational excitement that boiling bake has all right while those are simmering for an hour i'm going to go ahead and prep our glaze this could be any sauce literally so my glaze is going to consist of soy sauce rice vinegar sambal chili paste dijon mustard some ketchup some honey and brown sugar and then another hit of that five spice powder all right i'm gonna whisk that up and my glaze is pretty much ready all right and like i said you can use any glaze for this so whatever your favorite sauce recipe is you could just substitute it here of course altering the flavors in your braising liquid accordingly all right one hour later our ribs are going to look like this they're definitely not going to be falling off the bone all right they're not necessarily going to be fork tender either they're just going to be ready for the next step which is you pulling them out and throwing them into your bowl of sauce you're going to want to toss those ribs i suggest the venerable spoonula for this operation of course if you want to make a big mess flip them like this and they will splash all over by the way you're going to have some extra sauce at the bottom of the mixing bowl do not throw it away we're going to use that to glaze the ribs halfway through all right once those are coated i'm going to go ahead and transfer those onto my baking sheet that i lined with a silpat those are going to go in a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes but that's only half the cooking time and after 15 minutes they really don't look like they're doing much but don't worry pull them out you're going to flip them and you're going to paint on a little extra sauce put them back in for 15 more minutes and then we got something okay so this has been a half hour they're looking pretty beautiful you can serve them like this but you know what i had a little more glaze in my bowl so i painted them one more time when it comes to glaze i'm greedy it's actually called glaze greed i have that all right so i painted some more on i put them back in for just three or four more minutes and then i piled them up and served them and they were fantastic i know many of you don't believe me because you're thinking there's no way you could boil ribs bake them and have them come out decent well before you call me an idiot you should probably try it first and for a shortcut method i think these really do have a great texture it is moist it is tender but it's not just falling right off the bone you actually have to put your teeth into it and it feels good that aromatic five spice is just under the surface really great background flavor the heat from the chili flakes and the sambal sweet and sour tang of the glaze just a great bite of rib like i said i don't expect anyone to believe this method works unless they actually try it which reminds me i hope you give this a try head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more information as usual and as always enjoy steakage the ultimate steak sandwich and why is it called steakage because we are taking a piece of steak but treating it more like a piece of sausage on the grill to make a better sandwich we're also going to show you a very cool warm mushroom salad to garnish your steakage but first let's prep our meat so i'm going to need you to go talk to a real butcher one that knows what they're doing because you need a fully trimmed flat iron steak and this works so perfectly the width is just about the same as a hot dog bun which is how we're gonna serve this so the idea here is basically cut thick strips of steak that fit on a hot dog bun instead of thin slices of steak they go on those big thick sandwich rolls so this is going to be a much better proportion and hopefully a much better steak sandwich eating experience alright this will work with other cuts as i will outline on the blog post but try to get a flat iron steak it's just so perfect for this and by the way if my meat is looking extra extra sexy it's because it's american kobe which is normally well marbled but this is just over the top gorgeous all right so after my stakage is cut i'm gonna season it generously with salt and black pepper and that is ready for the grill so i'm just gonna set that aside and move on to our grilled mushroom salad all right so i have one package of brown clamshell mushrooms i forget the real name there's a japanese name for these but anyway you find these at the nicer grocery stores very common these days and this is how they came right out of the package they're still attached at the bottom so i'm gonna leave them in kind of large pieces and i'm gonna grill those for about five or six minutes just until they start to wilt all right and get some nice grill marks a little bit of caramelization it's really gonna bring out that meaty flavor in the mushroom all right it's gonna get nice and smoky and once those mushrooms are grilled to my satisfaction i'm gonna bring those inside throw them on a cutting board and before i dress them i'm just gonna take a knife and cut off the bottom where all those stems meet see that now you could chop that and use it i just discard it i'm not sure why all right so once all the mushrooms are separated i'm gonna toss those in a bowl with some salt and pepper some sherry vinegar and some extra virgin olive oil and that's it so this is really super basic and simple but it's really gonna make a great garnish for our steakage sandwich all right so that's ready i'm gonna set that aside all right we're gonna head out back to the grill which is still nice and hot and we're gonna grill our pieces of steakage so again you can see the key here is you want something that's as wide as it is thick i think the fatal flaw of most steak sandwiches is too much bread and not enough meat because the steak is usually cut from like a new york strip and it's too thin and wide here like a piece of sausage we're working with a much thicker more uniform shaped piece of meat so not only is the shape superior because it lets us serve it on a hot dog roll where the star is really going to be the meat not the bread but also allows for a juicier easier to cook piece of meat so after three or four minutes per side mine were pretty much perfect medium rare i pulled them off even though they're small pieces i still let it rest for a couple minutes while i dressed my bun which i suggest you do as follows nice soft hot dog bun you could toast it lots of mayonnaise you're gonna need a little bit of bitter greens some arugula maybe not too much some quartered cherry tomatoes all right when it's not summer that's always your best and sweetest option all right then we're going to put a nice big spoon of our warm grilled mushroom salad and to finish off a very simple barbecue vinaigrette and i'm gonna have that recipe on the blog it's just a little bit of barbecue sauce thinned out with some oil and vinegar makes a great dressing to this steak sandwich and there you go what i'm calling the steakage the ultimate steak sandwich and to be all authentic i filmed this outside and it was really overcast and light was not good but anyway you can still see it was beautifully pink juicy and just i think a really great alternative way to present a steak sandwich off the grill anyway i hope you give that a try hot dogs and hamburgers are fine for the regular season but when it gets close to the playoffs in the super bowl you want something a little more special so head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts as usual and as always enjoy [Music] fried mozzarella puffs that's right people love bumpy food especially when it's also crispy and produced by frying cheese which is exactly what we have here as i'm attempting to update and sophisticate the good old-fashioned fried mozzarella stick and not only are these tastier more interesting and more fun to eat they're also much easier and don't require any breading so with that let's go ahead and get started by making a very very simple pastry dough which we'll start by adding a little bit of butter to this pan along with some cold fresh water and what looks like a lot of salt but it's not since we're going to be working with mozzarella which tends to be a little bit bland and what we're going to do here is set our heat to medium high and as soon as the water starts to simmer and that butter melts or almost melts we'll go ahead and dump in our flour all at once reduce our heat to medium and stir that in with a small spatula or wooden spoon freakishly small or otherwise and it's not going to look like things are going well when you first start but don't worry just keep mixing and stirring and smearing and eventually all the flour and lumps are going to disappear and it will all eventually pull together and smooth out at which point all we have to do is cook a stirring for about two or three minutes and as we do this that dough is going to kind of want to stick to the bottom but because of the moisture in the dough as we kind of stir and scrape it's also going to not want to stick to the bottom okay so basically the dough doesn't know what it wants to do but anyway like i said we will cook that for two or three minutes scraping and rubbing that pan as clean as we can and then what we'll do once that's been accomplished is quickly remove that from the heat and transfer it into a mixing bowl where we will let it cool for about five to ten minutes and to help that process it's always a good idea to kind of spread it out and really all we're waiting for is for this mixture to go from very very hot to just very warm which if i had to guess is going to take between 5 and 10 minutes and then what we'll do once this is cooled a bit is season it up with some freshly ground black pepper along with the obligatory shaker cayenne and then we will add one large egg from a distance of about three feet so that the yolk breaks when it hits and by the way that last instruction actually serves no practical purpose it's just something fun to do and then to finish this what we'll do is take a whisk and mix this until it all comes together to form a very soft very very sticky dough and fair warning when you first start doing this it's going to look like something went tragically and horribly wrong but don't worry just keep mixing and eventually it will all come together literally come all together as in it will all come together stuck inside your whisk and that's how you're going to know it's done and then once that happens we'll take a spatula and clean off our whisk into the bowl which is by far the hardest part of this whole recipe and it is a lot faster if you kind of bang the whisk on the bowl but then you'll probably have little pieces of dough stuck to your wall and ceiling so i'm just going to go with the spatula so we will clean off our whisk and then give that one last mix with the spatula to make sure everything's beautifully smooth and then what's going to happen next once we have that all together in one lump and we've scraped down the sides of our bowl the best we can is we're going to cover this in plastic and refrigerate it for about an hour before we add our cheese which is why we'll wrap it with the spatula and while that's chilling we can go ahead and make our marinara sauce dip which is simply going to be some prepared marinara sauce that we will accessorize with the following ingredients some dry oregano some red pepper flakes if you want it spicy which we do we will also do a little splash of balsamic vinegar and then last but not least one anchovy fillet or as we call it around the office italian msg and then what we'll do is go ahead and give this a stir and we will bring this up to a simmer on medium heat and that is pretty much going to be it other than giving it a stir or two we'll just let that simmer for about 10 minutes and then we can turn it off and just keep it in a warm spot until we're ready to use it and it is kind of nice if the sauce is served warm but room temperature is totally fine okay so our sauce is done and then assuming our dough is chilled we'll go ahead and pull that out and we will finish this off by grating in a relatively large amount of low moisture mozzarella cheese also known as not the good mozzarella cheese okay for this recipe to work we really have to use the firmer drier stuff which means that beautiful fresh creamy mozzarella is not going to work here and by not working exploding the oil so this time we're going to let you buy the cheap stuff and for heaven's sake grate it yourself okay cellulose dust is not on the ingredient list so we'll go ahead and grate that in and give it a mix with a spatula and what's kind of funny here is we're adding so much cheese this recipe actually shouldn't work but somehow it does and then once we're sure that's been mixed in and distributed evenly we'll scrape our spatula down with a spoon and then grab a second spoon since that's how i like to get this dough into the oil okay so we'll take some with one spoon and then if we want we can kind of shape it with the other into sort of an oval shape which by the way is completely optional since it's been my experience no matter how carefully you shape these they all kind of look the same once they're fried which i will prove later and then what we'll do once we have the amount and shape we want just carefully transfer that into some 350 degree oil which by the way mine wasn't i was impatient and it probably was just over 300 and the problem with that especially if you're trying to get away with just a couple inches of oil is that it can and will stick to the bottom although it usually will release easily with a little nudge but anyway what we'll do is fry that for about two or three minutes or until brown and crispy and for this test i'm just doing one but you can easily do four or five or six at a time and other than going by the appearance one way you can tell these are done is that you'll see little tiny pieces of mozzarella poking up through the surface which i was trying to show you by flipping this over but it wasn't working okay you're gonna kind of see it here as i lift it out and that's it we'll just drain that for a minute on a napkin or paper towel at which point it's ready to enjoy and if these are still hot or even warm when you break it in half and pull it apart you're going to get that super sexy string cheese effect which everybody loves especially the kids and crispy texture and stretchy visuals aside these things taste like a beautifully creamy hunk of warm melty mozzarella cheese so other than the oil temp that was my very successful test and i proceeded to fry four more intentionally not spending any time shaping them okay i'm pretty much just scooping some of the dough and pushing it off with the other spoon and other than making sure your oil is at the right temp the other thing to be careful of is not to drop these on top of each other okay after a few seconds that surface will seal and you'll be fine but when you drop another one in make sure there's not one right under it and like i said earlier we'll fry these for about two to three minutes and of course the exact time is going to depend on how much dough you spooned in so you'll have to observe and adjust i mean you guys are after all the jimmy g's of how long to fry your cheese but about three minutes is a good guess or just fry them until they look a little something like this and of course as the one frying any little random bits of rogue dough that fall into the oil you are allowed to eat micro puff and as you can hopefully see even if you don't shape these they still come out looking quite nice and very very enticing although for comparison purposes i did fry four more after these taking the time to shape them as carefully as possible and while they do maybe look a little more uniform those four in the front do not look that much differently than those four in the back we fried before these so the point is do not stress trying to get these perfect going into the oil and then because this is an italian-american appetizer we are required by law to garnish with a little bit of parsley and that's it these are now ready to officially enjoy which i would have loved to do right away so the cheese was still stretchy but i didn't i took way too many pictures so these cooled down and i didn't get the sexy cheese stretch but that's fine even at room temp these are still amazing especially dipped in that extra flavorful slightly spicy sauce and even though my brain knew these weren't stretchy my fingers did not get the message so i kept trying to pull it apart to stretch it but even though these weren't visually stretchy the insides are still beautifully creamy and they really do taste like you're eating a piece of crispy fresh mozzarella cheese although somehow unlike eating a chunk of fried mozzarella thanks to our french pastry these are actually very very light in texture hence the name puff oh and i should mention if you're doing a large amount you can reserve the ones you fried in a warm oven and they hold beautifully so something to keep in mind but anyway that's it what we're calling fried mozzarella puffs if you like fried mozzarella sticks but don't enjoy all that messy breading and associated gunked up fingers you are absolutely gonna love these which is why i really do hope you give them a try soon so please follow the links below for all the ingredient amounts a printable written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy kentucky beer cheese that's right and while i've never actually been to kentucky i have been to beer and cheese many many times and if you're a fan of the beer and cheese like i am you're going to enjoy this unique and super easy to make cheese spread so let me show you how to put this together and the first thing you're going to need is one large cheap domestic beer and as you can see i got the 24 ounce size even though i only need one cup which means that leaves 16 ounces for me see kids that's why i want you to pay attention to math in school but anyway we're going to pop the top we're going to pour that in a bowl because we want a flat beer all right we don't want any carbonation oh and by the way you're going to want to do this step ahead and down in kentucky they would just leave an open beer overnight to get stale but here we can expedite things by putting it in a bowl and giving it a little whisk and that stuff will go stale very quickly and eventually what you're looking for is this no bubbles and that beer has been properly prepped and then once our beer's been flattened it's time to grate our cheese and right here i have one pound of extra sharp cheddar i'm going with the orange variety as i think it looks more authentic and we're going to go ahead and grate that right into the bowl of our food processor and i do prefer gradient to cubing which a lot of these recipes call for people just cut up the cheese in big chunks and blend it that way but i really think the texture is better if you grate the cheese beforehand so sure it does take a couple extra minutes but i didn't care i was drinking the extra 16 ounces of beer so that worked out nicely and then after we've grated our cheese we're going to go ahead and spice this up all these ingredients by the way are mandatory first up we're going to need a couple cloves of crushed garlic you want that crushed your mince very very fine we're also going to want some dry mustard some freshly ground black pepper a whole lot of cayenne pepper a pinch of salt we're also going to give it a few dashes of louisiana hot sauce or kentucky hot sauce if you have it and then a few drops of worcestershire sauce and then last but not least we're going to pour in about a cup of stale beer and of course you can vary the amounts of that depending on the texture you want here and then once that's set all we're going to do is process this until it's very smooth and creamy and like most of these operations will pulse to start just get it going once it looks like it's getting smooth we'll stop we'll scrape it down with a spatula that's looking good it's a good start but we need to blend it much smoother so we'll scrape that down put the lid back on and we'll simply continue until it's very very smooth and of course this is edited for time so it's going to take a couple minutes a lot longer than it looks like here but just keep blending until you have something that looks like this and then of course because i've trained you properly you're going to taste some and you're going to adjust does it need more anything alright you might wanna spice yours up a little more you might wanna put another pinch of salt or pepper up to you you are the judge dread of your spread now we are gonna recommend that you refrigerate this overnight to let the flavors develop but you can serve this right away it's perfectly fine and i just serve mine simply in a glass bowl with a little bit of extra cayenne and of course they just serve the celery and carrots down there for color nobody ever eats them but you're gonna want to put those on there anyway for appearances but anyway no matter how you serve this you are in for a truly unique regional american snack oh by the way it's worth noting that even though the texture might look grainy from a distance it's actually very smooth and creamy alright so don't let that fool you and as i bite this i gotta tell you there's good news and bad news the bad news is this is definitely an acquired taste the good news is it only takes like three bites to acquire it and i think the reason is if you've never had this before that first bite really does taste kind of like sharp cheddar and skunky stale beer but by the third fourth fifth bite you are totally addicted and loving this delicious spread oh by the way before i sign off here i have to point out that wooden table you see me serving this on is actually made from reclaimed wood from the zigzag paper factory in kentucky true story but anyway if you're looking for something a little unique for your super bowl party or just want something a little more interesting the next time you entertain i really hope you give this kentucky beer cheese a try soon head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy;['primeros']
MhODfYtSh6U.json;hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete back here in Boca Grande on the Gulf side of Florida one of my favorite beaches and what a special day it is today I got my buddy Gus here hi folks Gus and I started the fire hall together back in 1987 we always loved to cook and hang out we've been buddies ever since and it's a real treat here to have them today because today the star of the show is oysters three different ways we've done a little bit of research Gus what can you tell me about the oysters we're using we got today are called see they're from Cedar Key which is on the gulf side of florida up in the northern part of florida up near the panhandle and they're a very briny oyster we toss them the other day and they were delicious I'm looking forward to trying some today all right well first maybe you could describe to us how we're gonna shuck well sit down here and we'll open up a few and you can walk us through it you happy to do that sounds good all right we've got one of our Cedar Key oysters we picked up from our local fishmonger here in the area most important tool is your shucking knife it's important to have a good firm blade some of them are flimsy this one has a guard on it which is added protection and you'll see on Easter's as they come up to the tip here you'll find a purchase point you can see where the top and the bottom shell meet together so I like to use a thick towel put that over top of the oyster and you give it your shucking knife in there and you start to work it in or get in and the top should just pop right off you run your shucking knife along the top of the oyster and remove the top piece of the top of the shelf you get inside here and you have to remove the oyster from the muscle and that's freed up and then you're free to add your favorite ingredients to it whether it's hot sauce lemon juice horseradish or maybe you just like to go at raw and you can just slide that right in your mouth well Gus great job shucking those oysters thanks Pete you know before we enjoy these I'd like to give a little shout-out to our pals back at the Burlington fire department hopefully everybody's well working safely and

better known as a stick and then we're gonna have some finely diced onions here I'm gonna throw in a couple of tablespoons this is just a teaspoon that I measure this so there's a couple of tablespoons in there and we're gonna add some fresh lime about a half of a lime the juice from half of a lime lots of good flavors here I think the lemon and the butter the onions just work so well together now here's an interesting item I have here I have some smoked turkey sausage and what I've done is they sauteed it up quickly in a cast-iron pan and two little finely diced pieces so we'll sprinkle that around in our sauce that will absorb all these flavors and then last but not least we're gonna add some hot sauce and again this is your choice put as much as you want in it I'm putting quite a bit in this this is almost like what you would do if you're doing a buffalo chicken sauce but even amounts of butter even amounts of hot sauce and again to your taste try it out see what you

butter grilled oysters it's kind of a two-stage process we're gonna start off with a little bit of butter it's gonna help mix the next few ingredients together we've got some finely diced shallots we're gonna put in all about two tablespoons this is just a teaspoon I'm using so but four of those should be about two tablespoons and next we've got our thick-cut double smoked bacon I've already sautéed this up and then cut it into little tiny pieces like bacon bits so we'll let all those flavors mix nicely together then what we're gonna do is we want to place that on top of our raw oyster

n_g2hJDI2Ys.json;hey lovelies so you know fall is here cuz the weather is getting a little cooler the leaves are starting to change color and I am wearing plaid and that can only mean one thing it is time for some comforting soup recipes today I've got three creamy comfort soup recipes that are really really tasty and all pretty easy to make so there is a lot to love just before we get to our tasty soups I want to remind you that all month long we are offering 50% off our 12 week specialty meal plan bundle over unhealthy meal plans calm these meal plans were created by our in-house dietician to be nutritionally balanced they've got a ton of great variety and the best part is they can be fully customized to suit your personal tastes so of course there is a lot to love all the details are linked in the description box below you can use the promo code eat well to access your discount now without further ado let's get to some creamy comforting soups starting with this amazing rustic white bean soup as always I am working in my nice big soup pot on the stove if you don't have a soup pot like this might I recommend you invest in one it's one of the best kitchen spends you will ever make I have linked a couple of my favorites in the description box as well if you're looking for one I've got my soup pot heating up over medium-high heat and I'm going to start by browning up some bacon now if you didn't want to use pork in this recipe you could use some chicken here instead but obviously bacon lends a ton of great flavor to this recipe I'm going to cook my bacon just until it starts to crisp up and then I'm going to add the trifecta of amazing soup ingredients some onion celery and carrots these are all total classics when it comes to soup I'm going to cook those just until they start to soften so maybe three to four minutes and as soon as they start to soften up and that celery turns bright green we can go ahead and add some garlic to the pot as well once that garlic hits the pan your kitchen is going to start smelling even more amazing if that's possible and that means it is time to get a little white wine in here now if you want to skip this step you definitely can you don't have to use the white wine but it adds a ton of beautiful flavor and then I'm just gonna let that simmer away for two to three minutes that gives it time the alcohol to evaporate and all you'll be left with is this amazing flavor at this point it's time to add our beans to the pot these are cannellini beans or white kidney beans I'm using canned beans that I've drained and rinsed once those are in there we can add our chicken broth to the pot as well as a nice splash of cream or even more great flavor in this recipe I'm using some rosemary some thyme and a bay leaf in addition to those amazing herbs we are going to be amplifying the flavor factor by the power of 10 using a parmesan rind so if you've never used one of these in your cooking you were in for a total treat basically when you buy a piece of parmesan you grate it until all that's left is the Ryann and what I do is I hold on to these keep them in a zipper bag in my refrigerator and when I'm making a soup like this I pop the rhein right into the soup and it imparts the most amazing savory cheesy flavor into whatever you're making the next step is just bringing this mixture to a boil and once it's reached a boil we can go ahead and pop a lid on our pot reduce our heat to medium-low and let this just simmer away for say 15 to 20 minutes it doesn't take very long for this to get really really super flavorful so what I like to do is just use a slotted spoon to sort of lift out our sprigs of thyme and our bay leaf they have done all the work we need them to do which is lovely and then you have the option to serve it really chunky and rustic like this or to use an immersion blender like this to get it a little smoother when you're working with an immersion blender you want to make sure that your heat is totally off and that you have it fully submerged at all time otherwise you can get dangerous flash ups I'm doing a bit of a 1/2 puree here so I want it to be nice and thick and creamy and texture but I also want to leave some of those ingredients intact at this point we can finish the soup off with another helping of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and some freshly chopped parsley what is not to love about this soup guys I like serving it up with a little bit of fresh parsley and a nice side of crusty French bread for all you mushroom lovers out there have I got the soup for you this is a creamy garlic mushroom soup it's essentially a classic cream of mushroom soup except with a really garlicky kick I've got my soup pot heating up on the stove and of course to that I am going to add some butter as soon as that butter is melted I am going to load in my mushrooms now you'll see it looks like we have a lot of mushrooms happening here but as you know mushrooms lose a ton of their volume while they're cooking so a lot becomes a little pretty quickly I'm using a combination today of some cremini mushrooms that I've done they sliced as well as some shitake mushrooms I like the combination of mushrooms here but if you only wanted to use creaminess or white button mushrooms in this recipe that definitely works once those mushrooms hit the pot we'll season them up with a little salt and a little pepper and then we'll let them cook down for between five and six minutes stirring them frequently and tell they start to brown and release a lot of their moisture and then it's time to add our garlic now I'm using three cloves of garlic in this recipe that is a lot of garlic so if you want to dial it back a bit you can but it's creamy garlic mushroom soup so feel like you need the garlic we're gonna let that garlic heat up for maybe thirty Seconds to a minute and then it's time to add a little flour to the pot the flour is going to help our soup thicken up while it cooks but it's important to cook off that floury taste first so I'm going to cook my flour for maybe a minute or two while stirring it constantly so that it doesn't burn next I'm gonna go ahead and add my mushroom broth to the pot if you have trouble finding mushroom broth where you are you can swap in some chicken or beef broth here as well both will work but of course mushroom broth has a really great mushroom flavor speaking of flavor I've got two more ingredient additions that will add just that a little splash of soy sauce is headed into this soup as well as some fresh thyme we'll go in and get the sprigs out afterwards but in the meantime hahaha time they are going to impart a ton of beautiful flavor I'm also going to add a good helping of cream to this now you could do this with milk but we are talking about a fall comfort food cooking just use the cream enjoy the cream I'm just going to bring this mixture to a boil and as soon as it reached a boil I will reduce my heat to low and let it simmer for maybe 10 minutes or so that's really all it takes now you have a couple options you can serve the soup chunky just as it is but I actually like to give it a quick to help it get nice and thick and rich but I also want to preserve some of that great texture of the mushrooms so what I like to do is just use a slotted spoon to sort of lift out a good helping of the mushrooms and we're gonna add them back in once we smooth everything out as far as an easy weeknight soup option this one really can't be beat you can prepare the entire thing in under 20 minutes on the stove finally guys when a chill hits the air nothing will warm you up quite like this amazing sausage kale and gnocchi soup and you're not gonna believe how easy it is to make it starts once again of course with a soup pot on the stove and just heating up a little bit of oil once our oil is nice and hot we can get some sausage into the pot I am using some mild Italian sausage you have the option to use hot italian sausage if you wanted to what's cool is that the sausage itself has so much flavoring that you don't need to add very much to it to make it delicious now I have removed the sausage from its casing and I'm just gonna use my spoon to break it up while it's cooking I want to get it into a little bit as soon as that sausage is cooked we're gonna add some onion to the pot we'll let that cook for another 2 to 3 minutes next we're gonna go ahead and add some garlic to the pan and I'm also going to add some red chili flakes here now these are totally optional if you are not in to the heat you leave the red chili flakes out next I'll go ahead and add some chicken broth to my pot as well as a splash of cream we'll bring this mixture to a simmer reduce our heat to medium and then we're going to get our gnocchi into the pot so no key is basically a potato based pasta you can usually find it fresh in the deli aisle at your supermarket or frozen in the freezer section it's really pillowy and delicious and the cool part about gnocchi if you're not familiar with cooking with it is when it's ready which only usually takes 2 or 3 minutes it's going to rise to the top of your pot and as soon as you see the gnocchi start rising that's how you know it is time to add your kale which is only going to require a few minutes to well down you could also use spinach if you wanted to that would work definitely in this recipe as well then I'm gonna hit this with a little salt and a little pepper and guys you will have a soup that you absolutely love I have to tell you this become my husband's new favorite I hope you'll give all three of these yummy recipes a try if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because I love

OcvshAvu9Rk.json;hi lovelies our cozy fall soup series continues today with one of my very favorite hearty and satisfying recipes it's pasta fagioli soup now if you have never had the pleasure of trying this soup for yourself you are in for such a treat it's nutrient-rich full of fiber and filling thanks to the addition of both pasta and beans in fact pasta fagioli is basically a direct translation for pasta and beans which is the base of this soup and it's actually really really simple to prepare so to get started i have got a little bit of olive oil heating up over medium-high heat in a nice big soup pot on the stove now if you don't have one of these already i highly recommend investing in one it's one of the kitchen tools that i use the most year after year and you don't have to splurge for a super expensive one you can get one for under fifty dollars like this one was and i'm gonna get started by browning my ground beef once that beef is in the pot i'm going to go ahead and break it up into little bits using the side of my spoon and i want to season it liberally with a little salt and a little pepper i've opted for some extra lean ground beef here and that's always a good idea in a soup like this because you don't want a lot of extra fat floating around in your soup this is a really good place to use as lean a beef as you can find now if you don't want to use meat in this recipe you definitely have the option to leave it out i've also seen this made with italian sausage you could use hot or mild both would be really really tasty you could also lighten this up a little bit by using some ground poultry instead so some turkey or some chicken if you wanted to or you also have the option to just leave the meat out entirely and keep this vegetarian totally up to you just as soon as that beef is nice and brown we're gonna go ahead and start building in our flavor here and to do that i'm starting with a traditional mirepoix that's what they call this classic mixture of onion celery and carrots tons of great flavor plus tons of great nutrients as well and we just want to let these cook up for another say three to four minutes or until they're nice and soft then it's time to add even more great flavor to this and i'm going to be doing that courtesy of some garlic now i think i mentioned this in my last video but it's worth mentioning again we have been plagued by cold season in our house my daughter ella is in daycare and so we basically pick up everything that's going around the daycare and needless to say everyone has been sick pretty much consistently for a month so soup has been our savior i always like to add tons of garlic to my soup because garlic has lots of immunity boosting power and that is something we could really use around our house right now i also want to get in here with even more great flavor and to do that i'm going to be adding an italian seasoning that's loaded with dried herbs like thyme oregano parsley and basil you can use homemade or store-bought both work really well in this recipe and i'll just let that seasoning heat up for another minute or so to help it really maximize its flavor mmm you won't believe how good this already smells super soothing to the soul then it's time to go ahead and add my beans to the pot in this case i'm using a combination of cannellini beans also known as white kidney beans as well as some red kidney beans but to be perfectly honest you can use whatever canned beans you have lying around in your pantry i always have canned beans on hand because of course they're loaded with fiber great for you and require almost no cooking at all what's not to love about that once my beans are in the pot i'm gonna go ahead and add my tomatoes as well so i've got some crushed tomatoes headed in here as well as some diced tomatoes because i like the two different textures happening i'm also going to be adding some beef broth to my pot now you can really use any kind of broth you want in this recipe i'm opting for beef because of course it works really well with the ground beef that we're using here but if you were using italian sausage or some ground poultry you could use chicken broth or some veggie broth if you wanted to leave this vegetarian definitely up to you next i'm gonna go ahead and add my secret ingredient which i really believe takes this soup right over the top in terms of flavor and my secret ingredient is actually a parmesan rind now if you don't know what this is it's basically the piece that's left over once you've grated your full piece of parmesan and usually people throw them away but what i like to do is actually save them in a zipper bag and store them in either my fridge or my freezer and then whenever i'm making a nice savory soup like this i just pop the whole rind right into the soup and it imparts the most beautiful umami flavor into the soup you won't even believe how delicious it becomes now at this point i'm just going to let this come to a nice rolling boil and once it's reached that boil i want to go ahead and add my pasta to this and here i'm using traditional detali pasta that's super classic in this soup super classic in this soup super classic but you can really use any kind of small pasta you wanted to you could use some macaroni some mini shells or even some orzo if that's what you have on hand and basically what we're going to do is let those shells cook away in that delicious broth until they're nice and tender that usually takes between say 10 and 12 minutes now some people would tell you to cook your shells in a separate pot and then add them to your soup but i just add an extra cup or two of broth to compensate for the fact that my shells are going to absorb a lot of that liquid and that way i don't have to dirty any more dishes because guys let's be honest i have two kids i've already got plenty of dishes to do so while that pasta is boiling and bubbling away i'm going to go ahead and add my second secret ingredient and that is just a little bit of sugar so i've got about two teaspoons here and i'm going to sprinkle it into my pot i know this seems totally counter-intuitive in a savory recipe like this but that sugar is just going to help cut the acidity of those tomatoes just a little bit you're not even going to be able to detect it it's not going to make your soup sweet or anything but it's going to mellow out that acidity quite a bit so i highly recommend adding it to your pot and just as soon as that pasta is fully cooked this soup is ready to be enjoyed i like going in and removing my parmesan rind because of course it's done all its hard work and honestly it is ready for serving i like finishing it off with some freshly chopped parsley just for a bit of green and freshness as well as some freshly grated parmesan cheese because honestly guys what is not made better with freshly grated parmesan am i right some people call this a soup i think it eats a lot more like a stew regardless it is one of the most delicious things you will eat this fall i promise you that in fact i'm ready to have a bowl right now this soup is so hearty flavorful and satisfying it totally eats like a meal it's the perfect thing on a chili fall day the flavor is so good your entire family is sure to love it and i hope you will give it a try for yourselves if you do be sure to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because you know how much i love seeing your kitchen creations remember this recipe like all of my recipes is featured on

oKEreVuTDfE.json;[Music] that's good it's really good [Music] hello friends and welcome back to my kitchen so today we are going to make some easy and delicious biscuit dough recipes i actually saw a recipe over on instagram using biscuit dough and i was like wow that looks incredible so i wanted to make that one and then that got me started like looking at different recipes using biscuit dough and there were so many good ones so i was like let's just do an entire video only using biscuit dough and honestly there are just so many variations of things that you can make with this one ingredient and whether it's like for breakfast an appetizer or like a full-blown meal or dinner there's so many great recipes so if you have one leave me a comment down below and tell me what it is i would love to try it but without further ado let's go ahead and get cooking okay so the ingredients for this first one of course you're gonna need the biscuit dough you're also gonna need some string cheese i bet you can see where this is going and then we're gonna melt a little bit of butter add some garlic you can add like um parsley or basil kind of whatever you have on hand and i'm also to add a little bit of italian seasoning to that as well we'll brush it on top of our like cheesy biscuit bombs and then you can actually dip these into marinara once they're done y'all mr b is going to love these okay so first thing i'm going to do is go ahead and preheat my oven to 425 and then next i'm going to take each individual biscuit and just kind of roll it out until it's flattened okay and one more tip i actually got the flaky layer biscuits so like this one i just kind of pulled apart that way there's not too much bread to cheese consistency if you want to leave the biscuit just as is you can but i think it'll be better kind of a little bit thinner biscuit consistency [Music] okay so now that we have our biscuits prepared i'm gonna go ahead and take our string cheese and i'll probably be able to cut this into like three or four pieces and then we'll just put three little bite size pieces in the center of each biscuit [Music] but now we're just going to take our biscuit dough and kind of bring it up over top of that cheese and form like a cheesy little biscuit balm keep all that goodness inside there just like that [Music] okay if you've watched the past couple videos i'm gonna let y'all like laugh with me because we still have not gone to get a microwave we ended up going and staying at the camper this weekend at ocean lakes for like funky's birthday and valentine's day like a little weekend getaway but that means we did not go get a new microwave and i was like hang on i can't just throw this butter in here to melt it and then earlier today bunkie was trying to make lunch and he couldn't heat up his lunch and i was like oh my gosh we have seriously got to go get one so i'm going first thing tomorrow to do that i'm just going to throw it in a little saucepan on the stovetop melted that way and then we can throw our other ingredients in there i'm gonna do just one kind of little crack of salt over these two because i think that'll be really good and then these are going to go into the oven for just about 15 minutes okay i present to you some goodness that you're gonna love and i gotta tell you something hilarious oh that's a nice herb herbie okay listen babe i was gonna um heat you up some marinara to like dip them in we don't have a microwave but then listen the struggle is real but then i was gonna just put it in my little sauce pan where i melted the butter i realized we have no marinara so just envision in order to taste test this properly you have to hold one and pull it apart okay so get whichever one you want look at this one here okay and then you gotta just pull apart oh bonkey look oh wow you're not as excited about the cheesy pool as i am oh no well [Music] that's good it's really good mm-hmm that little topping you got on there it's magic was expecting a lot of biscuity taste here right very very much not biscuity you know why because these were like the flaky layered biscuits and so i pulled them in half so it's like less yes that was going to be a suggestion i was going to make yeah genius right yeah but if i had some dipping sauce with these two and we were hang on these are like almost like those um cheesy bites we're gonna battle their night at mellow mushroom yeah but actually there's a thousand times better we can get a direction these are like um i mean it's almost like garlic knots with what's mozzarella stuffed yeah you know and they're so simple it took 15 minutes ma'am i sent you a text message a little bit ago i haven't seen it did you get it no i i recommended bucky if you were feeling a little bit crazy uh-huh you could add some pepperonis in here for me oh for sure yeah that would be like a great little lunch or an appetizer i know so i thought of something else okay are you ready yeah because these are made with biscuits uh-huh i thought of a name for them oh tell me are you ready i'm ready now this was that only after i thought about the pepperoni okay addition of pepperoni but you can put pretty much any ingredients oh yeah that's for sure southern pizza poppers bonky boom this is what i'm talking about that's a great name right yeah i don't know what kind of this is incredible these are so good back there you know sometimes i gotta try one let me give it let me tell you this i think it's the garlic is that fresh garlic you chopped no it's all the jar oh well anyway it's really good mmm those are so good wow okay this is absolutely delicious i'll have to try them so simple finger looking good okay friends i'm gonna meet y'all back in the kitchen tomorrow morning because we're gonna make a little breakfast casserole using the biscuit dough and y'all know i'm like the biggest breakfast fan ever so i'm so excited for that and then after breakfast we have

for up to 16 free meals and three surprise gifts okay good morning i got my coffee i am so excited for this breakfast i have my stuff laid out here behind me but i want to tell you guys i was actually editing this video earlier this morning and i realized that my camera something happened i don't know whenever i pulled those little cheesy bombs what if i could call them southern pizza bombs i don't know out of the oven yesterday um so i don't have that footage but i wanted to say once you pull them out you're going to take the remaining of your like buttery herb goodness and brush them again y'all they were delicious like one of our favorite little things we've made in a long time so y'all definitely have to try those but anyway let's go ahead and get started on this breakfast casserole okay so the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and preheat our oven to 350 degrees and then i'm gonna go ahead and fry some bacon okay so i'm kind of having this recipe so i'm only gonna use about five slices of bacon but i am gonna go ahead and kind of cut it up into bite-sized pieces since we're gonna have to chop it up and put it in the casserole anyway [Music] okay so now the hard part is not to eat all of your bacon before you make the casserole so i'm gonna put it over here and try not to eat any of it and then to my bowl i'm going to go ahead i'm going to use about five eggs because like i told you guys i'm not doing a full blown recipe this is just for bunkie and i and i'm going to whisk those together with a little bit of milk salt and pepper [Music] okay so once you have your eggs whisked you're gonna take your biscuits and then just cut them in half and then in half again so just like this and then like this so you have four little pieces of biscuit and then you can just go ahead and toss these in to your egg mixture [Music] and then also to your egg mixture you're going to add in half of your bacon and you're going to want to save the rest of it to add on top [Music] and then if you're making the full recipe go ahead and use a 9x13 baking dish since i'm kind of having it i'm just going to do like an 8x8 we're going to go ahead and spray that and then add our egg mixture into our baking dish we'll pop it into the oven at 350 degrees cooking it uncovered for 20 minutes then we're going to bring it out top it with more bacon with cheese pop it back in for 10 more minutes and then we're going to have the most scrumptious delicious bacon egg and cheese casserole like y'all i'm like drooling i cannot wait okay this is already looking so good so now we're gonna top it with more bacon and with cheese i actually only had like three slices of bacon left so i just went ahead and cooked the rest of it that way we could have like extra bacony casserole so we're gonna add that to the top and then if you ask me there is nothing better than velveeta slices because it just melts so good so i'm going to take a couple of those and just tear them apart lay them on top and then we'll pop this back in the oven for about 10 more minutes [Music] okay this is out of the oven and it looks so good but also our house smells amazing i think there's nothing better than bacon in the morning so i'm gonna go ahead and get some for this guy so we can taste test this also the recipe that i'm going off of basically she was saying that she feels like this is like a deconstructed mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese biscuit oh so see that's why i'm so excited because i love a mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese yeah they they have probably one of my number one bacon egg and cheese biscuits the same hold on you know i gotta smell it we know we know how does it smell i mean i don't know if i would have thought this unless you said it but it really does kind of smell like a mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese biscuit you know what i think makes it more like that is the um velveeta cheese that's exactly what it is [Music] my goodness you're right bucky i'm being serious you're being serious it pretty much tastes kind of like a deconstructed bacon egg and cheese biscuit which that's what it is i know but usually you don't love breakfast but you think it's really good because that's a very simple recipe and y'all this would be great for like thanksgiving or christmas morning or just like an easy weekend breakfast recipe for your family this will be a nice uh weekend breakfast for the family i agree yeah because it i mean i don't know it was so simple it looks like you've like quartered up some biscuits and dropped in some eggs and cheese and bacon yeah so simple yeah that's good okay yay seriously though and it's hard to get a breakfast winner out of me you know trust me i know so now i'm gonna go make me a plate have some get ready for the day and then i'll meet you guys back in here and we'll make our third recipe okay so i did not end up making that recipe yesterday so it is the next day bunkie and i are still in our pajamas we have not gotten ready for the day we're having a very slow morning it's very nice and i have saved i feel like the best recipe for last shut up this is going to go down as like i feel one of the best canned biscuit dough recipes we're making blueberry monkey bread with biscuit dough wow it's going to be crazy good so let's get started we're going to start by getting our biscuit dough we're going to cut it into quarters you're going to need some flour some sugar butter cinnamon and then of course the star of the show some blueberry pie filling no mr b at least you know that hamburger joe's is coming your way later wow that was a big old pop that was a good pop i am so excited for joe's should we just like pick one regular biscuit or do you need the whole thing we can bake one regular biscuit probably okay let me give you the trash thank you okay clean kitchen is a happy kitchen so crazy okay let me get this brightness down because you all know how it is in here okay now you got your biscuits we're just gonna cut them like i told you guys into quarters heavens the betsy the lighting situation is crazy and our dishwasher still doesn't work so i'm using the butter knife to do this because that's all that's clean i wish i could laugh at that but it's not even funny i don't find it hard we have to get a new dishwasher okay well i finished these me you go ahead and get our flour and sugar in your bowl quarter cup of each quarter cup of each and then we're gonna add butter and cinnamon to that as well you got it yeah i was i was exaggerating the difficulty there okay i'm gonna give you the camera and you do you the recipe says like half a teaspoon of cinnamon i want to add just a pinch more than that and that's not even worth measuring so i'm just gonna oh yeah wait no okay let me do it i don't want to do the thing what thing [Music] cinnamon is serious business funky tell you what i'll give you a a rounded half teaspoon okay slightly rounded throw her in there now oh my goodness monkey if you don't push it in there i want to know i'm playing okay now this next part is for softened butter but of course you know we don't have the microwave and we didn't set it out long enough so what i did was i took the two tablespoons and i cut them up i went ahead and like helped us out here so we're going to throw this in and then kind of like mix this together until it's nice and crumbly and then we're going to put it in a ziploc bag and toss our biscuits in there [Music] okay bunkie has mixed this into absolute perfection that's a beautiful topping and you know what it looks like what it really does [Music] okay biscuits are in and then give this a good shake until all the biscuits are coated with our sugar mixture okay so to a medium saucepan you're going to add four tablespoons of butter which is like half a stick and then also your blueberry pie filling we're going to stir this until it just starts to simmer [Music] okay so now back to that same bowl we're going to toss our biscuits back in here and then b is going to pour our blueberry pie filling on our biscuits and we're going to give that a good stir [Music] okay so once you have all of this incorporated you're just going to add it to a bundt pan i went ahead and greased this one really well and then we're gonna pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes [Music] oh and one more thing we are going to put this on a baking sheet to put it in the oven that way there's just no spillage or nothing boils over okay so while our monkey bread finishes up in the oven which all by the way looks already so good we're gonna go ahead and make our little like cream cheese frosting that we're going to drizzle on top now we are not going to actually use cream cheese we're going to use this mascarpone if you have cream cheese use that we just want to try this because i think it's going to be really good and then the recipe calls for half and half or milk we just happen to have milk and not half and half so that's what we're gonna use you're also gonna need powdered sugar and then a little bit of lemon juice and we're just gonna mix this all together [Music] now if you use cream cheese you're probably going to need a handheld mixer or if you don't have a big strong guy for sure but monkey's going to use his manpower and stir this by hand or so he thinks and yes he didn't just take a shower looking so fresh you know what i was slapping about a minute ago what i don't know where i come up with this stuff but you know on a wheel of fortune yeah how there's the game called before and after yeah this is before and after what is you taking a shower yes oh my goodness you are crazy don't focus on my jiggle here okay look at it you see it don't look at it oh this is mixing together perfect i need to add a little bit more uh powdered sugar oh for sure because you all know i didn't measure i just eyeballed all this oh that's like perfect consistency because you want to be a little drizzly oh yeah that's what we're looking for okay since it's just me and you eating this i'm going to eat it right off the spoon okay [Music] it's really good does it need more sugar or it's perfect no it's great oh i'm so excited we have like five more minutes left holy smokes that's like liquid cream cheese sugar yes which is amazing like i'll just drink it please you know what it almost tastes like what that good milk after you've had some cereal oh yes that's the best the big reveal oh boy wow i'm really having a hard time not just like diving into this okay we're gonna let it cool yeah for like five or ten minutes then we'll pop it onto our serving platter and drizzle our icing you know what'll really get you what when you try and eat pie that is too hot because that pie filling will burn your mouth you're right you have a squirt tongue and there's in the roof okay we're going to pop this bad boy out will you do the plate part what do you mean oh you're on top this may be a little premature but we cannot wait any longer all right oh this is gonna be just you you okay what i'm coming over there oh okay you be prepared okay just in case you have to grab something okay i have my one hand ready oh boy okay you like it like released i do not but we're gonna let it uh maybe let gravity do its thing for a second okay it's critical to kneel yes when you do the flip yes stuff for sure ah i'm kidding oh it did what's it look oh my goodness monkey only one little part wow this looks so good i am so proud of this it's either cold in our house or that's really hot that's really hot i mean do y'all see this the separation very easily separating very nice and truly this was so simple to make wow i'm going in okay oh my gosh i love how we always sing but we love food we're always like melting out crazy things [Music] well that was worth all of the effort that went into this which was very minimal but the outcome very desirable is it amazing oh yeah and this is very easy to make i do recommend um that that frosting stuff is just delicious the marks could pull i think was a good idea yeah that is scrumptious y'all will have to make it and

P7xlOEf47Zk.json;[Music] so [Music] [Music] hey y'all and welcome back to my channel i am so excited to get in the kitchen with you guys today i put out a holiday appetizers video like right before thanksgiving and you guys loved it and i told you then like i had so many more appetizers that i wanted to share with you guys so today i am bringing you part two to that video we're gonna make three more super easy delicious appetizers i cannot wait bunky picked out one of these and he has asked me probably like 15 times to make this so tonight is a night we're gonna make this appetizer for him and he is on pins and needles it's actually late at night right now or not late at night just like you know night time and monkey and i are going to make these and actually have them for dinner and i am so looking forward to it so on the menu tonight we are going to make the easiest and yummiest little like mini chicken and waffles they're going to be so much fun i cannot wait for these and honestly i feel like if you have any type of holiday party maybe next year i know this year looks a little different these would be like the perfect appetizer for everyone their own little toothpick so anyways we're gonna have those yes monkey but those will appeal to the children as well as adults they will oh my i'm like a kid y'all know that's like all i eat so i am most excited about that and then monkey's recipe that he's so excited about we're calling this like a stacked baked brie i'm calling it a bomb like a bomb of explosion because there's so many things in there like it's gonna be so good and then we're also gonna make some like bacon wrapped water chestnuts baked in the oven with like yummy chili brown sugar sauce on top oh my gosh y'all my mouth is a water ring i cannot wait for these so anyways a little sweet yes let's go ahead and get cooking so for this first one it is literally so simple you need three ingredients you need some frozen chicken nuggets some eggo minis we could only find the cinnamon toast ones i know they make them regular this was the only ones that we could find at like multiple grocery stores but we think the cinnamon toast is actually going to give it like some great flavor kind of like sweet and savory together so i'm not mad about it and then of course you need some syrup to drizzle over top so we're just going to put our chicken nuggets into our air fryer of course if you don't have an air fryer you can just bake yours in the oven and you can use whichever ones you like we just love getting these from sam's they're kind of like the chick-fil-a coffee cat chicken nuggets and we really like those and then we'll put these in the toaster for a few minutes and then we'll have some syrup to either drizzle on top or to dunk them in so simple and they're going to be so cute and so yummy [Music] bunky is making sure every single one is in its perfect location approximately two centimeters away from one inch okay [Music] i always just leave it at the 370 setting you can do what you want and it automatically goes to i think like 14 or 15 minutes i usually leave it on there as well [Music] it's mine on i probably should plug it in first let's try this again bam [Music] okay so now that your little mini eggos are nice and toasted just go ahead and pull them apart so they're kind of like an individual little size and then we'll pop our chicken nuggets on there and our warm maple syrup y'all oh my gosh these are gonna be so good [Music] okay so if you really want to get fancy and impress your guests you could totally like infuse this maple syrup you could put red pepper flakes in there rosemary sage like so many yummy things to give it lots of flavor um since it's just being funky we're just gonna use regular syrup but you could totally doctor these up and make them super fancy [Music] okay so if you like your chicken spicy like me throw on a little hot sauce does that not look so stinking delicious yo ass monkey and i like keep eating these things because they're so good like i cannot stop eating them i keep like thinking of so many more ideas that you could do with these and so is funky he says like you could get a tray of actual chick-fil-a nuggets which obviously i think would be incredible or make like your own little waffles and then i started thinking like if you made your own little waffles you could throw like peppers in there you could throw cheddar cheese in your waffles like you can make them like super savory or you can make them sweet like all kinds of different ways to make these okay so it is actually the next night last night bunkie and i tried to make our second recipe which was our bacon wrapped water chestnuts and the recipe needs toothpicks and i thought for sure we could make them without the toothpicks and they did not they actually tasted so good they just didn't turn out very pretty so monkey and i are like let's scratch this and just go get some toothpicks and we will film that recipe again tonight as well as our like brie that is gonna be so good so here we are it is night two we're gonna get started first on our bacon wrapped um water chestnuts y'all they were delicious like monkey and i kept going back for more of them i cannot wait for you guys to try these they're so easy um so get started on that and then we'll do the break i have everything laid out here that we're gonna need so of course you'll need some bacon and then you'll need some whole um water chestnuts sometimes it's hard to find the whole ones i found these at food lion i looked at walmart they did not have any or they were sold out so make sure that you get the ones that say whole and not halves or slivers and then we made this sauce last night but i will insert footage to show you exactly how to make it it's super simple it's just chili sauce a little bit of brown sugar and a little bit of mayo hopefully we have enough left and i just have some um i call them little skewers little toothpicks um okay skewers toothpicks whatever you want to use i have some here in some water just because we're gonna bake these in the oven i don't want them to like catch fire or anything so i'm gonna go ahead and open this drain it and then i'm actually gonna let bunkie cut our bacon because last night he did not like my size that i cut it so now it's on you buddy i'm gonna show i'm gonna show them how to do it just wait and y'all if you've never had water chestnuts you know how like picky i am and i love them so i say try them they have like a crunch to them i can't explain it they're soft but they have a crunch to them they're very very good not really any flavor so that's why you have to always like either soak them in soy sauce or do something and give them some flavor all right so i think please tell me your technique well i'm gonna go ahead and and trim off see this part right here uh-huh there's nothing that we need there okay i feel like that's just fattiness i might set that aside though i will keep i just want to point out that last night i did not use that part you didn't no i never said but monkey said that mine were like it's big and he wants them to be like this big what was what big my slices of bacon remember how big yeah you were all right i need you to hand me skewers and one skewer one water chestnut okay i cannot wait to see your skills no monkey that's not how you do it why does it have to go around the other way it doesn't matter see it's hard to do it that way no but yo i wish i could put in footage last night of him making fun of me but does it really matter that it's not see your pieces bacon are too long no way yes because it just needs to go around like that funky this is gonna be so good and look i don't think it really matters which direction your water chestnut is facing wow these are so long we can probably do two on each on a skewer let's do that i'm going to give me another chestnut please honestly like if you had two on a skewer and had these like singing a little tray for a party they would be so cute excuse me and i'm i'm doing the uh i'm trying to keep the the fatty side up or maybe that should go down but see as it cooks that'll render down across onto everything i like it water chestnut i feel like you got this technique from um monkey i've been watching this show on netflix what's it called the great great american barbecue cookoff or something yeah we had so much fun watching that show [Music] okay so i've got my foil lined pan here and i did go ahead and spray with just a little bit of pam just to make sure that these don't stick i know the bacon will give it a little bit of grease but i just wanted to ensure that they don't i'm going to line them up and i'm just going to brush them with our sauce and then we'll pop them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes so i'm going to go ahead and insert footage of us making the sauce last night the actual recipe is just a third of each thing so the heinz chili sauce mayo and brown sugar of course i just kind of eyeballed it and that is kind of a lot of sauce so it totally depends on how many of these you're making but if you plan on feeding a crowd definitely do the third of each [Music] so the water chestnuts are in the oven and we're going to go ahead and get started on the brie and just so y'all know bunkie has been waiting very patiently for this recipe if you saw our football food recipe i think it was um bunkie sent me this recipe before he ever even sent the muffaletta so it's been like a long time coming and probably we saved the best for last for tonight because this is going to be a may zing i think my patients will be rewarded yes okay so we have three things to breathe here which is what the original recipe calls for we all know brees kind of like thick so i think what we're gonna do is cut them in half like you saw this somewhere else somebody else did this yeah i did okay so let me explain to you kind of the gist of this so it's bree that's layered between like fig preserves you can use pomegranate preserves whatever one you have it's also going to have dijon mustard mozzarella cheese pepper jack cheese pecans honey prosciutto and then be wrapped in puff pastry and baked like literally i cannot wait for this my jaw my mouth is watering mine too i'm ready okay so let's go ahead and cut our brie in half so we have that prepared first okay you gotta guide me over there okay i really hope this works by the way i think it will okay how am i doing uh good it's getting a little thick in there [Music] just tell me what i'm gonna cut my hand okay [Music] okay so layer one down what goes on this one b uh is this the fig this is fig preserves but you can use kind of whatever preserves you want yeah i think any kind of fruit topping would be fine here fig is my absolute favorite so i think it's going to be amazing hey monkey this is going to be my jam oh my god leave it to monkey to come up with the corny joke i come up with this on the fly people is that too much nah that's plenty perfect that's gonna be good that's gonna squish out so we'll leave that like that and then add mozzarella to the top we're doing lots here okay so honey okay so layer two is honey chopped pecans and a sprinkle of pepper jack i feel like honey is one of those things i just don't consume enough of i know and every time i do i cannot get enough like i'm i'm real excited for this spoon oh there's already chopped oh it says chopped but uh they're not they're not very chopped so we're gonna throw them right there okay next layer is dijon mustard and then um more pepper jack so we're gonna put on it project uh-huh that's gonna be a good layer yeah it is it's like all this sweet and savory okay now we are going to wrap this in prosciutto and then we're going to wrap the entire thing in puff pastry wait what about layer number four oh i forgot we have an extra layer yeah we got an extra stack a big fig preserve again i think for this extra layer we do fig and pecans and mozzarella or pepper jack i think mozzarella i think since we just had a little bit of this might as well finish that off and then we can add a little bit of mozzarella yeah i'm actually thinking the pepper jack's gonna be real good [Music] okay so while monkey finishes rolling out our puff pastry i'm gonna go through and just kind of wrap this and prosciutto i'm just gonna drape it and then we'll tuck it on the bottom and make it really tight when everybody smiles eyes are shining bright i still remember how i used to feel look at us now [Music] walking okay i did make a little egg wash for this too by the way because every time we roll up a layer to the top we're gonna egg wash it so that it all stays put [Music] okay now you've got to cut little slivers on the top of this slivers like apple pie situation i know monkey so like a little little little little okay perfect good you're going too

PvaU4jmwsJo.json;[Music] so [Music] hello friends and welcome back to my channel i am so excited for today's video you guys seem to always like this video i think this is the second or third year that i have done it but today we're gonna make some super easy super bowl appetizer recipes and to be honest i don't even know who is in the super bowl this year i'm just here for the commercials and for the food anybody else with me and y'all i have been like so excited to film this video mainly because i cannot wait to eat all of these delicious recipes and share them with you guys so on the menu today we're going to be making some fried cauliflower which is honestly y'all one of my all-time favorite things to eat you have no idea like i love it and i feel like i do not get to eat it often enough so i cannot wait for that we're going to make it just like regular traditional style and we're also going to make it like a buffalo fried cauliflower blue cheese and ranch does it not sound so good affleck is kind of like a fun take on like your normal buffalo chicken dip that you would have at the super bowl we're gonna do it with cauliflower i was gonna say a little bit healthier but it's fried so i don't know if it's actually healthier and they're also gonna make some artichoke spinach dip and this is the best artichokes bench dip oh my gosh it's so good and there is like nothing i like more for any football honestly for any football game than like a warm dip that just sounds so good and then we're also going to be making some airfryer pretzels two different ways as well so i'm gonna flip you guys around and we are gonna get started okay so i like my florets to kind of be bite-sized i don't want them to be too big but i also don't want to be too small but basically you just want to have kind of a little bite-size floret [Music] okay i'm gonna just crack two eggs into my little bowl whisk them together and i'm gonna take a little flour mixture in here and you guys know my usual suspects i'm going to do a little bit of garlic a little bit of flowers and a little bit of ranch seasoning in my bowl and then we'll dredge it in the egg dread it in the flour pop it in the oil [Music] okay first batch is ready to go in and just so you all know mr b loves fried cauliflower just as much as i do like we are so excited to have this it's like it's such a treat i know oh there's just something about it it's just a little bit different but still it's like a potato but better like a french product better absolutely anytime we go to a restaurant that has like buffalo fried cauliflower on the menu i always order it there goes nothing i'm going to let you do the honors i know i think i'm actually going to use a little our little thing here this just seems a little dangerous you know [Music] as i just drop one in [Music] okay that already smells so good i know i cannot wait i cannot wait so we'll just let these go until they're like golden brown and then pop them out put them on a paper towel to kind of get that excess oil off and sprinkle a little bit of sea salt [Music] y'all for some reason i was just doing egg and then flour but monkey reminded me we're supposed to do flour then egg then back in flour it just gets like a better breading on there so if you made these try it that way do these not look so good if y'all have never had fried cauliflower trust me it's like the best little tastiest french fry you'll ever have in your life and i just have some of that like big flaky sea salt so i'm just going to kind of get a little pinch and sprinkle it on top while these are still um like fresh and hot out of there what is your favorite way to eat fried cauliflower because usually i love dipping my french fries in ranch and i like these in ranch but i love the way they taste with ketchup i know you do i am still trying to figure out what my favorite dipping sauce is with fried cauliflower because it is good with ketchup it's so good y'all i can't explain it i don't like it as much with ranch but if we're buffaloing them or at least some of them yeah i think then that will be good with ranch yeah for sure um california pizza kitchen is where i get my fried buffalo cauliflower blue cheese and ranch and oh my gosh it's so good [Music] okay we've already been over here sneaking a couple of bites oh my gosh y'all are going to love these um so this is the first batch that we did not flour egg flour and these are the ones that we did so you can see they just get kind of like a better little breading and crust on there okay so to make these more of like a buffalo fried cauliflower i'm just going to mix together a little bit of this ranch which by the way this is like our new favorite brand of ranch it is so so good we try and get it whenever i want to get one free because it is a little bit more expensive four dollars a jar yeah but so worth it so but it's two dollars on sale yes so i'm gonna mix a little bit of that in my bowl and then add in lots and lots of this frank's red hot mix it together and then drizzle it over top and then add our blue cheese because monkey feels like since they're fried he doesn't want them like dredged in hot sauce so we'll just do kind of like a drizzle [Music] you know how good do these look and of course you could do like some very fancy finely chopped green onion add a little color but oh my gosh can i eat one i'll have a picture for you regular cauliflower which you can dip in anything you want to and then he's going to try our little buffalo i want to try one too little buffalo whoa looks so good i need a bite somewhere in here give me some blue cheese on there yes please oh my gosh i'm i literally almost feel like i'm eating a chicken wing right now i'm telling you it's so good wow that is awesome i need more but i want like a big piece of blue cheese i also eat my fingers no glass and we can dunk it enough leftover i'm gonna just dunk it right in there yeah like michael jordan okay so now it is time to get started on this artichoke spinach dip and i actually made this on a different day so i'm just going to pop it in here but to make this you are of course going to need some spinach some cream cheese garlic sour cream you're also going to need some mozzarella of course some artichokes if you have the ones that are already um half i would still go ahead and kind of cut them up really finely you're also going to need some smoked paprika but we'll talk about that in a second a little bit of cayenne pepper if you so choose to add that in some parmesan cheese and then of course a little bit of salt and pepper i will of course type out this recipe and leave it down below in the description box for y'all but like i was saying you want to kind of give those artichokes a rough chop and then you're just going to add everything to the crock pot this could not be any simpler and if you want to use frozen spinach you totally can do that just let it thaw first and then kind of wring out any of that excess water and that spinach will wilt down so don't be afraid you can add lots more if you want to and as far as the smoked paprika goes i felt like my mom used to add that in whenever she would bake this when i was a little girl i'm gonna have to ask her because now i'm not sure if she did or not bunkie said he didn't love the smoked paprika in there it still was absolutely delicious but he said he could do without it so you guys can decide if you want to add it in or not but like i said this recipe will be down below in the description box but now we are going to get started on these incredible super easy airfryer pretzels so like i said the next recipe is gonna be these airfryer pretzels and y'all this could not be any easier like this is probably the most simple recipe you will ever make and you can do so many different things with this you can make these however you want i'm going to do them two different ways so one way is going to be more savory with like butter garlic cheese you could also add pepperoni you could add whatever you want to them and then the other way i'm going to do is sweet with like cinnamon sugar you look at super bowl parties that there's like a lot of desserts i think there's never like a lot of desserts at super bowl party certain options are very always minimal right so this is gonna be like an easy way to kind of like slip something sweet in there i feel like when you get to the super bowl you get like chocolate chip cookies for real maybe uh bat cake maybe this is just an actionable party i don't know but i feel that way too so i'm like i need to do something that's a little bit more sweet as well and all you need to do this is a roll of pizza dough like literally this could not get easier they take five minutes in the air fryer um so i guess i'm gonna do the other ones with like the butter and garlic and cheese and then once those are done we'll make the dessert by the way i got the inspiration for this recipe out of my air fryer cookbook i know i've showed this to you guys before but i will link it down below i love paris she actually like follows me here and watches some of our videos she is so sweet and she actually wrote this cookbook and it is fantastic so i will link it down below for you okay [Music] i told you i really didn't think this board is gonna be big enough but watch bae you ready see we're gonna do hmm okay let's get the other one transferring okay so now that we've got our dough situated in our cutting board he's just gonna take our pizza cutter and just make strips in here we're gonna try and do like eight so we can have four savory and four sweet but we'll see how many we can make so you just go ahead i'm gonna cut it um in half to start that way we have an even right uh-huh and then we're going to go half here and then half here [Music] our minds are so different because i would have never done this yeah but now they're very even yeah this is smart this is good okay so to this melted butter i'm gonna add in some parmesan cheese you know that's good okay i'm gonna add in some garlic oh funky supposed to use a spoon for my garlic oh really i guess i'll just dump it oh no let me get another spin okay i'm adding a little bit of ranch seasoning of course i mean why not you don't like garlic oh that's probably good okay and then a little bit of um you just sprinkle this on top after they come out yeah no no before you put them in oh okay okay wow that is a delicious little i know it's gonna be so good okay so you need to get twisting on our pretzels all right i just taught monkey the technique let's see if you remember it my only thing is like are you sure you want to leave them flat let me just do it no but i'm saying like you don't want to like roll them a little bit and make them like round and when you just like pick it up u-shape and twist see oh it's like the old loop swoop and pull yes this is clean right yeah [Music] okay so now we're just gonna brush our little mixture right on top of these then i'll sprinkle on the um cheddar cheese as well as like some flaky salt and we'll pop them in the airfryer do okay so we're going to pop them in our airfryer basket and then 350 for five minutes [Music] when you're ready because i'm ready to heat imagine we're rolling oh my goodness gracious look at how puffy though look look it hold on you'll have to see it you cannot you cannot i know what you're gonna the height but is that one yours oh yeah that is the one that i made i was like i know you want to say that yours looks prettier than mine that one looks pretty good dude bunky wow and b was like saying how he was like there is no way these are gonna be done in five minutes and they're literally perfect yeah that's wild and you can totally like um heat up some marinara mm-hmm and like dunk these in marinara or add like pepperoni to these like pizza pretzels yes there's so many ways you could make this is uh just opened up a a wild uh idea of thoughts i cannot wait i mean can we just take a look at these things i wish y'all could smell them see them in real life like look at that oh my gosh these are gonna be so good [Music] wow these are gonna be pretty that one's really pretty too okay so this time to our melted butter i'm gonna add in a little bit of cinnamon and a little bit of sugar and then we'll brush that on [Music] look how pretty those are bunk i know okay five more minutes all right okay so those are done we're gonna take them out and i actually made a little glaze to go on top of these to make them even more delicious this is so easy it's just like powdered sugar a little splash of milk a little bit of vanilla and a little bit of butter and we just made it in the same container that already had the cinnamon sugar in there to give it more sweetness oh my gosh okay pop those bad boys out i wouldn't just like dump my finger in there monkey i'm gonna die you're good check that out oh my gosh i cannot get over how easy and good these are we ate the um other ones yeah they were so good bunkie said for sure he would love like marinara with it i think so too or like a um funky melted cheese oh my gosh of course get you some good old fritos cheese dip oh my gosh monkey these look so good oh i turned that back on [Music] does this not look heavenly i mean i'm about to devour all i feel like i'm in a donut factory and it smells like it in our kitchen i mean it doesn't get much better than that i've been wiping this bowl delicious stuff

QaWySOTk4ac.json;[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete tomorrow we're heading down to our trailer on the Grand River we're getting together with some friends we're going golfing and then we're gonna do a potluck I'm putting together a nice pasta sauce it's gonna be filled with vegetables and I'm gonna put together a lovely meatball stuffed with mozzarella cheese let's get to our sauce first so in a large pot I'm starting out with a hundred ounces of San Marzano tomatoes some of the best tomatoes that you'll find you want to put these in and use your hands or a potato masher to mash them up a little bit you know what makes a magnificent sauce is doing it the day or two before and cooking it slowly once I put in all my ingredients here I'll cook it nice and slow two three four hours how much time do you have at least two hours but I'll let this sit on here all afternoon and that'll give me time to make my meatballs so to our Tomatoes we're gonna add a 13 ounce can of tomato paste now if you want to cut this down in half this recipe all you simply have to do is buy some smaller cans of tomatoes like these ones here there are 28 ounce just use two of these and divide all these ingredients by half next we're gonna put onions finely diced I have one white large onion one yellow bell pepper 1 green bell pepper finely diced I have eight cremini mushrooms chopped up here 1 zucchini zucchini is a great addition to any red sauce it would just absorb the flavors and carrots I've graded these carrots in a hand grater and they'll not only give you more veg more fiber but it will sweeten up the sauce oregano I've got 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning 3 tablespoons I've got 3 bay leaves a teaspoon or 2 teaspoons each of salt and pepper you can always season it more at the end I've got 3 finely diced cloves of garlic fresh from our garden yesterday and also fresh from our garden yesterday I have some fresh basil just finely chopped up beautiful aroma we'll mix that all up bring it to a little bit of a boil then let it simmer with the lid on we'll let it sit check on it every half an hour give it a stir and that's it let's get to our meatballs stuffed with mozzarella cheese so let's make our delicious meatballs to start off if you want a nice moist meatball I have three slices of cubed bread to that we're gonna add 2/3 a cup of milk we'll get those all nice and moist and wet and then we'll set these aside and we'll add them to all the rest of our spices and so on once they've softened up nicely next we're going to start off with the tablespoon and a half of garlic powder tablespoon and a half of onion powder two tablespoons of Italian seasoning 3/4 of a tablespoon of oregano 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper there's lots of salt and set in the parmesan that we're going to add and the ketchup that we're going to add so we don't need lots of salt to this I'm going to add two tablespoons of ketchup 1 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and our bed starting to look nice and wet now so we'll get that in there mix this up well I'm going to add some eggs three eggs I've got three pounds of lean ground beef going into this and the eggs help find our meatballs so in with my three well beaten eggs you know they're flavors all mixed well I find doing this prior to putting in your beef you get all the flavors mix nice and evenly it's not a real pretty slurry in there but it's gonna give us a nice moist meatball with terrific flavors looks like the bread is pretty well spread out nice and evenly now so now I'll add my three pounds of lean ground beef I'll mix this up real well I'll get my hands in here and the next we'll roll up some meatballs and stuff them with mozzarella cheese I have a pan ready for the oven that's lightly greased my mozzarella cheese is cut up into 1-inch cubes roll up ur meatball press an opening down for it your cheese put a cube in and roll it up it's that simple [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the sauce has been simmering for almost two hours now the last half hour or so I'll leave that top just slightly off just to get rid of some of the moisture and now it's time to get the meatballs in 400 degrees we want to brown these up nicely so we'll flip them halfway through want to make sure all the pink is gone in the center let's get them in the oven these are pretty big meatballs I left them in for 20 minutes I'm going to flip them now and get them back in another 15 or 20 and I think they'll be ready oh my I know that for tomorrow for the potluck but I got a try one with a little bit of my sauce there it is all plated up oh my that looks delicious time to try it out I mean balls and the sauce are all done I think it's gonna work out great tomorrow for a potluck down at the river but now I get to try the goods the mozzarella cheese you can see it just oozing out let's give it a whirl very juicy I have my sauce a little bit of my sauce in there little mushroom on the side Oh [Music] so tender and moist that's the way to make a meatball well folks I hope you enjoy this video if you do don't forget to subscribe hit that red button and every Monday you'll be notified when I come out with a new video well thanks for watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music];['primeros']
qbr66y4qp6g.json;we loved getting the appetizers from you guys I got several dips so I thought it would be fun to do an entire video just dedicated to the dips I'm gonna be starting off with a crock pot one this one right here was actually submitted by a family member Monica has been married to her husband John Michael for 18 years they have two beautiful girls they Adventure in their RV they go out to really fun places a couple of years ago Monica and John Michael bought the dream property and built the dream house and I'm not it's not even like a massive house it's nothing crazy like that but when I say it's the dream house I mean we ask them for their house plans like it is ideal the setup is so gorgeous but Monica is the one that reminded me of this recipe right here and my husband is gonna be so excited because this one is his favorite probably tasted this one before and you may have even made it it is so easy we're making a smaller version so I will have the full recipe Linked In the description box foreign ahead and browned up some sausage so we've got sausage here in a pan I just went to the butcher at the grocery store and just asked for a quarter pound because we just didn't need to make a full pound of sausage we don't need a full thing of cream cheese if I were making the full recipe I would add that in goodness that is stuck normally it comes out in a easier to easier get to get out of the package what am I trying to say normally it's easier to get out of the package okay so I'm just gonna do I'm gonna do about half of this y'all if you didn't see my last subscriber appetizer video I was all over the place there were so many bloopers and this one kind of feels like it's gonna be that way it's all going into the crock pot insert I have another recipe that requires cream cheese so I'm just gonna set this to the side and to that you're going to want to add something like Rotel this is the version of Rotel that I got at Whole Foods it's the same basic thing so if you um you can also just add tomatoes and the little canned green chilies you can absolutely do that too so I'm gonna do about half of the can and then we like Rotel a lot in different things so I'll just reserve the other half and it'll go in another recipe okay so my husband's actually at work today because they're having a Christmas party normally you guys know he works from home but he's gonna come home and be so excited about this okay so you can see here I'm not even like really mixing it together it's gonna go just like this into the crock pot now this is a very small crock pot just wait this is my husband's crock pot from college so when we do something that just requires a small crock pot this is the one that we use my husband was a basketball player in college so everything was basketball so but it's very convenient when you need to make small things so I'm just gonna set this to the side we are going to turn this on high but if you're gonna cook it all day long I suggest cooking this on low so we'll come back in a little bit and Stir It Up I think this is best served with tortilla chips we do have some blue corn tortilla chips left over from the last video I did so that's probably what we'll serve it with but I've got some other little things that I think could be good with this too little bread crusty bread so we've got a couple options here foreign this next recipe came from Janie Marie I believe I don't have any other information about her she left me a comment and I haven't heard back but Janie Marie submitted this and it sounds so easy let me tell you what she said but I have a super good no cook appetizer first of all no cook that's really easy you take an eight ounce block of room temperature cream cheese spread it onto the center of a plate or medium sized platter pour a bottle of cocktail sauce in the center of the cream cheese and spread it over not going over the side of the cream cheese that's interesting place crab meat all over the cocktail sauce you can buy a can of crab meat where they sell tuna fish in your grocery store sprinkle three diced up green onions over the top and serve with club crackers place the crackers all around your dip on your plate or platter it's always a huge hit at my Christmas parties so we are going to make a version of Janie Marie's appetizer here I'm using this leftover cream cheese I'm gonna do this on a platter and kind of see how we can make it look we'll see how this goes so I'm gonna take this cream cheese and we're just gonna plop it here in the center of it's it's mostly room temperature it's probably a little harder than room temperature but I think we can work with it so we're just gonna kind of spread it a little bit I don't think it has to be perfect I mean have you guys seen the cheat uh what the like butter boards where basically it's just all these different kinds of butters on like it's like the new charcuterie board I guess but this it's similar to this kind of concept you're just spreading it around and then um adding the stuff to it I think this is just really neat a really cool concept mine may not be as pretty as Jamie's because I'm not 100 sure how she does it I actually made up of my own cocktail sauce you guys this was so easy to make and yes if I were making a bigger recipe I could have easily gone and just bought this at the grocery store but I knew I only needed a little bit because we're making smaller versions of all of these this was so easy it's ketchup lemon juice prepared horseradish and Worcestershire so incredibly easy to make okay so we are going to let me just give this a little mix again and I'm just gonna do like a kind of a Sprinkle drip kind of attempt to kind of drizzle over the top deal Janie is this right I think it looks cool it's gonna look cool okay she said not to go over the edges I'm sure that it's gonna get all over the place when we end up dipping the cracker in anyway though okay that's maybe she does more than that but that's all of the cocktail sauce that I'm gonna put on there I got some crab meat from our like the seafood section in our grocery store and this one was on sale this was actually at the second grocery store I went at the first grocery store this was 26 dollars I was like that's an expensive appetizer when I went to the second grocery store it was actually on sale for 9.99 that's a lot better plus I'm gonna use some for this appetizer and then a lot of you talked about some different crab appetizers to go with my leftover wontons from the last video If you haven't seen it I'll have it linked here so you can see it but I thought that's perfect I need crab for that anyway so I'm gonna open this and let's just add some to the top [Music] now I got the claw says wild caught claw claw crab meat this appetizer is right up my alley [Music] okay this is really fun I want to try it now but I feel like I need to wait for my husband to try it because you guys just really like it better when the both of us do taste test together we set this to the side just for a minute and let's chop up some green onion now I'm assuming she uses majority green Parts because I think it's mostly probably for looks now let's add some of that green onion to the top [Music] don't tell I'm gonna try it that's good okay that's really tasty and so simple I I am pleasantly surprised by this one now I don't have club crackers but I picked these up at Whole Foods today they're just already made up little um crusty bread crostini so I'm just gonna that's loud I'm just gonna add these and then it'll be ready to go this is awesome [Music] you guys I absolutely did not intend this but it almost kind of looks like a little crab with the toast on the side like this which makes it really cute by the way this one is an everything bagel cheese ball and the stuff in this it sounds delicious okay this one was submitted by the Alias is Texas Stardust she said I was previously married to a chef and I did a lot of experimental recipes even an almost flourless chocolate cake long before it was a thing the year was 1993 and she was making it for his birthday so she said she loves this one served with Crispy bagel chips or Cracker assortment or pretzels and she said it's so easy no cooking you can make several smaller ones which if you've seen this video right here I did make several small cheese balls and it's so neat the way that it's served I'm gonna make one cheese ball for this one just for the purpose of this video but I love making them mini cheese ball size as well you guys know I've been making smaller versions so she said she uses one package of softened cream cheese I'm gonna use the half of the package always feel like you can cut recipes in half and a quarter you can triple them double them whatever you need according to the size part you're serving I did not realize that my cabinet was open the whole time I was filming that okay we need a little less than a tablespoon of prepared horseradish so I'm adding that in we do need to chop up some green pepper or scallion do whichever you would like and [Music] [Music] let's just start to combine this a bit we need some cheddar cheese to go in this and of course bacon always you guys know we usually have it prepped and ready to go I actually just prepped it today so it is right here ready to be added so we're just crumbling it up into little pieces and I'm adding about two pieces or so but I had cut mine in half so they're smaller already now we mix all of this together and then we will put it inside of some plastic wrap to form that ball shape I'm like really gonna love this one it's just all the ingredients that I love we're going to just take this and put it here in the center and then this will help us like form that ball shape the cheese ball foreign for at least an hour and then we'll finish this one up okay so I'm gonna pop this in the refrigerator and then move on to another one my little cheese ball has actually been in the fridge for a couple of hours let's finish this off and I think I'm Gonna Roll it in a bowl so I've got some of this everything bagel seasoning Trader Joe's sells this Walmart sells this they're all over the place now I've seen it at Aldi okay so I'm just gonna put some in here and let's just plop this in roll this around we're just going to make sure we get some of this seasoning all over it so she said she uses like a half cup I don't think we needed that much because I did a smaller version the dish that I wanted to make this next one in is has just grown legs it's gone so we're gonna make it a mess this one sounds like a recipe that I almost grew up with because whenever we make chili we do free what we call Frito mess and it kind of seems like a play on Frito mess okay so this is from Alicia Alicia says that she has a son a grandson and a granddaughter she loves to cook she said she's actually won several cooking competitions and she's been cooking since she was eight years old so this one sounds really really easy I don't even know what we want to call this it sounds delicious though okay so we are going to take some of this cream cheese so I've got a half of a block left okay so we're just going to put that here in the center I am going to spread it just a little bit okay I don't know if she does this but this is kind of like my take on it [Music] all right and I just made up a super quick chili she said that she uses pour a can of chili over it now I already had all the stuff a lot of the ingredients were being used in dinner tonight so I went ahead and just made up a super little quick chili here we're gonna throw this over the top it already smells delicious okay now I definitely think that a no bean chili you guys know this is a debate on my channel whenever I make chili I actually love beans in our chili I know that's not Texas Chili but I do think that for this recipe it's better to have no beans but that's just you listen you make any recipe however you want to make it you know that is a motto here on my channel I'm just going to use all of it even though that's kind of a lot of chili I think it'll be okay okay she said she tops this with cheese and then she bakes it in the oven I don't know how long or what temperature I'm gonna go 350 and we're just gonna bake it until the cheese is nice and melty foreign [Music] cheese I'm actually using a pepper jack because I already had it shredded you can use whatever you want to use you guys know that as soon as my oven is preheated this is going to go into my preheated oven and we'll we'll start at like 10 minutes and see how it looks but I think if as long as it doesn't spread too much chips around the edge here could actually be really pretty this recipe is a goat cheese dip super simple I mean crazy simple this was submitted by narissa and she says I'm in love with goat cheese lately so a really easy one is goat cheese baked with marinara sauce then use some garlic naan or crusty bread to dip if you want to be if you want it to be sweet you could switch the marinara out for some apricot jam nerissa says I live in northern Michigan so winter is frigid and long I have a wonderful husband and an amazing eight-year-old son named Marsh we also have three yellow labs who love to clean the floors when I cook and make messes with food I have a tethered spinal cord along with some other issues so I'm unable to work it this time she loves to cook and bake for her family and she can tell that I do as well it feels like I'm cooking with a friend when I watch your channel I love that you guys I love that okay so let's try this recipe I've got some goat cheese here oh and it needs to get used it's actually expiring in like three days so this is perfect timing now this bowl is oven safe so I'm kind of hoping that I can just do everything here in this bowl we'll see how it goes I mean this is crazy simple okay I've got a marinara that I just made up really quick you guys know I prefer to make ours up but you can do it however you want to do it and I'm just going to Top This goat cheese with the marinara that's it I mean and oh oh I have some non-bread so I will end up toasting that up so actually let's cut that into triangle pieces and toast it up I don't know if she spreads the goat cheese out but we're gonna try it just like this I feel like it needs something green okay I know this isn't ideal but my parsley did not look good the fresh parsley so I'm just gonna add some um dried parsley and actually that looks really pretty so I like that we have this naan bread I'm just gonna go ahead and cut it into triangles and then we will toast it up on a baking sheet in the oven but we all really like naan bread so this is great you could add a garlic butter to this if you wanted to um I mean you know you can buy garlic naan bread already if you want we'll just do a quick toast on these once the oven is preheated and ready to go and I haven't had lunch yet so I made up the Crusty pita bread it just went in the oven for about 10 minutes or so let me just put some of them in here make it look a little prettier this recipe might be the easiest one that was submitted but I had to pick it just for the stuff that came with it okay hey there I'm Jenna I'm 35 years old and I'm from Lansing Michigan I'm a bonus mom to my boyfriend's three wonderful children and I'm also a full-time manager of three salons so I'm very busy all the time but I'm Italian and I really love to cook and bake it's therapeutic for me and I really enjoy making food and goodies for my family I was at my friend's holiday gathering everyone had already eaten the actual meal but of course you're always hungry for things later we were chatting in the kitchen and the host pulls out a hand mixer salsa and cream cheese and sets it out she says it looks disgusting and too easy to taste but I tried it fell in love and I've brought it to pretty much anything I've ever been invited to since it's always a crowd pleaser everyone loves it and it's constantly requested I like to put mine in the fridge for a couple of hours or overnight for a thicker consistency but it's awesome immediately as well she also says P.S tell your husband I know exactly what Fazoli's is we still have one left on the south side of Lansing and it was my favorite place to eat growing up so if you missed it in the last video where my husband and I were cooking together we had a conversation about Fazoli's and so there was lots of conversation on that one I am cutting this one down she said she uses two blocks of cream cheese we just don't need that much so I'm cutting it down I'm I have about six ounces here in this leftover in this container I'm gonna put mine in my KitchenAid mixer because then I can focus on other things while that's mixing up so she said she just mixes it up for a couple of minutes and then it's good to go so this is 14 ounces I need about eight or so ounces of salsa you could use whatever kind of salsa you like [Music] all right let's try it this is just the salsa mixed with cream cheese so simple but I mean I don't think it looks disgusting she said in the in the notes that it looked disgusting I don't think it looks disgusting which it was in like a big dish you wouldn't gravitate toward it true is there Cholula in there no there needs to be it's really good yeah I got mild salsa and I do feel like if we had done a medium or a hot we would like this even more these are two flavors that I already love so mixing them together that's it's kind of a given for me can is there another appetizer like that exists that takes 30 seconds to make I mean if you have somebody coming over and you need something to throw together how often do you not have salsa and cream cheese in your house this is perfect foreign do you know what's in this my sausage dip it is your sausage awesome told you guys he would be excited for that one all right so let's Stir It Up a little bit just a little portion but I know you're gonna eat the whole thing so now I'm regretting having that crumble cookie at the end of the work day okay so we're going to eat it we're going to try it with these little mini toasts that I got at Whole Foods it's gonna be hot it's too much too much what these this has to be with chips okay so we're not going to eat them with the toast we're gonna eat them with chips there's more in that bag too like it's just what do you mean too much the ratio it's too much of that too much bread oh because you like this so much yeah this is probably my favorite dip if I ever see it at a party or anything that's the one he's going for yeah all right so with chips not with the toast because the toast is overpowering yeah well no not overpowering but that toast should not be an item it's like if you have two huge thick pieces of bread on a peanut butter and jelly and you can't taste any peanut butter or any jelly because the bread is just overwhelming we already know that we like this one we're just trying it for yourself yeah okay thank you Monica [Music] we have the everything bagel cheese ball there's horseradish in this oh nice which I thought was really interesting then we have a little thing that we can oh yeah we do a cool little thing so everything bagel I like the addition of the horseradish it's good I'm not a huge fan of cheese balls to begin with I love cheese balls but for a cheese ball it's good I do like that horseradish aftertaste it just adds this other element of flavor so as opposed to just getting that cream cheese cheese and bacon there's something else there that you're like oh that was interesting I I actually really really like that one I would consider adding horseradish to any cheese ball because of that so this one is the goat cheese with marinara I had a spinach and goat cheese Empanada today at Cantina 1511 for a vendor luncheon and it was good yeah if you have a Cantina 1511 that's that's excellent it's so good she said she's been a fan of goat cheese a lot lately but if you just put some marinara over it and bake it it's really good I think I think that I could have put more marinara on it though because there's a lot of goat cheese there yeah but it's it's similar to that the pizza deck pizza dip yeah but the pizza dip is with cream cheese right I think so but you could sub cream cheese if you're not a fan of goat cheese you absolutely could do cream she's here yeah I like this more because it feels lighter than the cream cheese yeah to me but I like it I like the flavor of it I think the kids are really gonna like that one yeah and I mean it took minutes it really was you guys saw goat cheese and then marinara if you're using jar marinara it's even faster than what I did okay so this one is it's cream cheese chili and cheese and she said it's best served with Fritos we don't have any Fritos obviously it would be perfect yeah what's in the chili just my normal jelly except no beans I didn't know beans you can put a glob of sour cream on the top that is so good that's the money appetizer right there it doesn't need the sour cream now now that you've tried it do you still feel like it agreed that's really good that is really good this is delicious oh my goodness okay we this is gonna be a winner I think for everybody for sure yeah I can't think of anything else I do other than just Cholula but that's yeah what I do for most things no yeah but all these flavors work together together perfectly if you had the big Fritos the scoops that would be ideal what's this person's backstory Alicia is her name oh she says to top it with chopped tomatoes and green onions too so Alicia didn't give me much information about like where she's from and stuff this is delicious it's very good this is cream cheese cocktail sauce crab meat and green onion I like this one because of the uniqueness of it yeah I like the flavors together like cocktail sauce hits you first I mean we have more crab in the fridge I feel like I wasn't generous enough with the crab on this one that's what I was gonna say you guys know I was trying to hold back because I want to do something else with it before we tasted it together and I really liked the way that everything works here he our son gives it a thumbs up this has been sitting in the fridge for a little while like a couple of hours actually while I was making everything else and my husband thinks that it would actually be better if we let it set out for a few minutes and just come to room temperature and I totally agree and I actually think it may have said that in the instructions that she used uh room temperature cream cheese oh thank you so much to everybody who submitted your recipes I'm going to be doing another one of these in January and I already have it planned it's going to be with another type of food so stay tuned I cannot wait because I think that this one's gonna be really good and I'm making a mess like usual wool so I'm going to now we're gonna add something [Music] what are you doing I know you guys are gonna love these as much as we did if you need more inspiration for appetizers check out the video above [Music];['primeros']
QSn9d_EHcBM.json;[Music] you hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious is always my model today we're gonna mess around with some frozen pastry that I get from the grocery store and then we'll use our own stuffings one a traditional pizza style the next one is an old New Orleans favorite a muffaletta sandwich will incorporate those flavors into a puff pastry it's outstanding you're gonna love it let's get cookin let's start out with our buffalo filling we've got some Italian sliced meat we're gonna start off with our six slices of mortadella a nice Italian meat six slices of salami and six slices of ham now we need to chop this up so simply roll up each stack of meat cut it down the center a couple of times and then chop it up we'll go through all our meats our objective here is to get them roughly about the same size and then we'll put them into a bowl now here's our jar of muffuletta salad mix you'll find that in most grocery stores around the pickles it comes in either hot or mild the choice is yours we're going to use 1 cup of our muffuletta mix and then we're going to add two cups of provolone and mozzarella mixture even amounts of both give it a good mix set it aside and we'll get to our second filling we're gonna do a pizza filling in one of our pastries for our pizza filling they're gonna need 30 slices of a good quality pepperoni we're gonna cut those into quarters and then we've got for fresh basil leaves roll them up like into a little cigar and then we'll finely dice those and place this all into a bowl and to that we'll add three cups of Italian mixed grated cheese 1/2 cup of olives 1/2 teaspoon of oregano 2 tablespoons of red onions finely diced 1 cup of pizza sauce and then mix all well we'll set that aside and let's get to our puff pastry so I'm using a store-bought puff pastry comes to in a box take 1 Oh simply unwrap it and lay it out flat now the key to any puff pastry is using lots of flour otherwise things get to be a sticky mess some on your hands as well and a little bit on your roller now these pastries come out to about 10 inch by 10 inch all we need is about an extra 2 inches that gives us a perfect thickness for our pastry so with a few gentle rolls we can gain about 2 inches on each side of our pastry and we'll end up with about 12 inches by 12 inches now we'll need a sharp knife and cut slits about every one and a half inches on both sides noticing noting down the center because that's where our filling is going to go so these slits will be about 3 inches long we'll start out with our pizza pastry simply lay the filling down the center take a little bit of time and spread that filling out evenly starting at one end begin to fold over the pastry they're going to overlap one another the two ends and go lengthways and then begin to fold in the sides Criss crossing each one that's what gives it that lovely look after it comes out of the oven now have a sheet pan ready with some parchment paper on top I use a big flipper to help transfer it over and now let's start getting ready our muffuletta puff pastry using the same method simply lay down the filling down the center and then we'll do the crisscross all the way down the entire loaf you can use a knife to trim off any excess pastry now with both our loafs on the pan we're going to brush it with a little bit of egg wash so give us that nice golden brown color and for a little extra flavor we'll put a little sprinkle of fresh grated Parmesan over the top now let's get it into the oven 375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes and oh my here it is fresh out of the oven for the muffuletta is on the left the pizza filling on the right doesn't that look outstanding now here's a great option for your filling use egg roll wrappers or wonton rods these are made from flour and eggs you can get them vegan without the eggs usually get 25 to 50 in a package and they're fun to work with so we'll lay one of our sheets over and down two sides we'll give it a little rush of egg wash we're gonna add our muffle lot of filling to it and we'll just simply fold it over and rub the edges together now also using a fork will help seal this once you pressed it down with your fingers use a fork and this will help seal the wonton wrapper I've had a lot of fun creating different fillings for these and you can bake them or deep-fry them today I'm baking them simply place it on parchment paper and a cookie sheet 350 degrees Fahrenheit 25 to 30 minutes and oh my look at this don't they look outstanding nice and golden-brown you can reheat them the next day they're delicious cold and they freeze well these are so versatile whether you're having it for a meal or an appetizer the wontons cut them in half so they're finger sized they're great rewarmed in the oven the next day and they're delicious cold same with the puff pastries cut them into strips finger size lay them out in a plate two different flavors muffuletta pizza whatever ones you come up with they're delicious well I hope you and your family get to try them out and don't forget to subscribe to my videos I put one out every Monday hit the little red subscribe button and you'll be notified now I'm gonna give them a taste oh boy get the muffle outta here [Music] Oh outstanding I love the all the flavors in there and the vegetables

qyRcWUj3iGs.json;hi lovelies so a few weeks ago I shared some of my very favorite homemade broth recipes and you guys seemed to really enjoy it but in the comments section I got a lot of questions about bone broth now bone broth is very trendy right now it's super high in protein really really healthy and it's really easy to make so I did some research and I've done some testing and today I'm sharing a great bone broth recipe with all of you now of course as the name suggests to make bone broth you need to start with some bones now I've seen this done with lots of different types of bones but the classic is made with beef bones so I found mine in my supermarket you can usually though just ask your butcher they'll definitely have some that they're trying to get rid of they're actually really inexpensive so that is not bad at all one important step when you were making a bone broth like this is roasting your bones now it's not essential in terms of getting a bone broth happening but it is going to help develop the best flavor so we're just going to arrange our bones on a baking sheet and then to amp up the flavor even more we are also going to roast our vegetables now this is an optional step but I think roasting vegetables definitely helps bring out the best flavors I'm going to add some leeks some carrot some celery some onion and some garlic as you can see I've chopped everything really roughly you don't have to be fussy about it all of this is going to be simmering for between 10 and 12 hours so just get them on the pan and get them into the oven and we'll just bake these for about 30 minutes or so we have developed a ton of flavor by roasting all of this beforehand now we can transfer it all to our slow cooker now you always have the option to do this in a soup pot but we are going to be simmering this for between 10 and 12 hours so slow cookers I think are the better tool for the job because you can kind of set them and forget them whereas leaving your stove on for that long kind of just makes me a little nervous so slow cooker in it to add even more flavor to my broth I'm going to throw in a big handful of fresh parsley I've got some fresh bay leaves I've also got some whole peppercorns I'm going to toss in here a good amount of salt and some water it should be said bone broth is considered a sipping broth so instead of cooking with it or using it in the soup recipe most people will actually just sip it hot as it is so you really do want to add as much flavor as you possibly it can because you are going to really taste it once we've got this all topped up with water we're just going to put our lid on and then set our heat to low and let this cook for between 10 and 12 hours yes it seems like a long time to wait but you have to remember the secret to the nutrition in bone broth is really slowly extracting all of the amazing nutrients and vitamins hidden within the bone 10 to 12 hours later your patience will be rewarded what you'll end up with is a nice savory rich broth I'm just going to finish this off with a few splashes of apple cider vinegar to add some much-needed acidity and then all you'll need to do is strain it at this point and skim the fat bones like this often render a lot of fat so you may find it easier to allow your breath to cool completely and then you can just really easily skim the fat off the top with a spoon totally up to you though once you've got that fat removed you can store this in the fridge for up to three days or in the freezer for up to three months and then just use it as you need it a bone Appetit I really hope you guys found this tutorial helpful and if you have any other questions about bone broth don't hesitate to leave them in the comment section below I will do my best to answer as many as I possibly can and of course if you give this a try it be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because you know I always love seeing your creations if you're looking for more great homemade broth recipes I've got a ton of them on the channel so take a look for those and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more deliciousness where this came from;['primeros']
RnStH45AWMg.json;[Music] hello lovelies i hope you all had a wonderful holiday and you got to indulge in all sorts of deliciousness if you're anything like me maybe you're feeling like it's time for a bit of a reset time to get your eating back on track in honor of the new year and if that's the case then you've come to the right place because today i'm going to be sharing one of my very favorite recipes for a super simple but super nourishing hearty vegetable soup now i have to tell you this soup was actually inspired by my cleaning out the fridge i love to clean out the fridge in honor of the new year i just feel like it gives me a nice fresh start with my eating and in doing so i found all sorts of tasty produce that had sort of seen better days and so i thought what better way to use all of that produce than to toss it into a really yummy soup like the one i'm going to show you today now if you're looking for some fridge organization inspiration i happen to have a couple of great videos here on the channel that will really help you get your fridge sorted in no time lots of easy tips tricks and shortcuts for doing it i'll link those videos in the description box below now to get started i have got my nice big dutch oven i'm going to get that heating up over medium-high heat and i just want to add a little bit of oil to the bottom of my pot you don't need too too much but we're just going to be sauteing some veggies here now as soon as my oil is nice and hot i'm going to go ahead and get some veggies in here so i have got some onion some celery as well as some carrot that i just peeled classic ingredients in soup and also ingredients that i use for my holiday stuffing so whatever i had left over i just i'm going to toss into the pot i also had a rather sad looking bell pepper sort of hidden in the back of my fridge you know when the skin gets a little bit wrinkly so i decided to give that a quick chop and i'm going to get that in my pot as well i love the smell of these ingredients in a pot one of my favorite smells in the kitchen so once our veggies have had a nice chance to soften up a little bit it's time to add even more grape flavor to this and i'm going to be doing that with a whole heaping helping of minced garlic you know when it comes to garlic i really like to go for it in this kitchen never hold back i'm also going to go ahead and add some italian seasoning to this so i'm aiming for a bit of a minestrone feel with this soup and the italian seasoning goes a long way to achieving those flavors now in terms of the protein in the soup you have tons of great options if you've got any leftover chicken or turkey or even some beef from the holidays you can definitely throw those in the pot i'm gonna go ahead and keep things really simple though with just some canned chickpeas that have been rinsed and drained i always have chickpeas on hand in my pantry and they're a great source of both fiber and protein which is why i love them so much next for the liquids in this recipe i'm going to be using some fire roasted tomatoes i love the really subtle smoky flavor that fire roasted tomatoes have but if you don't have fire roasted tomatoes on hand you could also use plain diced tomatoes in this recipe those would work as well then i'm going to add my broth to the pot so you could use vegetable broth or beef broth here i'm actually using a chicken bone broth because it's loaded with protein and collagen which are two things of course we could all be getting more of once i've got all of that yumminess in the pot i like to add just one more super secret but super delicious ingredient and that is a parmesan rind this is basically the skin that's left over after you're done grating a nice big hunk of parmesan cheese what i like to do is store the rind in the fridge until i'm making either a pasta sauce or a soup like this and then i just pop the rind right into the pot and let it simmer away with my soup in doing so that amazing umami flavor of the parmesan transfers into the soup and you get a really savory taste that is absolutely irresistible i should mention this step is optional you don't have to use a parmesan rind but if you have one in your refrigerator and you're cleaning it out anyways definitely pop it right into your pot you will not regret it at this point we're just going to let this mixture come to a boil and as soon as it's reached to boil we can go ahead and pop a lid on our pot reduce the heat to medium low and let it simmer away for maybe 20 to 30 minutes you just want to give it a chance for all of those wonderful flavors to really come together once it's finished simmering you can go ahead and discard that parmesan rind because you won't need it anymore all of its amazing flavor has been infused into our soup and then we're going to add our finishing ingredients so i really wanted this soup to be as nutritious as possible so i want to load in lots of yummy greens this is some kale that i've just given a quick chop to i'm just going to stir it in and give it a minute to wilt in with all of that other yumminess to this i'm also going to be adding some peas now i'm just using some frozen peas these have thought out and i'm going to add them straight to the pot and i'm also going to hit this at this point liberally with some salt and some pepper always good to season your soup at the very end just before enjoying and this tastiness is ready to be enjoyed i have to tell you guys i absolutely adore the color and the texture of this soup not to mention the fact that the flavor is out of this world you can serve it up with some nice crusty bread if you want to and i like topping it off with just another sprinkle of that parmesan cheese mwah

sbGm_Bq0GVw.json;[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today we're doing risotto I used to think it was a complicated process but it's not you need a bit of time so take your time set out an hour of the day it takes about 25 minutes but by the time you dice and slice get yourself a glass of wine enjoy the ride risottos fun to cook if you have the time I'd like to give a shout out to Ryan Stewart for this recipe better known as Stewie I retired from the fire hall five years ago hard to believe time flies when you're having fun well when I worked at the fire hall was Stewie he shared some great recipes and still does today not only a great firefighter but pretty amazing in the kitchen - thanks doing let's get to it we're using arborio rice it's an Italian short grain rice it's high in starch and that's what gives risotto its creamy texture let's start off and prepare our vegetables we'll need one half of a large onion finely diced one bunch of fresh asparagus just simply snap the tough ends off and discard those and then we'll dice up our asparagus into half-inch pieces [Music] if you're a garlic fan like I am we gotta add so let me show you a quick technique commence your garlic to remove the paper like cover over the clove simply smash it and then give it a little snip off of each end and the paper will just fall right off now finally dice the clove of garlic but that's not going to be fine enough to add to our risotto so we're going to use some coarse sea salt this will be like an abrasive it will just smooth out our garlic so when we add it to the risotto it will all mix nice and even once you've learned this technique you'll wonder why you ever bought jarred minced garlic the fresh flavor of it is so much better [Music] my badge is all prepped now one more thing we have to do before we get making our risotto we're going to boil the asparagus will only boil this for two and a half minutes then we'll drain it and set it aside as we'll add this to our risotto a little later on we're going to need six and a half cups of broth of course a homemade broth is always preferred but here's an option this is called better than booyah it's a chicken base you just mix it with hot water it has some great flavor and the other option is a vegetable this also comes in an organic vegetable base low and sodium it's delicious I mix the two together and do half chicken half vegetable bring it to a boil and then just set it off on a side burner on low add three tablespoons of olive oil to a nonstick deep sided and my Heat's on medium my objective is just to soften up the onions it'll take about 4-5 minutes now we'll add our two cups of arborio rice stir it thoroughly to ensure that it gets coated with the oil continue to stir for three or four minutes and then we're going to add one cup of dry wine I'm using a Pinot Grigio just because that's what I like to drink I'm gonna load a medium heat and we'll stir until that's absorbed now we can start the process of adding our broth first we'll add two ladles of broth when you're doing this process of adding the broth slowly remember you're not whipping up a Marais take your time stir it slowly you want to get all that broth absorbed take your time it'll come out nice and smooth you'll end up with a nice luxurious risotto now this process of adding one ladle of broth at a time it's going to take 20 to 25 minutes as the liquid dissipates you just simply add another ladle of your broth and stir it in gently [Music] and don't leave the stove you got a baby set this dish take your time it'll all come together as we reach the end of adding our broth to the Arroyo rice you'll notice it becoming more creamy each time that's from the high starch content in a Wario rice give it a taste the rice should have a slight chew to it and we'll add a couple pinches of salt we're not done yet let's add four tablespoons of butter that will help get it even more creamier and smooth and our minced garlic stir that in well and now we'll add one cup of fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano [Music] and now we can add our asparagus and look how nice and creamy it is that's what you're looking for add three or four freshly chopped basil leaves place a lid on it for five minutes and it's ready to serve it up risotto is such a versatile dish can be used as a main or a side a nice mean for this is always chicken maybe a nice balsamic chicken whatever you choose this risotto is so delicious look how creamy it is just lays on the plate and spreads out oh boy my mouth is watering [Music] now that wasn't so difficult was it and risotto goes together with all sorts of things like seafood mushrooms and asparagus and I'm gonna give it a try Wow it's creamy the asparagus is just cooked perfect you get a hit of the parmesan and that slight hint of garlic that we put in there you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music];['primeros']
sG02yWNlCIU.json;hey lovelies the weather outside is cooling down which means things in the kitchen are just heating up and today we're celebrating the arrival of soup season with this absolutely incredible chicken pot pie soup yes it is just as good as it sounds basically it is all the goodness of a chicken pot pie except without having to fuss with any pie crust so what's not to like about that for me guys in all honesty soup seasoning is my favorite season when it comes to food so I am so excited I've got my nice big Soup pot on the stove and honestly I will tell you guys once My Soup pot is on the stove it basically doesn't come off the stove until the spring because you know how much I love me some soup so in my nice big Soup pot I've got a little bit of oil heating up over medium high heat and then just as soon as my oil is nice and hot I'm going to start adding my classic mirepoix that's a fancy name for basically onion carrot and celery the base for any great soup in my opinion I like letting my veggies cook up for say between three and four minutes just until they start to soften then it's time to get some garlic into the pot glorious garlic the more garlic the better especially when it comes to soup now after about just 30 seconds or so that garlic becomes nice and fragrant and that means it is time to add our flour to the pot now the flour is going to help thicken this soup tremendously so it gets nice and creamy and delicious I like to let that flour cook for about a minute or so stirring it constantly because it really helps to get rid of that flowery flavor you know what I'm talking about right and once we've cooked that flowery flavor off time to add the rest of our ingredients starting with our chicken so of course it would not be chicken soup without chicken today I have got three chicken breasts that I shredded you could easily make this recipe with leftover chicken or with rotisserie chicken from the supermarket you can pull it apart and use that chicken you could also actually cook your chicken right in your Soup pot if you want to but I find this is the perfect place for leftover chicken so whenever I have it this soup is on the menu next I'm going to go ahead and add some potatoes to this I've got two potatoes that I've peeled and diced and then it's time for my chicken broth you really want to use a good quality chicken broth in this kind of cooking as far as I'm concerned it really does have a huge impact on the flavor if you've got homemade chicken broth of course that's optimal but if you don't go ahead and use the store-bought kind there's lots of awesome versions there and the final ingredient we'll be adding is my favorite addition to pretty much any pot of soup I've got some sprigs of thyme headed in here and I'm just going to put them in hole and let them work their delicious Herby Magic and we're going to bring this to a boil and as soon as it's reached to boil I'm going to reduce my heat to about medium pop a lid on top and let this cook away for about 12 to 15 minutes basically all I want to do is make sure that my potato is cooked through and has become nice and tender and those flavors have had a chance to develop a little bit I will mention this is a very quick cooking soup you could sort of simmer it low and slow if you want to but if you're in a pinch and want to serve it on a busy weeknight this soup can be cooked in under 30 minutes not too bad for a weeknight suit alright so after 15 minutes you can see it's so thick and Rich it smells amazing in here guys I have to tell you at this point I'm ready to just add my finishing ingredients so I'm going to go ahead and get in here with a nice big splash of cream the cream in this recipe is optional but it does help to make a really rich and delicious broth so I highly recommend it and then I am also going to add some corn to this so I've got frozen corn kernels here I'm gonna add those right in and I've also got some peas you could pretty much add any veggies you want to this soup that's what makes it so good it's super versatile and then finally I'm also going to add a nice big helping of freshly chopped parsley to help brighten everything up a little bit and honestly guys how gorgeous is this soup you just want to let it cook for another say two to three minutes just until your corn and your peas are heated through and then it is ready to be served it is the perfect thing for fall it's so rich and comforting you can serve it up with some nice crusty bread if you want to to soft up all that yumminess this is a total crowd pleaser your family will absolutely adore it at least mine does and I hope you will give it a try for yourselves if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook

sIywNJ0uG68.json;hello lovelies autumn has arrived and with it comes two of my very favorite things sweaters and soup today I'm kicking off soup season with three unbelievable chicken soup recipe is that your entire family is sure to love just before I get to that I wanted to remind you guys that we are offering 50% off our 12 week meal plan bundle over a healthy meal plans calm it was specially developed by our in-house dietician to be nutritionally balanced it features a ton of amazing recipes and the best part is it can be customized to your personal preferences I hope you will check it out you can use the promo code eat well to get your discount and all of the details are in the description box below so you can find them there now without further ado let's get to some chicken soup I really couldn't be more excited guys soup day in our studio is one of the best days of the year today I'm starting with an incredible herbed chicken and rice soup and of course it's really delicious and it's got a ton of classic comforting flavors now I'm just gonna get started by heating up some oil in a nice big soup pot like this if you don't have a soup pot like this I always recommend investing in one it is by far one of my favorite things to splurge on in the kitchen if you're looking for one similar to this I will link a few options in the description box below they're really really great to have in the kitchen and they last forever as soon as that oil is nice and hot I'm going to get my chicken into the pot today I'm using some boneless skinless chicken thighs that I've cut into cubes you could swap in some breasts here if you wanted to or if you wanted to make this job even easier you could use a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket or even some leftover chicken you've got options is what I'm saying I'll season my chicken up with a little salt and a little pepper and cook it until it's nice and browned on all sides because our chicken is cut into nice small pieces it takes no time to cook up and then you can get your veggies into the pot so I am adding an onion some celery and some carrot in this recipe all three are must-haves as far as I'm concerned in the chicken soup recipe and I'm just going to let those cook up with my chicken for maybe another two to three minutes I want to just give them a quick to soften up once your celery has turned nice and bright green that means it's time to go for it with even more great flavour I've got some garlic headed in here as well as some fresh thyme fresh thyme is just so essential in a classic chicken soup recipe I can't live without it I'll let my garlic and thyme cook up for another 30 seconds or so to reach their maximum flavor potential then I'm going to add my rice to the pan as well as a nice splash of white wine now the white wine in a recipe like this is absolutely optional you could just skip to adding your chicken broth here and that would be fine but I think it adds really wonderful flavor and it should only take a minute or two of cooking to get the alcohol to evaporate out of your wine and then you can go ahead and add your broth to the pot as well as one bay leaf I'm using a dried bay leaf today but fresh would definitely work in this recipe one important thing to note in this recipe is that it's important to use a lot of chicken broth because of course our rice is going to absorb a ton of it during the cooking process and if you don't use enough chicken broth you're basically going to end up with cooked rice but not actually soup so go ahead and use quite a bit of chicken broth we're gonna bring this mixture to a boil and as soon as it reached a boil we will reduce our heat to medium-low pop the lid on it and let it cook away for say 10 to 15 minutes you want to make sure that your rice is fully cooked and nice and tender then we'll just remove our bay leaf from the pot because I'll be honest it's not all that delicious to eat on its own and we're going to stir in some freshly chopped parsley at this point this yumminess is ready to be enjoyed I guarantee you this will become a family favorite for years to come the best part is it reheats beautifully the next day so you can take it for lunch or a second dinner totally up to you next guys for something a little bit different but unbelievably delicious we're making chicken alfredo soup yeah it's soup that tastes like chicken alfredo pasta and oh my gosh it's unbelievable tasting but really easy to prepare it all starts once again with my nice big soup pot I've got a little bit of oil heating up and to that I'm going to add my chicken in this case I'm using chicken breasts but once again you can use what what kind of chicken that you want I'll season that chicken with some salt and some pepper and let it cook until it's nice and browned on all sides next I'm going to add some onion to my pot and as soon as my onions nice and soft I'll add some garlic to the pot as well after about 30 seconds or so you'll be able to smell that amazing garlic aroma and that means it's time to add a little bit of flour to my pot now the flour is going to help this soup get a bit of a creamier thicker consistency but we want to make sure to cook off that floury taste first so I'm going to cook my flour for about a minute but you want to make sure that you're stirring it constantly because otherwise it does tend to burn next I'll get my chicken broth into the pot as well as a good splash of cream now this recipe will work with both milk or cream cream is obviously going to make it a little bit richer milk will make it a little lighter it's totally up to you what your preference is we want to bring this mixture just to a simmer keep a close eye on it because of course anything with milk tends to Scholz really easily and as soon as it's simmering I'm going to reduce my heat to medium and add my pasta to this now because this is a chicken alfredo it felt right to add some pasta I'm actually using some fresh cheese tortellini that I found in the deli aisle at my supermarket you could use beef or chicken tortellini here as well both would work but I find cheese tortellini is perfect with the rest of the flavors in this dish the great part is because we're using fresh pasta in this recipe it takes almost no time to cook usually your tortellini will be cooked between 4 and 5 minutes then we can go ahead and stir in our greens in this recipe today I'm using some baby spinach but some kale would work here as well of course it would not be alfredo without some freshly grated Parmesan so we shouldn't be alfredo using too much and I'm going to wrap things up with some freshly chopped parsley we'll give it a quick stir and it is ready to be devoured and I will just tell you devoured is the only way for this soup to be eaten in fact it was basically gone almost as soon as we were done shooting it finally if you're looking for a soup that's rich warm smoky and spicy then this chicken tortilla soup is definitely it for you it does have a ton of ingredients but don't be intimidated by that they're actually all really simple you have most of in your pantry already and I would say some of them are optional I'm using a lot of spice in this one to get really maximum flavor but you could use something as simple as a little chili powder and this would still be really really tasty I've got a little bit of oil heating up and to that I'm going to add my chicken I've got it seasoned with a little salt and a little pepper for flavor as soon as my chicken is brown I'm going to add some onion and some red bell pepper to my pot and let that cook up for another three to four minutes just to tell they're tender then I'm going to add some minced garlic and some jalapeno to my pot you can skip the jalapeno if spice isn't your thing but if you do love the heat I recommend absolutely going for it here I'm also going to add a little bit of tomato paste to this the reason I love tomato paste in my cooking is because it's got a ton of great concentrated tomato paste flavor speaking of flavor of course a chicken tortilla soup is all about the spices so I'm using a combination of chili powder I've got some dried oregano I've got some cumin some coriander and I'm even adding just a little hit of chipotle powder now I'll be honest I had all of these great spices just hanging out in my pantry so I went for it but if you're missing any one place it's not gonna make or break your soup you really just need chili powder and the rest is just for extra flavor I like giving those spices a minute or two to heat up in the pan stirring them constantly heating them up like this really maximizes their flavor potential then to my pot I'm gonna go ahead and add some canned black beans that I've drained and rinsed I've got some corn some diced tomatoes as well as some chicken broth headed in here then it's just a matter of bringing this yumminess to avoid and as soon as it boils I can reduce my heat to medium and let this simmer away for between 15 and 20 minutes the good part about a soup like this is that it doesn't take long to become excellent if you wanted to let it simmer for longer say an hour you definitely could but it's not absolutely essential while that soup is simmering away we have time to work on our tortilla topping of course it's chicken tortilla soup what would chicken tortilla soup be without some crunchy tortillas on top now if you wanted to keep things simple with a little supermarket shortcut here you could use some store-bought tortilla chips but of course I like going extra mile we're basically just taking a few corn tortillas and I'm gonna cut them into thin strips and then I'm going to arrange them on a baking sheet toss them in a little bit of oil some garlic powder a little salt and then we'll just give them a toss so everything's coated evenly and get them into the oven at 350 degrees for say ten to twelve minutes or just until they are completely crisp I know buying tortilla chips is easier but you won't believe how great the flavor and texture is on these chips now that our soup is ready we can finish it off with a good squeeze of fresh lime juice some salt and some pepper and it is ready to be enjoyed piled high with those amazing tortillas what is not to love guys chicken soup three delicious ways I hope you will give all three of these recipes a try and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because they love seeing your kitchen creations remember all

little horse trailer it's so cute and it's the best coffee and it is just like the perfect way to start my day so i'm gonna do that i hope you enjoy the beautiful scenery of the marshwalk i love it in the morning when the sun is like sparkling on the water and then i'm also going to make some oatmeal for bunkie and i and then go get in the shower so i can get ready for the day [Music] do okay so i am out of the shower obviously i still need to do my makeup but i want to tell you what we're going to do today um i have to kind of whisper because tomorrow is funky's birthday and i still need to get him a birthday present so we gotta go out and do some shopping so i can hopefully get him what he wants he's been talking about this um sorry i'm really trying to whisper she doesn't hear me he's talking about this like um blower and weed eater for the yard that he wants from clothes so that's gonna be our first stop to see if we can try and find that um and i need to get in like a card i plan on making him some avocado toast in the morning so anyway you gotta do that and then i also want to make a new recipe for lunch i think it's gonna be so good i am like looking so forward to it um but first before i do my makeup i am literally so excited and a huge thank you to don beauty for sponsoring today's video i have been using dime for the past year and i have told monkey so many times wouldn't it be so cool if i got to work with dime and now it like it's actually happening and i just am so thankful and so excited because i have bought used loved their products for the past year and it has like truly helped my skin so much so i'm so excited to like show y'all my little morning routine is before i do my makeup so if i didn't take a shower in the morning i would go ahead and use the gentle jelly cleanser i love this i use it every single night it never makes my skin feel like it's stripped of its nutrients if anything it feels like it balances out my skin it feels super supple afterwards and still hydrated and it almost just like melts off my makeup which is awesome so i use this day and night and then my tried and true product and the whole reason that i fell in love with dime was because of their toner this is truly the best toner i've ever used and for that same reason because my skin feels perfectly balanced afterwards it doesn't feel stripped it doesn't feel like it's burning or tingling it feels good and hydrated and supple and so i have loved this honor so much now for my serum i use the hyaluronic acid serum and y'all if you want hydrated supple plump glowy skin this is your serum your serums like your powerhouse that's what's going to penetrate deep in there and if you don't use a hyaluronic acid or don't know about them they actually help to like retain moisture in your skin so it is like the greatest thing if you are dry or normal and you want that like hydrated glowy look this serum will be your best friend you just put it on after toner and before moisturizer they also have the hyper glow serum which is just going to be like your brightening serum so if you have dark spots or pigmentation this one is great and then for moisturizer they have the dewy day cream and then also the restorative night cream so depending on if it's day or night and both of those are incredible not too heavy perfectly hydrating and just to tell you a little bit more about down beauty they offer luxury skincare beauty and wellness products at affordable prices which is another reason i love them so much because the skincare is so good and it's affordable and they only use clean ingredients they are vegan cruelty free and they have no harsh chemicals like y'all does it get better than this time also uses eco-friendly glass packaging

present there was like five different ones to choose from so i'm hoping that i got the right one i asked the guys in there if they could help me and they said if it was for their birthday this is the one they would want and i'm pretty sure this is the same one that i saw monkey looking at um so it's his new blower and we needer and hopefully he loves it i'm actually really excited to give it to him tomorrow i need to ask him like what he wants to do for his birthday because he hasn't told me so hopefully we'll go to dinner or something to celebrate but anyway i'm gonna head home so we can make our yummy lunch i'm so excited for this and i'm honestly starving so i'm ready to cook okay really fast well monkey is not down here his mom came over last night so we could celebrate his birthday with her she's at the beach this weekend and she got monkeys and chocolates in her shirt look forever and ever she has always drawn this little monkey on like anything she gives to be and so now this little monkey is like what we call a bunkie how cute is that and no way i had to whisper because he can hear me but she hid the dinosaur and i thought he hadn't found it he found the dinosaur so now i've got to find it he hid it from me what's the plan stan for what for your birthday what do you want to do tomorrow i don't have any thoughts yet funky you don't i'm just going to spend it with you but are you wanting to like cook dinner here do you want to go out to dinner do you want a certain type of dinner do you want balloons in a cake pop like well i don't think i need uh i don't need a cake pop because we got the good cake right oh yeah monkey's mom when she came over last night she brought our favorite aldi cake y'all it's ridiculously good and i do think that i i want to go eat somewhere you wanna go to dinner yeah are you thinking like italian cheeseburger mexican food these are your favorites we haven't had mexican food in like a month we gotta find a new spot down here we haven't we haven't found our new place yeah can you keep thinking on it i'm a noodle on it okay so now for this lunch recipe i saw this guy make these chicken wings on instagram and they looked so good and my bunk loves some like air fryer chicken wings and i never eat any um lemon pepper ones you'd ever order those either i feel like but heated lemon pepper and hot sauce and he did um like baking soda it's baking soda bacon powder and he did some baking soda on there to like help everything i feel like adhere and stick better and get more crispy yeah it helps with the crunch the conscious vacation the crunchification yes so i'm so excited to make these are going to be really simple and the only thing i'm going to tweak because y'all know how to tweak something is i'm just going to add in a little bit of garlic powder because i feel like i just need some garlic flavor in my chicken wings agreed so these are going to be really good garlic flavor on everything exactly y'all know we are some what do you call like a vampire who loves garlic vampires do not like vampires stay away from us okay so here's our setup we got the wings um you're just gonna need a little bit of oil i'm just gonna use our avocado oil like i said the garlic powder baking soda hot sauce and then i picked us up some lemon pepper seasoning we're switching something up real fast so i went back and watched the recipe one more time and they say baking powder not baking soda and bunk says he feels like corn starch would be even better so we're going to do corn starch it's only like a tablespoon so honestly it's probably not going to make that big of a difference right right i'm looking to see what else we got up in the cabinet i don't think we have we might have baking powder but no we do but i just feel like cornstarch is really the more traditional appropriate option yeah okay all right so here our chicken wings in here and do all the things just like i said before okay so drizzle of oil and then our lemon pepper which they use a lot we're going to do a just sprinkle of this cornstarch and then i'm going to add in my garlic right now as well [Music] you want to be our tosser yeah oh yeah what can i get in here with this fork too yeah i mean spit this is a spoon all right let's see here i think we might need to uh add a little bit more lemon pepper yeah we'll see where this gets this first are you trying to have some like delicious chicken wings for lunch i'm so hungry i know me too i i ate an apple earlier oh i'm proud of you thank you i did have my little bit of oatmeal i forgot about you have some oatmeal i've had an apple and um you know we're both getting our fiber and you know what i decided actually today i want to make use of like pretty oatmeal with like blueberries and raspberries and honey and cinnamon like that is a bunky breakfast yeah i mean you know the pretty oatmeal is what really it was a pretty oatmeal i'm gonna sprinkle a little more coverage there that's good oh these already look so good you got a nice color going about them was it enough oil oh yeah yeah they're uh i'm still gonna sprinkle a little more lemon pepper on there how much did it say i mean he didn't do a lot let's do a little more garlic too okay now these are going to go into the airfryer at 380 degrees how long did it say 20 minutes um i think he said between 15 and 20 minutes so i guess but i mean my personal preference is longer because i like all of the fat to render out you know take us in like extra i like crunchy crispy wings okay so we're gonna go 380 probably for more like 20 minutes plus [Music] okay so they've been here for a little over oh actually a lot over 10 minutes probably 15 minutes oh bonkey oh wow these look so good yeah they do oh my goodness i was just going to say i would give them a little shake yeah they look like they need a little shake wow these look really good i feel like yeah we need to get all these undersides facing put that one over right there which one this one no that one this one no this one yeah i think that that like cornstarch makes a difference it definitely does okay we're popping these back in for the remainder five to eight minutes we'll see okay so the chicken wings are done in the airfryer we're gonna put them in another bowl and then toss them into melted butter which if you've seen the past couple videos we still don't have a microwave we have like seriously gotta go get one this weekend we need to put that on the list oh thanks i underestimated the uh how often we use one yeah i didn't realize that um microwave is a frequently used tool yeah we were like oh we can get away like not having one but no we actually need a microwave so anyway i'm just gonna put a little bit of butter in my bowl and then toss our chicken wings in there and just let it melt as we like toss them around and then we're going to add our hot sauce and more of our lemon pepper lemon pepper like my mouth jets are going okay butter oh they look perfect these look yummy so good okay tossing these in i might need some tongs now we're gonna add in our hot sauce you all know we like it spicy so however much you want is that a good start point yeah it's your mouth jets going crazy yeah did you you could hear that yeah okay and then just a little bit more of this lemon pepper [Music] i can smell that yeah my nose is uh my nose is definitely perked up look a little bit more oh yeah he he said two tablespoons that's a lot [Music] these look amazing well i'm excited to bite into one i'll let you go first okay all right nice nice fingertip coat already oh yes [Music] give us the low down is the lemon pepper hot sauce the bomb diggity or is it weird it's not weird i think the um daisy may smell so you still get the good you know classic heat right yes daisy may want some chicken wings hearts can't have no chicken no this will burn your mouth girl but i think the um the lemon uh-huh i i'm having a hard time describing it but it actually like you can it gives it a brightness or something yeah it's almost like it really gives it maybe a little this sounds obvious but like a citrus element yeah and then the pepper of course i mean just so they're really good pepper packed yeah i mean it's it's a nice spin on the classic um just buffalo oh okay i'm excited to try them and one more thing airfryer wings are so easy and they're so good so much more simple than like any other way you can make wings yeah that second that bite i just took was like real real good and pepper goodness yeah okay my thought on these wings is like the lemon pepper i know exactly what you're saying it's like this lemony surprise that you don't expect but is so well complimented with like the buffalo sauce i can't describe it but it's like this brightness and like citrusy that was it's amazing i was imagining like something so powerful like me too lemon lemon juice no i was envisioning like the lemon pepper was gonna be overpowering with the hot sauce yeah but no they're like perfectly paired yeah they're they're nice compliments to each other very good so you all have to make those tell me what you think i'm gonna go ahead wrap up this video here i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with me today be sure you wish mr b a very happy birthday down below in the comments if you're new we would love for you to subscribe be sure you give this one a thumbs up and i will see you guys in the next one bye y'all [Music] you;['primeros']

SQfXTQQF4BE.json;[Music] okay we all know this is like the best time of year because of all of the delicious food and at the very top of that list for me is appetizers I know you guys love them too so today I'm going to be sharing some very easy and delicious appetizer recipes all using crescent roll dough these are gonna be so so good so for this first recipe we are making meatball sub cupcakes y'all these are going to be so good great appetizer you could also freeze your leftovers have them for like a quick and easy lunch you'll need like a cupcake or muffin pan you'll need some frozen Italian style meatballs and these do not have to be thawed you'll also need some mozzarella some softened cream cheese some spaghetti sauce Italian seasoning and then of course your crescent roll does to get started I'm going to go ahead and preheat our oven to 375 and then if you have the crescent roll dough sheet that would work great since I don't I'm going to press my seems together and then we're going to cut 12 even like little squares [Music] okay now in our little Bowl here you're just gonna need four ounces of cream cheese so half of a block and I just sit mine on this stove while it's heating up that way I can kind of bring it to room temperature and make it easier to mix next we're going to add in about 3 4 of a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and of course I'm just gonna eyeball it it's probably good then we're gonna do one cup of shredded mozzarella cheese so just mix this until it's all combined sometimes you gotta get in there with your hands that's what I did to mix our cream cheese worked out great but we are going to go ahead and assemble these I'm going to lightly spray our muffin pan and then we'll Place each one of our squares of Crescent dough in here and then we'll assemble with our cream cheese meatball spaghetti sauce top it with mozzarella these are going to be amazing [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] look so good my mouth is watering so we're gonna pop these in the oven at 375 for just like 15 to 18 minutes someone down here is just so excited for all of that mozzarella cheese that I keep dropping y'all these are gonna be so good My Bunkie is going to love this and like I said freezing it using leftovers that's like a little easy lunch such a great idea okay I've got my taste tester down here these were so easy to make and I wanted to tell y'all I don't know how they got 12 squares other crazy roll though because I tried I only got nine and I don't think they could be any smaller because then they wouldn't fit like in the muffin pan so maybe you just try 9 to 12. but we're gonna let Bunkie taste test this I found a good one actually you know what I found interesting what is how you've got these These are nice with their little pointy edges yes yes I like that rather than it being round well you know what what it's because my squares were bigger than probably the person's recipe that got this from um starting out with a little crispy cheese okay cheese skirt that's what they call it okay monkeys request when I told him I was making these was he said just make sure that crescent roll dough is all done because y'all know he doesn't like soggy dough how did I do that little uh what is it ricotta something funky that's like a little pocket of tree of goodness isn't it that's the game changer that really takes it over the top I was waiting for you to get to it because that's just like a little treasure mine down there it's just cream cheese and mozzarella and Italian seasoning this might even ricotta but ricotta would be good yeah both of cream cheese their color might be too oh wet like it might make it soggy the cream cheese is perfect I think with it being in the oven too it kind of like fluffed up a little bit if that's possible how is this what is this described as a meatball no meatball sub cupcake that is exactly what it sounds like it tastes like rather this is really good yeah it is exactly like eating a meatball sub but in a nice little handheld version of all the flavors there it's really good I would dare say this is better than the pizza dip really in the crock pot bunky are you serious hi accolades right here wow y'all know that means these things are good okay good okay y'all are not even ready for this second recipe because we are taking like two of the very best appetizers of all time and combining them so we have like The Best of Both Worlds we're taking pigs in a blanket and we're taking jalapeno poppers and we are making jalapeno popper pigs in a blanket and they're gonna be so good and you know what I'm laughing about how come every time I'm like searching on Pinterest or just like looking for recipes all of the recipes that I love and want to try all have cream cheese I'm like why is that because this one has cream cheese too but we have our solving cream cheese I'm gonna go ahead and add some shredded cheddar to that some bacon bits if you want to do regular chopped bacon by all means that would be even better I'm just gonna like save that step and then want some seasonings in there start assembling these bad boys okay so to my bowl I have some shredded cheddar cheese I'm gonna add in our cream cheese and then like I said I'm just gonna use these real bacon pieces but feel free to like cook and chop up some bacon if you want to okay that is going in and then to season this I'm gonna add a little bit of Auntie no nose it has like that garlic and onion salt in there so it has really good flavor okay like last time I'm just gonna go in with my hands because that's just the best way to do it if you ask me okay I've got a tip for y'all if you've been around here for a while you know that like one of my very favorite tried and true appetizer recipes is my bacon and cheese bites my mom and I make these for like every single part and get together they are the best of the best but that is basically the exact same feeling that goes into those minus Auntie no-nos so you could just make a big batch of that filling and then you can knock out two appetizers at once make this recipe as well as a bacon and cheese bites so just a little tip and also one more tip if you do use the inky no nose you guys know it's pretty salty so just go very light on it since it already has bacon otherwise you could just do like ranch seasoning or garlic powder whatever seasonings you want to but I just wanted to add that in there so you don't add too much okay so now we are going to prepare our jalapenos if you want to wear gloves by all means but you're just going to like rinse them off and then cut off the top of them and then cut them in half we're going to get out all of those seeds and membrane and then we're going to cut them in half again we're actually going to put these in the oven for about 15 minutes before we actually make our pigs in a blanket um just to make sure they're nice and soft so I'm just taking a spoon and getting out all those seeds and membrane and it just comes right out clean [Music] okay I've got the oven on 350 and these will just take about 15 minutes okay let me show you what we're gonna do with the crescent roll do I kind of just pinch the seams together and this is only half of it I have the other half right here but we're going to take it and cut it like into strips because we're gonna basically like wrap this around the jalapeno and the little smoky so I'm kind of just doing like one inch pieces okay I just did one to kind of test it out so here's how we're going to do this take your strip and put your jalapeno kind of like on the edge over here and then to the jalapeno We'll add a little bit of our cream cheese cheese and bacon mixture kind of like put it right there on top my little more because why not I can't have too much right okay and then you're just gonna like stick your little smoky on there and then just kind of start wrapping it up and then we'll pop these on our baking sheet and put them in the oven if your um crescent roll kind of starts to come undone just pinch your seams together again so just like that this would actually work even better if you just had the dough sheets instead of the kind that has the seam so next time I will remember that [Music] okay I decided to try it with just like the triangle like without cutting it into strips just how it kind of already comes and I think this is gonna work just as good if not better you can get more of the cheese mixture in there okay yes this is how I should have done all of them just use your little triangle uh I may or may not have just broken the trash cans I need you to get peek at that okay and I'm also like cracking up at myself because I made all of our little like little smoky jalapeno pepper bombs Bunkie calls them over here but I had some crescent roll dough left and I was like um I want to make a little breakfast one so I made some sausage and then add that cream cheese mixture so that's what's in like these three but we're just gonna pop these in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes okay I gotta say these look great mommy said this is his dinner I'm proud of the way those turned out I'm very proud you know why why because one of your things is like always making sure that crescent roll is done and those look perfectly golden brown see I'm excited about the uh the change in texture we got on this jalapeno yes looking good well that's because I put them in the oven for like 15 minutes to get soft before I even assembled this that's how you have to do it that checks all the boxes for a handheld goodie oh yeah is it like a flavor explosion that that would be a good way to describe it yeah there's a there's so many different flavors going on what I what I really think is interesting is the way that the uh the little smoky and the bacon they're kind of like they're like playing it off of each other it's like the little bit of bacon in there is really enhancing a little smoky oh okay but the little smokies bring in like the hot dog Vibe yeah but then you got some nice accompaniment of the of the Jalapeno in there cooking the jalapeno a little bit in advance very important it makes it soften up a little bit yeah nice wow okay I love it this one in particular is not it's a little bit more extremely spicy it's more mild nice flavor okay that's what I'm talking about of the crescent roll game this is one of my favorites that you've that you've put before me B okay okay they're gonna be so happy well that's what's for dinner tonight for the monkeys yeah yeah oh my gosh it's good so excited to share our delicious dinner with you guys and a big thank you to hellofresh for sponsoring today's video you have no idea how

everything laid out here to make this recipe we're gonna call these like a little re-bomb I think they are going to be delicious so first things first is you're going to need a can of crescent rolls if you want to get the one that's like a dough sheet that's already that doesn't have any seam means by all means I just already had these in the fridge so I'm gonna use them but first thing you want to do is roll this out and then pinch all of your little seams together um the actual recipe says to cut this into 24 even pieces but since again it's just being funky I'm not going to be too precise unless you want to do the math oh I'm going to be precise oh okay I'm gonna let Bunkie cut our crescent roll dough since you know he's way more precise than me but basically we are just going to cut little teeny even bite-sized squares okay so now that we have our crescent rolls cut into little bite size pieces you're just going to take a mini muffin tin pan and I am going to go ahead and lightly spray it so that they don't stick and then we'll kind of press down our little crescent roll and then we're going to cut our Brie into bite-sized pieces as well and we'll put a little piece of this Brie inside each one and then I'll show you guys the rest of the ingredients [Music] thank you okay so now that we have our Brie in there we're just going to take a little bit of apricot preserves and put on top of it you could also do like fig or raspberry kind of like whatever Jam you want I just love apricot especially with brie and then we're going to also put some chopped pecans on there so you're just gonna take a little Spoonful and put like a little dollop on top of each one [Applause] [Music] okay so next we are just going to top those with a little bit of these chopped pecans and then a little bit of flaky sea salt the salt is going to take it over the top [Music] okay and that is it these are going into the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes okay these are out the oven y'all they look so good I just have them on my cute little Christmas Spode um Christmas tree little platter and then I'll have two over here on my cooling rack for Bunkie and I to taste test I am so excited to try these I do want to tell you when they come out of the oven they kind of look messy but once I got them out of the um pan they were perfectly fine cheers foreign oh my goodness whoa this is so good what are you laughing about I'm trying to find my words to describe this because it's like ridiculous the first little thing I tasted was the pecans and then a little bit of sweetness from that uh apricot but then the Brie comes in at the back the brie is so warm and melty and like oh my gosh it really is these things are worth totally worth making like you cannot just eat one you eat like a hundred because they're so good I try to tell you we needed to make all 24 I tried to tell you okay so now let's get started on this next recipe so of course you will need some crescent rolls some pecans you don't have to put these in there but I think the crunch will be really nice you'll also need just a little bit of brown sugar and some apple pie spice you'll also need a granny smith apple and then one more ingredient that is also optional is some caramel drizzle this one is a salted caramel which oh my gosh it's so good I think I'm gonna drizzle this on top once they come out of the oven but these are going to be super simple to make a great little breakfast or dessert they're going to be so delicious foreign [Music] okay so to get started on our little apple pad bites I just have some melted butter right here and I'm gonna toss my spiced apples into the melted butter and just kind of stir those around until they're nice and coated and then next I'm going to take my brown sugar I'm going to add a little bit of my apple spice to this and give it a good stir foreign [Music] [Music] okay so now I'm taking my brown sugar and apple pie spice mixture I'm just going to sprinkle this right on top of each one [Music] then we're going to take our chopped pecans and just sprinkle a few of those on as well [Music] thank you [Music] okay so once you have them wrapped up you're going to take your leftover melted butter you're gonna brush this on the top and then we're gonna sprinkle them with a little bit more of that apple pie spice foreign [Music] at 375 for about 10 to 12 minutes [Music] okay and for the best part this caramel drizzle oh my gosh these are going to be amazing and I even have some cookie dough ice cream because why not I mean that looks like a dessert I want to eat I know you want to bite of that like right now hand it all over babe hand it all over I'm gonna let you get a bite first but then I want to bite I can feel the warmth under in my on my hand under the plate yes handheld little baked apple pie bites yeah oh well I'm liking the texture so far wow that's really good I'm gonna get into the center here okay take a little bite with some ice cream yeah we didn't have any vanilla so I felt like the chocolate chip cookie dough would be just fun I ate all of the vanilla ice cream yesterday actually I figured yep it's delicious yes this is good and y'all these are so simple to make [Music] well when I was um like a very young boy a little boy my grandparents up in Norfolk Virginia I think for some reason we would have these little smokies like we would eat them for breakfast part of our breakfast for some reason so that might be why they they hold a special place in my heart oh bunky shout out to all my people in Chesapeake Bay Area laughs that's so sweet yeah I feel like your mom still eats these all the time I love them I mean and and then I remember too as I'll go into another story for you I feel like little smokies are one of those things like you would always you don't eat them very often but it would always be one of those things and this might have been like back in the 90s or something but you

swuPBYW2CHg.json;hi lovelies soup season is in full swing at least at my house and today i am sharing a delicious asian inspired soup that i think you guys are going to absolutely devour it's this chicken ramen soup and it comes together in less than 20 minutes which is why i love it so much it's perfect if you're feeling a little bit under the weather because it's loaded with things like garlic and ginger and other great good for you ingredients so it's one of those soups you'll definitely want to add to your repertoire as the winter months are upon us now to get started i have got my nice big dutch oven heating up on the stove you could do this with a soup pot as well if you wanted to and i'm just going to add a little bit of oil to that as soon as that oil is nice and hot i'm going to add my chicken to the pot now i'm using just some boneless skinless chicken breasts that i've cut into small cubes you could definitely do this with boneless skinless chicken thighs if you wanted to or you could skip the meat in this recipe entirely and leave it vegetarian it's absolutely up to you i'm going to season my chicken breast with a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper and then i'll let it cook up for maybe five or six minutes just until it's no longer pink and it started to get a little golden around the edges now it is time to start building some flavor in here so i have got one small yellow onion that i have just finely diced i've also got some minced garlic headed in here as well as some freshly grated ginger so like i said if you're feeling a little under the weather there's nothing like ginger and garlic to help clear your sinuses it also happens to smell amazing so your kitchen instantly is just going to smell absolutely delightful while that onion is just cooking away i will give you guys a bit of a bump update um yes in case you missed it i am indeed pregnant i'm about five and a half months now so 24 weeks uh it's hard to believe in just a few months we're going to have another little one in this household let's just say things are already quite busy here so it should be interesting but of course i am super super excited to welcome this one to our family and i have been extra hungry lately as you might imagine so soups like this have been really really wonderful and then we're going to go ahead and add our broth to this now here i'm using chicken broth but you could also use some mushroom broth or even some vegetable broth both of those would work definitely just a matter of what you have on hand in your pantry and then we're just going to bring this mixture to a boil so once that broth has reached a nice rolling boil i like to turn my heat down to medium and now it's time to add some veggies to this and the best part about this soup is that the sky is really the limit in terms of what kinds of veggies you can add to this basically go through your produce drawer pull out what you have and toss it in you can use some broccoli cauliflower red bell pepper would be really amazing pretty much whatever you have on hand today i'm using a combination of mushrooms which are really classic in a lot of asian cooking so we're gonna get those into our pot for my greens i'm going to be adding some baby bok choy to this now baby bok choy is a bit of a bitter asian green if you're not a fan or you can't find any where you live you can go ahead and use some spinach or kale here instead this is just a great soup to sneak some greens in so i highly recommend doing that and i am also going to be getting some snow peas in here snap peas would totally work as well and we're basically just going to dump them all into the pot and then let them cook away for maybe two to three minutes it doesn't take very long at all with that hot broth for your veggies to just soften up and you'll start to see them turn nice and bright green and that is a good sign you don't want your veggies to get super soggy you want to make sure they still retain a bit of their crunch and after giving our veggies about a one to two minute head start here i am going to add my ramen to this so i'm using just classic ramen here if you wanted to keep this gluten-free you could use some rice noodles instead those would totally work in this recipe and then the final step here is just going to be adding some soy sauce or some tamari to this tamari is just gluten-free soy sauce it's really just a matter of preference because it adds this nice sort of savory flavor that is absolutely irresistible and in a matter of mere minutes friends we are in the promised land so our ramen is fully cooked and nice and tender our veggies are bright green they look incredible my kitchen is just filled with the most amazing aroma i wish you guys could smell it and that means it is time to get our soup on i like topping it simply with some finely sliced green onion and a sprinkle of sesame seeds but if you wanted to kick it up a notch you could totally add some sriracha or red pepper flakes just to add a bit of heat totally up to you but i promise you guys you will not regret making this recipe it is full of amazing flavor and comes together in under 20 minutes in a single pot there is so much to love and i really hope you enjoy it as much as i do if you give it a try for yourselves don't forget to tweet me instagram me or

TwAIp6lyUSI.json;hey lovelies if you were on the hunt for a wildly flavorful wildly satisfying a but wildly vegan soup option and then today you are in the right place because I am making a big batch of my delicious curried cauliflower soup and once you try it I promise you will not be able to get enough it is just so super tasty super being the operative word of course to really maximize the flavor in this soup we are actually going to start by roasting our cauliflower so I've got a full head of cauliflower cut into florets I'm just going to spread it on a baking sheet I'm also going to roast up some carrots carrots obviously add such a nice sweetness some great body to this soup I'm going to drizzle on a little olive oil season this all with some salt and pepper and then sprinkle on a good helping of curry powder now I'll be honest I love to use lots of curry powder in a recipe like this in fact I could be guilty of getting a little curried away we're going to get these into a preheated oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for maybe 20 minutes or so or until they're nice and soft and golden as this all roast in the oven we're going to get some really nice caramelization which is going to add to the sweetness and we are also going to maximize the flavor of our curry powder so there's a lot to love about this now that our cauliflower and our carrots are all roasty-toasty we are going to turn our attention to building more flavor into the base of our soup I've got a nice big soup pot happening on the stove and to that I'm going to add a little oil once that oil is hot you can get your onions into the pan you can also get some minced garlic into the pan once those onions have had a chance to heat up we can go ahead and add some ginger into the mix you don't have to add a ton just a little bit of freshly grated ginger it can really add something to a soup like this then I'm going to get all of my bed Gees into my pot and top everything off with a can of coconut milk and some vegetable broth like I said we are keeping this recipe completely so using veg broth is great once the soup is getting simmering we can just hit it with a little more salt and pepper bring everything to a boil and then reduce your heat to medium pop the lid on your pot and let everything cook away for 15 or 20 minutes you really want to make sure that your cauliflower and your carrots are completely soft because our next step is actually going to be blending up this soup to do that we are going to of course turn the heat off on our stove and then we are going to use an immersion blender I love my immersion blender it comes in so handy in the kitchen in fact I probably should have added it to my kitchen essentials video that I heard two weeks ago because I loved it that that much you can use your immersion blender to get everything silky silky smooth and then it is ready to be enjoyed I love serving it with a dollop of coconut yogurt for some richness and some creaminess and a little bit of fresh cilantro guys this recipe is seriously good I hope you will give it a try if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because I love seeing your kitchen creations keep in mind that I've got loads of other great soup recipes on the channel you can check them out in my soup playlist and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe and hit that notification belt because there is lots more soup deliciousness with this game crap;['primeros']
tx1yTwRL5N0.json;We’re Adam and Joanne from inpiredtaste.net. and welcome to our kitchen. We’re making Chili Lime Shrimp Cups - a. fun party appetizer We shared this recipe on Inspired Taste a. few years back and it has become one of our more popular recipes. So they are really good. We take crispy baked wonton shells stuff arugula. in there, some lime sour cream, and a baked chili lime shrimp. It’s so good, so easy and the perfect party. appetizer. You are making me hungry. Let’s … we have to go make these. Yeah let’s go make them. EEEEEE … Le’t do it. Start by making the cups that will eventually. hold our shrimp. Wonton wrappers work great for this. Line them up then brush each wonton wrapper. with olive oil — a non-stick cooking spray or even melted butter works, too. Flip the wrappers, brush the second side with. oil then add a light sprinkle of salt. To achieve the shape we need, place each wonton. into a muffin cup — You will need to fold a side or two to make them fit. We’re using a mini muffin pan here, but. a regular muffin/cupcake pan can be used. The cups won’t be as tall, but will come. out just fine. Press the bottom of each wonton down so as. they bake the bottom of each cup stays flat. Bake the wonton cups until crisp — this. can take 5 to 10 minutes. Stay close while they bake, they can over-brown. easily. Once baked, transfer to a cooling rack then. move onto the shrimp. Start with peeled and deveined shrimp. Add some olive oil then add the zest of a. lime — a microplane works wonders for this. Add some chili powder — if you can find. it, we love the flavor of ancho chili powder. Then finish with salt and pepper. Spread the shrimp onto a baking sheet and. bake until opaque throughout, about 10 minutes. So we’ve made the shells and baked the shrimp. Now we need to make a lime sour cream. It’s easy and really delicious! Simply stir a little lime juice and salt into. the sour cream. Okay, it’s time to assemble! Grab a baked wonton shell, add some arugula. to the bottom, add a dollop of that lime sour cream. Then top everything with a big, juicy chili. lime shrimp. Arrange the shrimp cups on a plate with some. extra lime wedges. A spritz of lime is a good call. And that’s it — Chili Lime Shrimp Cups. for the win! Mmm, don’t those look so good. I think I’m going to steal one. Have one. And don’t forget you can get the full recipe. on Inspired Taste and if you liked what you saw, please subscribe. We have lot’s more videos to come. Oh my gosh … these are so good. See you next week. Bye.;['primeros']

vsRe4cLM71I.json;hi lovelies as the weather outside is getting cooler things in my kitchen are just heating up and today we are celebrating the arrival of soup season with one of my very favorite soups potato leek soup now this is one of those soups that i find people always tend to order at restaurants but are really reluctant to make at home themselves and it's such a shame because it's rich creamy perfectly comforting and it's so easy to make so if you've never worked with leeks before this is how they come usually in bunches of say three or four i'm using three in today's recipe and basically the first step here is just going to be cutting off this sort of dark green top so this part is not super delicious you can use it for things like soup stocks it's still got a really nice oniony flavor but it doesn't have a great texture so it's not something that you'd want to put in one of your recipes so we'll cut that off and then we're also just going to cut off the root end so that's the end that sort of holds it all together now what i like to do is to cut my leek in half like this and what you'll notice immediately is that it's got a lot of layers in here and what happens is that a lot of dirt can get stuck in those layers while your leeks are growing so it's important to wash your leeks really really well otherwise they can be a bit sandy or dirty and you definitely don't want a sandy texture in your soup so i like to just cut it into slices like this and then what i do is just place all of my leek in a colander and run it under some cold water to help get rid of any of that sandiness and that's it easy breezy we'll just get this into a colander and get it rinsed up so to get started for this soup i have got a nice big soup pot heating up over medium high heat on the stove to my soup pot i'm gonna go ahead and add some butter and i'm just going to let that butter melt down if you don't want to use butter in this recipe you could definitely use some oil here instead but i think butter adds a nice flavor to this now just as soon as that butter is nice and melted i'm going to go ahead and add my leeks to the pot you can see it's going to look like a lot of leek at first but what happens just like spinach or kale it's going to wilt down and sort of reduce in volume by about half i like to salt my leeks at this point while they're sort of working themselves out in that nice butter bath i also like to give this a little hit of pepper as well and i'm just going to let my leeks cook until they're nice and soft usually that takes about three to five minutes okay so my leeks have really reduced in volume they've softened up and they smell so delicious next it's time to add more grape flavor to this and we're going to do that with some garlic so i've got two large cloves of garlic that i've minced here add a little more garlic a little less garlic just depends on your preference once that garlic's become nice and fragrant it's time to get in here with our potatoes so i've got about three large yukon gold potatoes you could use white potatoes in this recipe totally up to you and i'm just going to get them right in the pot and then i'm going to cover them with some broth so i'm opting for chicken broth in this recipe because i think it really has the best flavor if you wanted to keep this vegetarian you definitely could using some veggie broth as instead that's totally up to you once my broth is in the pot i want to add even more grape flavor to this and i'm going to be doing that with some nice fresh herbs so i've got a few sprigs of fresh thyme headed in here as well as a fresh bay leaf if you only have dried herbs on hand you can definitely use those in a pinch not a problem at all i just prefer fresh because i think you get a really nice flavor and of course a nice aroma from them as well at this point we just want to bring this mixture to a nice rolling boil and as soon as it's reached to boil i'm going to go ahead and reduce my heat to medium pop a lid on my pot and let this simmer away for 10 to 15 minutes or just until my potatoes are really nice and tender just as soon as those potatoes are fully cooked through we can put the finishing touches on this really yummy suit so the first step is going to be removing the sprigs of thyme and the bay leaf from the pot because they have done their work next it's time to puree our soup to give it that really smooth velvety texture that leek and potato soup is so well known for i like to do this using an immersion blender now if you don't have an immersion blender it's definitely one of those kitchen tools that i think comes in really really handy you can find one pretty affordably on amazon i'll link one in the description box below if you don't have one on hand already and what i like to do is reduce the heat on my stove to low so it's no longer sort of bubbling and then i just go in with my immersion blender making sure to keep it fully submerged so that we're being safe and nothing splashes back and then just blend away you'll notice in about 30 seconds to a minute your soup is completely blended and what you're left with is just the most gorgeous texture now at this point just to finish this soup off i'm going to add a good splash of cream to this to make it even more rich and of course i'll season again with salt and pepper to taste seriously guys that is it this is one of those recipes that's so easy to prepare but the flavor is absolutely incredible and of course that creamy texture can't be beat i really hope you will give the soup a try for yourselves and if you do be sure to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because i always love seeing your kitchen creations this recipe like all of my recipes

surrounding area if you're looking for some good eats and you want to hire them I'll put their number up on the screen today or doing their homemade egg yolk ravioli it's outstanding we're gonna put a brown butter and sage sauce on top we're gonna start out with showing you a little bit about the pasta now they've rolled out their own pasta but I want to give you some options you can use a roller or you can roll it out by hand or you can use a wonton wrapper now you have to thin it out but they work beautifully saves a lot of time now we're gonna use some ricotta filling in these as well so we're gonna get Tina up to bat and put it together let's get to it if you're making your own pasta you'll just need 2 eggs 1 cup of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and if it's a little too dry just add a teaspoon of water whether you're making your own pasta or using a long Tong wrapper they must be rolled out paper thin I was pleasantly surprised how well the long Tong wrappers worked okay so we're going to be making ravioli and we're going to be piping the ricotta spinach mixture onto the ravioli pasta shells and then filling them with a raw egg yolk covering up and then boiling them so this is what we do we've got your ricotta and it's 1 cup of ricotta mixed in and we're going to add to that 3/4 of a cup of Parmesan as well get that in there and then I've taken 6 ounces of frozen spinach thawed it squeezed it dry and chopped it fine it's just easier to pipe that way once it's chopped fine and I'm gonna zest some lemon in there get the salt and pepper and the lemon is basically to your taste you can put as little or as much in as you like I prefer a lot of lemon myself and we're gonna add one egg to that mixture and you can add a little freshly grated nutmeg okay give it a good mix and then we're gonna put it in a piping bag or you can use the easiest thing a ziplock bag cut a little slit in the bottom and you're ready to pipe and that's it okay so now we've got our ricotta mixture in our piping bag in our freezer bag and we're just gonna snip the corner but we've got our fresh made pasta here ready to go with our pasta we use two sizes of rings one to mark out the diameter of the ravioli and a center ring just to mark our piping area for the ricotta mixture okay I'm gonna cut the bag now and we're gonna start piping and you want to keep in the circle and you want to go high enough so you have a so the egg sits right inside you may have to do a little fixing here with each one to get it the proper height you want to keep it tight as well so it's not so so big [Music] want to make sure you have an even space even height so when you your aide cracks in it doesn't overflow and of course the best thing for straining eggs are your fingers [Music] I'll place this on top and what you want to do is form a cup and totally seal the edges make sure you get all the air out [Music] now that our puss is all sealed we're gonna take our four inch ring that we started with to mark them and give them a little cut so we end up with her nice little raviolis there we go and there you have it ready for the water today's a unique day we have friends joining us thanks for joining us guys what a fun day well let's get back to the ravioli what we're doing now is just browning the butter I've got 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter here on the stove and when this gets nice and brown little crispy bits in it which actually gives it a nice nutty flavor we're gonna add some sage leaves I've got two three four sage leaves spirit depends on how much you like and sage can be quite strong so it's up to you how many wanna use I think I'll probably use it for today for a for ravioli and look now the butter is foaming up nicely it's got a foam up once come down and then it starts getting a little brown and it's slowing down the sizzling getting in this second foam here see how that's already turning nice and brown just another minute I'm gonna take it off the heat in the meantime whatever water boiling for a pasta that looks perfect right now I'm gonna take that off the heat and add our sage leaves and that can sit a couple minutes while our pasta boils very important to salt your water when making pasta don't be shy with it you could use up to a spoon in a in a shallow pot there's a season your pasta now we've dropped the raviolis in the water they only take about three minutes just like cooking a poached egg you'll know they're done when they start to float okay these are ready to come out now what I'm gonna do is just drain them on a paper towel to get the excess moisture off and then we'll be ready for plating all right we're gonna go to the plate now and there's our ravioli I'm gonna drizzle some brown butter and you can see how nicely that butter got toasted perfect we're gonna just do a light dusting of Parmesan cheese for decoration a nice little sage leaf to show what it's what's in the butter and we're good to go oh my I gotta show you this just slicing into one of these beautiful raviolis makes my mouth water well there's only one thing left to do and now our favorite time we get to try the goods oh my oh man beautiful flavor fresh pasta the ricotta cheese the brown butter outstanding you're gonna love it well thank you Mike and Tina for having us out for this wonderful recipe if you're ever looking for

WHU1e3tkHBM.json;hello friends and welcome back to my kitchen so today i've got three awesome and delicious recipes to share with y'all they're gonna be so easy and all three of these recipes have one common ingredient so we're making all of them with crescent roll dough this should be called him and cheese magic [Music] this is a special performance she has no idea what i'm about to do i have no clue if you like inchi ladas [Music] all right so we're gonna actually start with lunch because it is lunch time and monkey and i are so hungry after we make lunch we'll make our little it could be breakfast or dessert we're gonna call it dessert today and then tonight we'll make our dinner which is gonna be so good but for lunch i am the most excited because you all know how much i love my little hawaiian ham and cheese sandwiches y'all know i make them like all the time and they are the best well whenever i was thinking of like recipes for this video i was going obviously to buy my crescent rolls and i saw that they have the sweet hawaiian ones and i was like we're gonna make the ham and cheese sandwiches but in the crescent rolls we're gonna do like a big um like ham and cheese crescent roll ring and then we're gonna put our cheese in there i'm gonna like top it with garlic and ranch seasoning melted butter we're gonna make our little um whole grain mustard mayonnaise mixture to dip it in like y'all they're gonna be so good so first things first we need two rolls of the sweet hawaiian crescent rolls and we're just gonna layer them around um in a circle and kind of lay them on top so we have like a really good base and then we'll fill them with all the goodness and i always get questions about our pizza stone anytime we use it it is obviously very old and very used and loved um but it is a pampered chef pizza stone [Music] okay so two rolls was like the perfect amount so we have our ring put together and then over here i just got some um boar's head ham that we love sliced in the deli and i got about half a pound and i got it kind of thin like not shaved but not sandwich slice and then we have some baby swiss we're going to put on there and i'm going to go ahead and start up some of this colby jack so we'll lay this twist down then our ham and then we'll top it with some colby jack [Music] okay so now that everything is in there you're just gonna take your little tails of your crescent roll and just kind of pull it over and then you can kind of take what's left and tuck it over here to the side [Music] now to my melted butter i'm going to add in just a little bit of ranch seasoning and then a little bit of garlic powder we will stir that together and then i'm just going to lightly brush that all the way around the top [Music] okay so now into the oven at 375 for probably about 15 to 20 minutes but once it comes out i'll tell you the exact time it took [Music] those sandwiches smell so good y'all i cannot wait they only have about a minute left i'm going to go ahead and make our little condiment that we're going to dip them in so we're going to use a little bit of mayo stone ground mustard and i do recommend the stone ground mustard all those little mustard seeds in there that pop oh my gosh it's my favorite and then just a little splash of worcestershire and a little small sprinkle of ranch seasoning a little more sprinkle of ranch seasoning okay so we've got some mayo [Music] stone ground mustard beautiful this is actually i don't even think open that's new oh i love a good fresh brand new stone ground mustard oh me too doesn't that doesn't that just it's just beautiful it's just beautiful when it comes out i mean that's just the goodness is that your belly rumbling yeah i'm hungry oh my goodness could you hear that i wonder if you'll be able to hear that yeah okay a little splash of worcestershire and some ranch okay give this a little stir might need just another dash or two of the whoosh bunky i know you're gonna say it you see it every single time well it looks a little it looks a little thick you know oh thick you wanna taste it [Music] they look perfect oh my goodness monkey [Music] anticipation is killing me this might be one of your best lunches ever it stands a chance to be right up there in the top five and i'm so interested to see how i like this versus using the king's hawaiian rolls are they um they're sweet hawaiian sweet hawaiian crescent rolls yes i'm liking i'm liking what we got going on here boo i'm liking it okay i can't hardly stand to let this thing cool off i think we gotta let it sit for at least like two more minutes oh my goodness okay are we ready i'm ready let me just have where i want to go in let's go in over here [Music] and do you want like us oh no no come on now you want me to go all the way over here yes please trying to give me one little i was basically pressing around i was going to cut more than one dude see you don't have to come out club again right yeah oh my gosh he's gonna be so good we have our little dipping sauce this is so nice and fancy this is like ham and cheese delight right here that's what we should call this this is ham and cheese delight that is the new name for this okay oh my goodness let me get closer to you and see this thing let's do a little wow y'all look at that there there are no words did you dip yours i haven't dipped it yet i'm just impressed with how well this like holds together and all that you know [Music] friends this should be called ham and cheese magic it's ham and cheese delights though i know monkey but this is like magnificently delightfully incredibly tasty so do you think this is better i almost than the rolls i almost like it better because that crescent roll is like so flaky and just like melts in your mouth yeah oh my gosh i like it i love it get a little pickle here refresh the palette this is so good oh man okay i'm going to clean up finish eating and then we will get started on our second recipe okay so before we jump into this second recipe i do want to take a quick minute and thank ruggable for sponsoring today's video y'all i am in love with my new rug the colors in there match our chairs in the sunroom so perfect it looks amazing and i'm so thankful that my ruggable is washable because i already spilled my coffee on there so let me show you how easy the assembly is because it has like the non-slip grip pad that you lay down and then you literally can just place your rug on top it pulls up so easily to wash thank goodness so let me show it to you it is so beautiful and tell you a little bit more about ruggable so i have the cameron ivory opal rug in the 6x9 and y'all it is seriously stunning it is such a beautiful rug and something that i love about ruggable is that all of their rug covers are interchangeable they are super easy to swap out whenever you want and they don't slip they stay very secure right in place because you have that non-slip rug pad which is awesome and that rug pad is actually made from 95 recyclable material i was so upset whenever i spilled my coffee but thank goodness my rug cover is machine washable it's spill and stain resistant and it's safe for babies your pets even your clumsy husbands or you if you're clumsy like i am and what i love about it is that it is so lightweight y'all pulling this thing up was a breeze i could easily just put it in the washing machine and in the dryer it comes out just perfect no coffee stain all is well so that's the tea or coffee i should say oh my ruggable is everyone's favorite rug so be sure you head down to my description box click that link and use my promo code to save 10 off your purchase with ruggable okay so now let's get started on this next recipe so of course you will need some crescent rolls some pecans you don't have to put these in there but i think the crunch will be really nice you'll also need just a little bit of brown sugar and some apple pie spice you will also need a granny smith apple and then one more ingredient that is also optional is some caramel drizzle this one is a salted caramel which oh my gosh it's so good i think i'm going to drizzle this on top once they come out of the oven but these are going to be super simple to make a great little breakfast or dessert they're going to be so delicious [Music] okay so to get started on our little apple pie bites i just have some melted butter right here and i'm gonna toss my sliced apples into the melted butter and just kind of stir those around until they're nice and coated [Music] and then next i'm going to take my brown sugar i'm going to add a little bit of my apple spice to this and give it a good stir [Music] [Music] okay so now i'm taking my brown sugar and apple pie spice mixture i'm just going to sprinkle this right on top of each one [Music] then we're going to take our chopped pecans and just sprinkle a few of those on as well [Music] okay so once you have them wrapped up you're going to take your leftover melted butter you're going to brush this on the top and then we're going to sprinkle them with a little bit more of that apple pie spice [Music] okay into the oven at 375 for about 10 to 12 minutes [Music] okay and for the best part this caramel drizzle oh my gosh these are going to be amazing and i even have some cookie dough ice cream because why not i mean that looks like a dessert i want to eat i know you want a bite of that like right now hand it on over babe hand it on over i'm gonna let you get a bite first but then i want to bite you i can feel the warmth under in my on my hand under the plate yes handheld little baked apple pie bites yeah oh well i'm liking the texture so far [Music] wow that's really good i'm gonna get into the center here okay and then take a little bite with some ice cream yeah we didn't have any vanilla so i felt like the chocolate chip cookie dough would be just fine i ate all of the vanilla ice cream actually i figured this probably won't hurt anything though yep it's delicious good yeah this is good and y'all these are so simple to make okay so we are back in the kitchen it's actually the next day monkey and i are having another amazing lunch if you hear daisy may she's over here begging for some chicken and some cheese but we are gonna make the easiest most yummiest little chicken enchiladas using our crescent rolls we ended up having um frozen chicken nuggets and french fries for dinner last night we were trying to clean our house and do all this stuff and so we ended up not having time to cook my little makeshift chick-fil-a was good air the air fryer came to the rescue yeah it was actually a really good dinner it was very good dinner wasn't it yeah i loved it yes so but we're gonna have a really yummy lunch so let me show you how we're going to assemble these so i already have all of my chicken cut up and i just used a rotisserie chicken to make it even more simple and then i have some shredded sharp cheddar cheese here and i have a little bit of this colby jack that we used yesterday so i'll just kind of combine the two you're gonna need one can of crescent rolls a little bit of enchilada sauce and then i'm also going to add some little green chilies to ours you don't have to use these but i think it'll give like a little bit of extra flavor in there so i'm going to go ahead and get my chicken in our bowl top it with our cheese enchilada sauce and chili's and then give that a good stir [Music] okay so we've got this all mixed together and you do want to save just a little bit of your enchilada sauce because we're going to top it with that after it comes out of the oven now we're going to take our crescent rolls and we are going to make four rectangles out of them so you'll lay them out half it and then half each half again perforations are so helpful so helpful and then you're just going to take this so then we'll just kind of pinch these little seams together [Music] okay now to each of our little rectangles we're just going to add as much filling as you can get in there without stuffing it too full because we're going to roll them up just like enchiladas now which way are you rolling these things i don't know what should i do well i don't think it's going to roll up the way you oh my heavens is this too much yeah come on now let's try but which way do you roll it oh is that kind of stretch it a little smush you see oh yeah this will be just fine and then stretch it a little and seal the deal seal the dill see it's gonna be just fine perfect now put this in our baking dish and do the other three i was going to say two you could also put like all black olives in here if you wanted to or even um like some ratel if you drained it you can kind of add in here whatever you like you all know i'm like kid friendly recipes over here i was actually thinking and liking just using a can of patel instead of like green chilies because that's got you a little tomato like all the all the good flavor in there i almost used a can of um or a tail but then i realized we had this green chili so i was like might as well use those um but you can kind of add whatever you like in your chicken enchiladas into the mixture i wasn't thinking that things were gonna uh you're doubting me i'd yeah you always are doubting maybe prove me wrong prove me wrong i always prove you wrong but the way that these come out of the oven prove me wrong wow you you've really gotten the hang of this now oh yeah i've lost my job as the uh crescent roll person okay last one you know i twisted the pumpkin oh yeah you did you did so good i did the pumpkin twisting and i'm stuffing these things like pretty full we're gonna take this pop it in the oven at 375 for like 20 minutes then we're going to take them out sprinkle some cheese put them back in there for a couple minutes take them out and then just drizzle some more enchilada sauce and then put them back in no that's it or you'll put it back in i think i won't put them back in just like for a minute it's going to warm up kind of you know yeah do its thing in there this is like a very easy dinner recipe like if you have a night really busy and you need to get dinner on the table quick this is so simple especially using the rotisserie chicken the prep time is minimal yes [Music] okay what you're thinking it looks yummy doesn't it does look very yummy it looks so good and i left them in just a few extra minutes to make sure they were very well done for you i can tell i'm really liking this uh your little crust yeah that's looking good there yes okay i cannot wait green chili poking out over here yes [Music] i honestly can't wait for the sour cream yeah let's try it with all this sauce i just smell a little bite real fast how about sour cream first store what do you say boo that is good for real like you don't so you don't get regular enchiladas when we go out to eat not much never so is this gonna this is very good there's a little bit of heat in there it'll surprise you that green chili is the green chili i think that that that green chicken enchilada salt is like a little bit spicy too yes yeah well dip that is really good it's delicious i'm kind of shocked i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of shocked i was very suspect of the crescent roll giving me what i needed as far as that but it's almost like it's it's more you know what it kind of reminds me of what chimichanga oh yes yes i can see that you know the good old deep fried and yes this is delish i gotta tell you okay tell me are you ready yeah all right this is a special performance okay okay she has no idea what i'm about to do i have no clue all right i thought of this a little bit ago all right here goes [Music] i can't are you ready okay ready i'm ready if you like enchiladas and eating cheese every day if you like having a good time [Music] oh no no if you like hanging with the bonkies then just push play oh my gosh this is the best thing ever yeah i'm a little embarrassed you came up with this yeah i did actually yeah i'm a little my face is probably super real your face is beat red yeah buddy this is beautiful i actually have like you know how when you like get real nervous you kind of lose feeling in your legs that that has even happened but i just wanted everybody out there to enjoy that we enjoyed it so much thank you so much yeah so oh that is so funny i'm not known for my singing but uh i can't knock the love and i'm crying over here i mean you know if you can't make fun of yourself and embarrass yourself then what are you doing this is true oh man that was hilarious but i couldn't help but i was sitting there and like i was thinking like you know the the pina coladas on my enchiladas i don't know how you come up with this stuff but that little head of yours oh cool it's good now there's there's some uh there's some mice up there turning the wheels this is actually really good it's delish i almost think it's better than when we made these at home like using tortillas i agree it's it's really that's really good i would personally i think doing the rotel thing that we mentioned would probably be really good too because it'll give you some tomato and stuff in there as well yes maybe is there onion in our hotel let me just finish eating that but um the green chilies though were really good as well yes i literally cannot believe you just busted out in song like i am dead right now okay i'm gonna go have some lunch with this sinking handsome man over here but i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with us today don't forget to check out rockable down below in my description box if you're new we'd love

xJRX_l8atM4.json;[Music] this week on in the kitchen with pete we're making a delicious simple creamy tomato soup i had a hankering for some nice creamy tomato soup so i came up with this recipe i'm going to be using some chicken stock vegetable stock is great as well half and half cream san marzano tomatoes garlic onions some herbs and carrots now why the carrots often in tomato soups they add sugar amongst many other soups it sweetens it up for sure and gets rid of some of that acidity in the tomatoes but the carrots do just as well and i'm no nutritionist but i gotta think carrots are better for you than sugar just saying anyways let's get over the stove and get cooking peel two large carrots and then using a box grater look for the teardrop holes i'll use the smaller ones and we'll grate that up and set that aside in a pot on medium heat we're going to add one teaspoon of each butter and olive oil we'll add one cup of white onions finely diced just to soften them up about five minutes clear out a little spot in the bottom of the pan and add a drizzle of olive oil then we're going to add two large cloves of garlic finely diced stir that in and then let's add some more herbs we're going to add a half a teaspoon of italian seasoning and a half a teaspoon of ground rosemary stir it in for about a minute to let it release all those flavors and aromas now don't skimp on this use san marzano tomatoes whole tomatoes 28 ounces we'll add that to our pot and then we're going to mash that up i'll use my handy tool here that's well it's meant to be used for cooking ground beef but i find it perfect for this process as well now we'll stir in five fresh chopped basil leaves fresh is the best way folks dried basil just won't give you the same flavor we'll stir in our carrots and then we'll add our chicken broth one and a half cups or vegetable broth will work as well turn it up to high heat and bring it to a boil reduce the heat to low cover it and let it simmer for 40 minutes stir it occasionally add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and now it's time to blend it i'm using my immersion blender these work very well for this process you can use a stand up blender as well and bring that to a nice smooth consistency [Music] there we go it's looking nice and smooth now and now we're gonna add some half and half cream make sure it's at room temperature when you add this and then gently stir that in and you'll see how nice and silky it becomes [Music] give it a final check for salt and pepper mmm i think that's just perfect it's time to serve it up oh my doesn't that look delicious now here's the way i like it i like to add a couple little croutons just sprinkle those on top or maybe you'd like a dollop of sour cream i'm gonna top mine with a little fresh grated parmesan oh yeah you're gonna love it i'll garnish that with a little bit of fresh basil on top it's time to come to the table another simple and delicious recipe i got lots more of them hit that little red subscribe button and you'll get notified every time i put up a new video well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pete until next time see ya [Music] you;['primeros']
xKnJooz6RuE.json;[Music] that might be a little much no no never have enough um yes please a mountain of sausage and cheese in a biscuit yeah i'll take it [Music] i think we've gone from like good to great to greatest [Music] hello wesley friends and welcome back to my kitchen i am so excited to be in the kitchen today and make some delicious super easy holiday appetizer recipes with y'all you loved this video last year so i thought it'd be fun to do it again and i have three new recipes that y'all are going to love monkey and i are actually going to have them for dinner tonight so as soon as he gets off work he's gonna come downstairs and we're gonna whip up all of the goodness but i'm gonna go ahead and get this first recipe started because it does take a little bit longer to bake in the oven and this first recipe is going to be some little individual baked potato bites that has my name written all over it if you invite me to a party and you have these i'm your girl okay so to get started on these i have three russet potatoes here depending on how many you're making is how many you will use since it's just monkey and i have a dinner tonight i'm just gonna do these three and i've already washed and dried them and then i'm just going to take my knife and cut them kind of into like one i guess it's one inch or half inch little discs so basically this thickness just like this [Music] okay i'm actually not even gonna use this one because i feel like for monkey and i this is plenty so i'm just gonna put these on a baking dish um just kind of like on their side here and then i'm gonna brush them with a little bit of oil [Music] okay so now that i have oiled them on both sides at this point you can season them with salt and pepper but i'm not gonna season them with salt and pepper because i'm gonna take it up a notch so let me show you what i'm gonna use to season these i'm gonna use some of my auntie no-no's everything seasoning and y'all i am so so excited because guess what auntie no-no's is sponsoring today's video and i am the most excited for this y'all know mandy is one of my very best friends and i have heard her rave about these seasonings for such a long time so of course i had to try them and they are so good like did not disappoint they are amazing we literally use them on everything so i'm gonna flip you around we're gonna season these and i'm gonna tell you guys a little bit more about auntie no nose auntie no nose has three delicious seasonings all of which are gluten-free vegan-friendly non-gmo kosher and no msg this everything seasoning literally we put it on everything it is so good it's a one and done custom blend of savory spices that brings out the zest in whatever you put it on they also have the seafood seasoning and the firecracker sea salt which is one of my favorites and right now you can actually get all three in their savory sampler gift box this would be an awesome gift for that person in your life who loves to cook or grill so y'all know that we love a little bit of heat in our food and this firecracker sea salt seasoning is so good we've actually put this on popcorn it was delicious we put this on chicken wings i've added this to my pasta i mean like chicken alfredo and a little bit of this to kind of give it a little kick so so good we love this one and then this auntie no nose seafood seasoning bee actually used on some salmon the other night and he was raving about it he said it was so good like some of the best seasoning he's ever had for seafood so he actually got some shrimp and we're gonna make that tonight to go along with our appetizers and of course we'll use our auntie no-no's seafood seasoning on that as well this seafood seasoning has notes of lemon paprika and mustard which bring a sweet and savory kick to fish or any dish and i'm telling y'all bee can not get enough of this one he loves it and this is also a great seasoning if you're wanting to blacken something if you want to try any of these antino seasonings and you should you should get all three because they're so good i say try that savory sampler gift box it's the best way to go there will be a link down below in my description box for you guys and you can also use my discount code which is jessica10 i'll put it right here on the screen but be sure you head down there click that link and go check out all of these seasonings you will love them okay these are going into the oven at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes okay i don't know about y'all but you cannot have a baked potato without some bacon so while those are in the oven i'm gonna go ahead and fry up a couple pieces of bacon which we'll crumble and put on top and of course we're gonna top it with lots of sharp cheddar cheese and then i actually have another recipe that also calls for cheddar cheese so i'm just gonna go ahead and shred up a ton of it so we'll have it for our next recipe too so that's what i'm gonna do while those are cooking [Music] we got chef funky in here now okay so bacon is done and then with this bacon grease i'm gonna take my little yes yes okay my spatula thing and i'm just gonna kind of drizzle a little bit of this bacon grease on top of our potatoes and then we'll pop them back in the oven for just like five more minutes i know did you already flip those once no should we we'll go ahead i'll go ahead and just grease up both sides slightly yeah yeah we need to give them a turn honey yeah i agree they already look so good okay let's turn them did you get them all yeah we can do this other side too oh look at that that's what i'm talking about are they hot yeah a little let me let me help you out sug these are gonna be so good i know uh potatoes isn't your favorite thing uh-huh but it's my favorite thing well these are looking like they're gonna be uh pretty nice pretty nice [Music] these are full flavored potatoes okay back in the oven five minutes and then we'll bring them out and top them with our bacon and cheese and then cook them for five more minutes cheese cheese cheese louise i haven't seen that one that's why i just um grated all that cheese wow that's that's a lot of cheeseburger well it's for another recipe too okay we need to chop this up into bite-sized pieces [Music] okay so it has been the five minutes y'all these just look it smells so good we have our bacon over here we're gonna top them with some green onions or top monkeys with that once they're completely done and then i also have my cheese and we will dump them dump them dunk them in some sour cream as well like oh my gosh these are gonna be so good so to each of these we're just gonna take like a little bit of bacon for each one and then a little bit of cheese as well [Music] okay back into the oven for just five more minutes and then these will be done we'll top them with the green onion the sour cream oh my goodness i cannot wait can i just put a little pile of cheese on the side here oh gosh yes let's just do that you know that's gonna be good slide you over a little bit maybe hold on you know i thought to myself that they should be called what cheesy scallion potato medallions dude that is so good thank you funky that is genius i i thought they deserved a good name you know that is a great name there we go oh my god oh wow oh yeah oh my goodness y'all know how much we love some cheese i love some potato i love some bacon like are you kidding me and then and then you just pow oh you're like no you didn't just do that these are about to be delish that's hot are you gonna scrape that up and just like eat it i'm probably gonna let it uh you know it's gonna like harden just slightly yeah and then i'll pop it up it's going to be like a like a chip or cheese chip [Music] now because we have this kind of sour cream where i can just squeeze it i'm gonna put like a tiny little dollop on there just to kind of make them look really cute but you could also just put some sour cream in a little dish on the side for people to like dip it in [Music] they're still a little bit hot they're not that hot oh yeah coming from smite who doesn't even really like potatoes this is good y'all this is a must try recipe like um you know when you go to a restaurant you order potato skins this is like that but so much better because it's less potatoey because it's like thinner you know and just like all the goodness oh my gosh their own these are like ridiculously good i could literally eat 20 of these for myself you don't know what you're missing out life without the green onion legit probably my favorite appetizer i've ever made very easy to do they take a little bit of time to like bake in the oven but they're so simple they have so much flavor that anti-no no seasoning on there i'm telling y'all it's perfection like that seasoning is good on everything i even thought about putting a little bit of the firecracker on here just to give it like a kick but these are so delicious they're great yes [Music] okay so now i'm gonna get started on this second recipe and i honestly don't even know how it could top the first recipe because that was so good and by the way you could also dip those in ranch dressing and that would be even as delicious as the sour cream but anyway i went ahead and brown up some sausage and y'all know like my famous recipe um the appetizer i always make that's like the crescent rolls sausage and cream cheese mixture and then the crescent rolls on top you know how everyone is like obsessed with that recipe well this is very similar but kind of a new spin on it and you know how i make my bacon and cheese bites this is kind of like a mix between my bacon and cheese bites and my sausage and cream cheese casserole so let me just tell you i know it's gonna be out of this world so good so i have my sausage browned up here to this i'm gonna add in some cream cheese a dash of worcestershire and then some shredded cheddar cheese and i of course i'm kind of like halfing this again just because it's me and bunky but i will leave the full recipe down in my description box for you guys but you would use like a full thing of sausage i only did about half of it so i'm gonna go ahead and mix this all together and then i'll show you what we're gonna do next [Music] and you do want to let your cream cheese like sit out and come to room temperature so it's a lot easier to stir in i did not let mine sit out long enough okay i got some funky power in there and he helped me stir it up the rest of the way so as long as it is like good and combined this is good to go so next you're going to get a muffin tin pan is how you call this yeah why does that sound weird muffin tin pan muffin pan whatever muffin pan and then you're gonna get some biscuits and i always use a layer of biscuits um i think it would be really good in this recipe just to kind of pull in half that way it's not too biscuity too doughy you know what i mean so i'm just going to pull each one in half place it in the bottom of my muffin pan and then put a little bit of this mixture on top is this not going to be so stinking delicious so you're putting half a biscuit in each one of these little holes you just like literally lay it in there because my bacon and cheese bites you know how like they're smaller little mini muffins yeah this is like the big size regular muffin it's gonna be so good y'all [Music] for instance here's my biscuit i am just going to literally oh do half yeah and then just sit that down in there all right you see you're making this look way too easy it's so easy [Music] okay and then to that you're just going to add your mixture right on top now that might be a little much no no never have enough oh no you think that's good well this one you were a little bit aggressive this one much better oh yep i just want a little bit more you know what this is oh my gosh when you're like over filling these things it's gonna be no it's been perfect you know what this kind of reminds me of i don't know what those um my sausage muffins that i make you know that maybe yeah i already thought about that yeah kind of like it's an easier way to do it yeah it's uh so simple it's just minus eggs and bisquick whoops i'm making a mess yeah you were doing so good now we're gonna have burnt crunchy spots right there do you do you need to like smush them out a little bit to bring them all the way up around the edges or you don't have to why from what i can tell from the recipe that i saw you just like literally lay it in there um why don't you just throw that in in one of those tins and just good idea just do it okay yeah leave the whole thing in there okay um okay so these are going to go into the oven at 375 just whatever the can of your biscuits say i'm pretty sure they all say 3.75 and it'll probably be in there for like 13 to 15 minutes but we'll keep an eye on it and i'll tell you guys the exact time once they're done now while those are in there i'm going to claim the kitchen we are not going to make our third recipe tonight we're going to make it in the morning and we are actually leaving to go camping tomorrow we're so excited you're like on vacation yep my vacation starts now it starts because you've been helping me in the kitchen um well after we eat those but anyway um well that's my dessert that's your dessert that's my prize yes that's my reward that's my breakfast tomorrow morning that's breakfast that's what's gonna say so we're going camping tomorrow morning or we're gonna leave tomorrow during lunchtime so i'm gonna take those with us and we can have that for breakfast tomorrow and then our third appetizer that we're gonna make in the morning we can take those and just have like all weekend to snack on they're gonna be scrumptious so anyway after we make those they're poppable people they're poppable what's that mean pop it in your mouth and eat it oh yes it's just yes um anyway we'll make the other one tomorrow morning cause it's getting late and we can't eat you know three full recipes no shrimp i can only eat but so much yeah i need to stop snacking on this cheese okay it's been 13 minutes and i think they're pretty much done i mean what have you created here i mean this looks so good um yes please a mountain of sausage and cheese in a biscuit yeah yeah i'll take it here's the first one that you made maybe i did i think i did stuff that one a little too much you know i was thinking too what like for you i could literally put like uh dice up like a green bell pepper super finely and put that in there or even like onions you would love that yeah this would be good with probably uh some green and red bell pepper in it oh for christmas it'd be so offensive you see what i did there my poor bunkie he sounds like he's getting sick again i don't know about my throat i hope you're not let's get these out so they can um cool cool and then like stop cooking the time has come it is finally time to taste test this deliciousness you want to split one with me yeah yeah you're breaking that in half i mean this just looks so good you can't hand this to me fast enough i think it's kind of hot still [Music] are you all smiles up there yes oh wow [Music] you know what i think is really important here what the worcestershire mm-hmm that i i'm i'm tasting a little bit of the worcestershire in there it gives it like a nice depth of flavor in there yeah um like a richness then you have like that flaky fluffy biscuit oh my gosh i'm actually pleasantly surprised with how well the biscuit still cooked and it was exactly 13 minutes by the way these are delicious these are really good yeah these would even be great for like a breakfast for your kiddos or like breakfast appetizer or whatever it's a great recipe so like i told you guys i'm gonna go ahead and get cleaned up and then we'll meet you back here in the morning to make our third and final recipe that's going to be as equally as delicious as these two have already been and then the one camp and then we're going camping we're so excited i made another one another one too well i guess we're really only having one each because we split the first one yeah oh my gosh oh there we go do y'all see that it's just cheesy ooey gooey goodness okay good morning we got our coffee i have everything laid out here to make this recipe we're going to call these like a little brie balm i think they are going to be delicious so first things first is you're going to need a can of crescent rolls if you want to get the one that's like a dough sheet that already that doesn't have any seams by all means i just already had these in the fridge so i'm going to use them but first thing you want to do is roll this out and then pinch all of your little seams together um the actual recipe says to cut this into 24 even pieces but since again it's just me and monkey i'm not going to be too precise unless you want to do the math oh i'm going to be precise oh okay i'm gonna let monkey cut our crescent roll dough since you know he's way more precise than me but basically we are just going to cut little teeny even bite size squares let's see so we got so we're going to go thirds that's way too small wait a minute i shouldn't have done that hold on we need there's four six oh yeah we should have gone this way we'll we'll we'll do this half properly how about that okay this is if we don't have it you know the exact amount okay so now that we have our crescent rolls cut into little bite size pieces you're just going to take a mini muffin tin pan and i am going to go ahead and lightly spray it so that they don't stick and then we'll kind of press down our little um crescent roll and then we're going to cut our brie into bite-sized pieces as well and we'll put a little piece of this brie inside each one and then i'll show you guys the rest of the ingredients [Music] okay so now that we have our brie in there we're just going to take a little bit of apricot preserves and put on top of it you could also do like fig or raspberry kind of like whatever jam you want i just love apricot especially with brie and then we're gonna also put some chopped pecans on there so you're just gonna take a little spoonful and put like a little dollop on top of each one [Music] okay so next we are just going to top those with a little bit of these chopped pecans and then a little bit of flaky sea salt the salt is going to take it over the top [Music] okay and that is it these are going into the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes okay these are out of the oven y'all they look so good i just have them on my cute little christmas spode um christmas tree little platter and then i left two over here on my cooling rack for monkey and i to taste test i am so excited to try these i do want to tell you when they come out of the oven they kind of look messy but once i got them out of the um pan they were perfectly fine cheers oh my goodness whoa this is so good what are you laughing about i'm trying to find my words to describe this because it's like ridiculous the first little thing i tasted was the pecans and then a little bit of the sweetness from that apricot but then the brie comes in at the back the brie is so warm and melty and like oh my gosh it really is i think we've gone from like good to great to greatest it's so good like these things are worth totally worth making like you cannot just eat one you would eat like a hundred because they're so good i try to tell you we need to make all 24. i'll try to tell you and i love that it's just a tiny little bite oh my gosh y'all the ones are crucial we could do walnuts too maybe the pink eyes give it daisy may want some they give it just like a um acid pink i think a little nuttiness and crunch and you could um start talking with my mouth full hang on and for like presentation you could put some like rosemary little sprigs on there to make it look even more festive and fun but y'all have to make these they are scrumptious and they were super simple to make anyway we're gonna go keep stuff in our faces these things are so good breakfast of champions here yeah we're not gonna have any to take with us but anyway i love you guys thank you for

YXkhgRApHLc.json;hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious that's my motto and today we'll be following that the star of the show is crab stuffed mushrooms delicious as an appetizer I'll be using some cremini mushrooms the small little brown ones like this conversely if you want to make this a Maine you can use the big portobello mushrooms put more stuffing into it and have that as a Maine to start out with your mushrooms you want to pop the stems off you'll see some recipes out there that use the stems back into their filling I however will put these aside maybe tomorrow I'll make myself a mushroom omelet but I think there's enough mushroom flavor in here so you pop these off and if you want to get a little more room in there you can use a spoon go around the edge and make a little extra room for your stuffing so let's get to the stuffing so in a bowl we will mix 1 cup of shredded cheese it's a Italian mixture of mozzarella parmesan Romano and provolone you can find these already mixed up and shredded in bags at your local grocery then we're going to put in 3 tablespoons of cream cheese [Music] and then six ounces of crab this was just right out of a can a tablespoon of parsley some finely diced spring onions when I say finely diced I mean like that very finely diced you don't want big clumps of onions in your mixture two tablespoons of breadcrumbs and a teaspoon of dill and one or two finely diced garlic cloves [Music] and I'm gonna season it with some Old Bay seasoning season it to your liking and we'll put another little doubt of that when we when we stuff the mushrooms so we'll mix this up all real well take your time when you're mixing this up you want to get it well mixed to it like like a paste and then we'll start stuffing our muck [Music] okay I've got a couple more to stuff when you're stuffing these be generous with your stuffing you want to get that thing plump right up over the top like so there's enough stuffing here to do about 12 to 15 mushrooms just like so [Music] okay let's get these in the oven I'm using a tin full pan easy cleanup little double Avoyelles spread it around with a paper towel just to prevent any sticky ovens preheated at 375 we'll pop it in there for about 20 minutes a little more obey seasoning just for little extra flavor on top you can cook these on the barbecue as well 375 medium to high heat on the top shelf close the lid 15 20 minutes they're done let's get these in the oven and there they are don't they look delicious oh boy my favorite time I get to try the goods they have like a nice little crust on them that's what you're looking for hmm oh my cheesy gooey gooey and crab you can't feed it your friends and family will love them in fact I'm gonna go share these with my neighbors don't forget to subscribe to my video you'll get notified every Monday when I put out a new one thanks for visiting in the kitchen with Pete until next time [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music];['primeros']

happy that you are here come join us in the kitchen today get cozy and comfy we're gonna have a lot of fun and make all kinds of yummy goodness so let's get to cooking okay so for this first one we are making a Cheesy taco dip in the crock pot y'all already know this is gonna be so good and the best part about this one is there's only five ingredients okay so of course you're gonna need your crock pot and I'm just using my little mini baby once a day you're also gonna need a jar of salsa whichever one is your favorite will work and then you're gonna need some ground beef taco seasoning some cream cheese and then some velveet and of course I'm not using this entire thing I'll probably only use like half of it but you'll need the Velveeta and to get started we're going to go ahead and just Brown our beef [Music] so once you've got your ground beef cooked and drained go ahead and add that to your crock pot and I did go ahead and lightly grease this by the way so next we're going to add in one packet of taco seasoning now we're going to add in our salsa I'm only doing half a block of cream cheese if you want to put the entire Block in there by all means and last but not least is our Velveeta [Music] and give this a good stir I probably should have stirred that taco seasoning into that meat before I put all this cheese in here but you live and you learn okay so I have my crock pot on high I'm gonna pop a lid on here and it will cook for about two to three hours okay so it's been about an hour let's check on this dip it is bubbling away in here and y'all it smells so good oh my gosh do you see this cheesy creamy goodness wow I could like take a deep dive into this okay I'm gonna give it like 30 more minutes and it'll probably be about done okay I'm ready I've got my chips I am ecstatic to try this dip I know it's gonna be so good but you can downstairs and he's like what is this goodness about to eat I'm like cheesy taco dip and he said oh yeah I need some of that like right now so let's taste test this okay first let's just like check in on this goodness and give it a stir oh my gosh do you see this do you see the magic this is what you call Magic blend that magic up wow like y'all I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful sight and I think it's such a good change up to like everyone's normal like sausage cheese dip Rotel yeah it's like a good cheesy dip but different yeah you just keep talking about it and maybe I'll get to try it at some point how about it I'm Gonna Let You Go first oh fun the perfect vessel here I got this Scoops because I know I was making this dip and I was like you have to have a Scoops you know oh yeah oh yep [Music] [Laughter] that is very good I can't wait to try it so much different than your standard sausage Rotel cheese dip can you taste the taco seasoning in there oh those were for me but oh my goodness I just can't get up for the beauty of it yeah I don't think you can really see the actual color of it too well on the camera oh wow they're salsa in there too that is legit that's legit oh my gosh wow that is awesome wow well I know it's not eating for dinner tonight yeah I will literally like I'm not you know what pairs well with this what sweet tea flavor this dip is incredible like you can taste that taco seasoning but it's almost like intensified and that salsa y'all you 100 hands down have to make this recipe you will thank me I promise and your family will it is so good okay so for these next two recipes it is all about cheesy goodness and actually one of you guys sent me this first recipe you were like you gotta make this and I said you are right this is gonna be so much fun and so cute we are going to make a pumpkin cheese ball and there are so many different variations of ways that you can do this but let me show you what I'm going to put in mine all right so I've got my cream cheese and this has been sitting out for a little while because you want it to be room temperature so it's really easy to stir everything in and get it nice and combined I'm gonna add a little bit of chopped jalapeno to mine if you don't like spice of course you can leave that out and then I did go ahead and trade my cheese and I use like the little smaller attachment that has like thinner shreds because I think this is what's going to make our pumpkin look really good so I have all of my cheddar cheese there I have some real bacon pieces some ranch seasoning Auntie no nose and some Parmesan now you could do like Pome Mentos in here or like spinach and artichokes and kind of make like an artichoke spinach cheese ball you could do lump crab meat olives like whatever your hearts desire you guys know these are just like our favorite things so we're gonna go ahead and get all of this in our bowl and get it combined [Music] and by the way I will show you how we're going to actually make this look like a pumpkin trust the process okay so I'm only using a very little bit of jalapeno and I basically minced it like I cut it as small as I possibly could and I'm just doing a little bit because I don't want it to be overpowering but I want just like that little bit of kick in there so we're going to toss that in and then I'm gonna do like half of this cheese inside the cheese ball then we're going to cover it with the rest of the cheese hence making it look like a pumpkin laughs [Music] Hey listen sometimes you just gotta get in there with your hands to work okay so here's where this gets really fun we're gonna take our cheese ball and put it on a plate and put all of that extra cheese around it cover it so that it looks orange like a pumpkin and I'm going to show you how we're going to make it look even more like a pumpkin let me take my rings off keep it clean keep it clean keep it clean okay okay make sure it's like nice and round a good little perfect size ball and then just start pressing this extra cheese into it [Music] once you've got your cheese ball covered in your extra cheese we're gonna take our plastic wrap and we're going to cover this pumpkin and then we are going to take some string and make little indentions so it really looks like a pumpkin okay so take your cheese ball put it in the center of your plastic wrap and just kind of wrap it up nice and tight [Music] and then now for the fun part you are going to take rubber bands hair ties don't worry these are brand new never been used string twine whatever you have and we are going to wrap this while it sits up in the fridge so that there's like little indentions just like a pumpkin if you have a string you probably want something a little bit thinner than this that's why I'm not using this twine and you would just like start underneath let me start and show you kind of like wrap around keep going underneath wrap you get the picture and then you would sit in the fridge like this but I am going to use hair ties Maybe [Music] okay just like so so I'm gonna pop this in the fridge for about four hours now once we take that out in a couple of hours it is still not done we have finishing touches it is going to be so adorable and if you are having a party this is like the perfect thing to add to your table to make it look really festive but also delicious and it's just going to add so much character to like your little tablescape so anyway while that is in the fridge we're gonna go ahead and get started on this third recipe and let me just tell you I feel like I may have saved the best for last although I don't even know if I can say that because yesterday that dip was so good we're making another dip and I think this one is going to be equally as delicious so we are making a Korean corn cheese dip friends oh my goodness it's going to be so good and this is all of the ingredients you need like could not be more simple so of course fresh corn I am going to go ahead and just kind of cut this off of the cob you'll need some mozzarella some mayo some green onion salt and pepper so I'm going to do pepper and little into your nose just to give it a little extra flavor and then some sugar that is it so let me go ahead and get this corn prepped and then we'll kind of put everything together [Music] okay so I've got all my corn in my bowl and I did three pieces of corn and then to this I'm gonna add some sugar of course you make however much you need for your get together I'm gonna do it's a tablespoon a little pitch more because why not and then mayonnaise okay that's probably like three tablespoons of mayonnaise and then our chocolate black pepper Fancy no nose mozzarella cheese okay stir this all together and if you like green onions of course you can just chop yours up and put it in this mixture and bake it but since I don't I'm just going to top ours so I can kind of eat around it but bunky can still enjoy it and you want to have your oven preheating to 400 and then you're going to need like a baking dish so I'm going to use my cast iron skillet you use whatever dish you want and if you're not doing a cast iron skillet just make sure that you lightly grease yours before you dump everything in [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so here's the best part we are only going to bake this for 10 minutes until all of that cheese is melted and that corn softens just a little bit then we'll pop it under the broiler for two minutes and this will be ready so in like 15 minutes all together you've got the most incredible corn dip okay so it's been 10 minutes let's check in on this thing see how it's looking oh my gosh so good okay I'm gonna put another Broiler for two minutes okay I don't think y'all are ready for this wow [Music] okay I'm gonna try and taller tube I have a mouthful of this dip I'm trying to get a mouthful of the depth hands down bumping one of my favorite dips of all time tell me you like this dip better than the other cheese dip they're so completely different and the other one was amazing as well but you know how much I love corn yeah and it's like sweet oh my gosh funk you gotta try it sweet and cheesy yes just absolute amazing goodness well thank you for putting a little oh you're supposed to kind of put those in the [Music] they would be real good cooked into it throughout imparting that delicious onion flavor I understand hmm it's crazy it's crazy that's like the trifecta what it's sweet salty and savory yes all of it monkey you don't understand I'm obsessed I cannot stop eating it that is good y'all you have to make this okay trust me you have to make this if you love corn obviously it's got the juice it's got the juice if y'all know you know I do like a sweet pop of corn in there with with the cheese yes and then I think you said there's some sugar in there you can kind of kind of get a little bit of that sweetness too so that's like the curry mayonnaise yes it takes a kale corn popcorn funky it's crazy yeah not good okay I am not staring y'all wrong with this one I know I tell you to try lots of things and I'm telling you everything that I tell you is so good but I am telling y'all this it is like one of my favorites ever I'm not even joking hands down obsessed and it was the most simple thing in the whole wide world to make you have to try it okay listen Okay so our cheese ball has just like a little bit longer but he's not gonna have that as like a little appetizer to our dinner tonight so I will finish sharing that with y'all here in just a little bit you know what I thought about what I thought about putting the rest of that Jalapeno in there you did it would be good and wouldn't it that was a good thought yeah okay it is pumpkin cheese ball time and I am pumped it is the most beautiful day here today the most amazing Breeze it feels like cool and crisp outside so monkey and I are gonna have this out on the back patio maybe a little glass of wine you think sounds lovely okay so come down here you can see my pumpkin set up so nicely I'm so excited to take these

gorgeous funky you're so good this is so cute and of course I have my little pumpkin plate here okay but we're not done like I told y'all we still have the Finishing Touch here so get you a bell pepper it can be any color it doesn't matter because all we need is the green stem I wouldn't go with orange though no or just using the stem or maybe you should go with orange oh you see yeah okay hang on oh I get it now oh you get it yeah okay now cut all this around here all but we're not gonna waste it because you can actually use all of this cut it into strips and use this to dip into your

_zScxem8SNo.json;now I am totally down with having a drink with these guys crispy crunchy and they're so cute my little twist on the prawn cocktail we're gonna do the wonton cups first this couldn't be easier guys so simple it's why I love this as an entertaining dish now get yourself some wonton wrappers and I like to cut these into round circles because if you leave them square the sort of corners kind of stick up and they get all burnt and brown in the oven which I don't like so I'm cutting these just like that now the Asian mum in there is not gonna let anything oh yes sir don't throw these guys away pop them in the freezer next time you're doing a wonton noodle soup just to throw them in with your noodles and they make a nice little addition you really want a neutral tasting oil here I really don't want my Asian style prawn cocktail to have some olive oil kind of flavor so rice bran oil vegetable oil peanut oil any of those things is fine now a couple of tricks here to get the perfect one time cup so what you want on wrap it in create some little folds in the side don't have all the folds bunched up at once now the aim here is to get rid of all the air we don't want any air pockets expanding and ruining our pretty little wonton cups okay so there's only need five minutes in a hot oven until they're nice and crispy now you can't have an ultimate front hotel without the ultimate cocktail sauce and mine obviously has a little bit of an Asian twist which I love but first of all standard we start off with some mayonnaise and some ketchup it's almost a sheer sauce and now here's where we go all rogue and add our Asian ingredient and I'm using a Korean chili paste called gotcha Jeong and I want a fair decent spoonful of that this is like all spicy and silky and Mommy flavored and just add such an awesome kick to your cocktail sauce and then we want some extra tang with some fresh lime juice now I'm gonna get all fancy here and make myself a little piping bag so into a cup that's the easiest way to go about it and then pour all that saucy goodness right in there twist all right time to get the rest of my ingredients ready and I've just got some shredded iceberg lettuce and a little bit of coriander my prawns of course and I'm just gonna grab this avocado it's a little bit of that and I want some pretty fine dices of avocado a little cups are gonna be very small and dainty so whenever cut it'll be the same now just squeeze a little bit of lime juice on that avocado to stop it from browning and add some extra flavor anyway and now these amazing looking prawns now these are quite large so I'm gonna cut them in half lengthways it just all depends on the size of the prawn that you've got so what we want to end up with are just some nice little chunks that will fit inside our little cups [Music] now these have had time to cool down and they're super crispy and uber cute so get those out onto a platter now if you want to make these the day before just store them in an airtight container just at room temperature in your pantry so they stay nice and crispy a little bit of lettuce in the bottom of each cup because of course you want everything fresh and vibrant and lovely for your party guests I would do this assembly stage just before your guests arrive you don't want these sitting around too long because things will get a little bit soggy okay now makeshift piping bag just cut the end of that and I'm gonna little drizzle on my lettuce leaves some chunky pieces of those beautiful prawns you could totally do this with crab as well or some little chunks of lobster if you want to get really fancy and then a little bit more sauce because you can always have more sauce actually when it's all spicy and creamy and delicious like this one okay a little bit of avocado on there I feel like I'm in an episode of tiny kitchen and then a final flourish of some finely chopped coriander now if Cayenne is not your thing don't worry you could use a spring onion or a little bit of mint or just leave the hooks off all together and there you have it guys the ultimate if not the cutest little prawn cocktail you'll see this holiday season don't you [Music];['primeros']
0y5AzkeAb5M.json;well hello there friends fantastic recipe today an old classic a staccato pueblo we're going to make about a filet mignon and i'm going to serve with my foam down potatoes remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned friends we're doing it right now together [Applause] well hello there friends we're going to make a sticker probably today but we're going to make it with a filet mignon a lot of you have asked can i do with the fillet can i do it with this steak can i do with this steak and do with rebar you can do it with the new york sweep you can do it with the film in yourself in fact the first one of the first video i did when i started this channel a year and a half two years ago was a um a stegopro with the new york strip and that was one of my first video i mean we've posted video 10 years ago and i never did anything with it but last year a year and a half ago is when i really really started and we did the stack of huawei it was a great success but um i changed a few things and i want to talk to you about it very simple the first thing i said in one of the video in that video it said don't cook your steak in butter and what i made by that don't use whole butter because whole butter will be on whole butters got milk protein and they burn at 250 degrees so we don't want to use that we want to use clarified butter in the original video i was using olive oil which um i i just didn't want to make the video more complicated than it was i was starting i said you know here i am a french chef i'm going to use clarify butter and nobody's going to know what it is i haven't demonstrated what it was no did i know you guys are in with it let me tell you my audience my subscriber you guys are amazing and uh and it was such a pleasure i did a clarified video video clarify about a video it's right over there for those of you that have not seen it the reason why we use clarified butterflies is because we removed the milk protein and now we have a butter and it's not going to burn until 450 degrees really high smoke point so we're gonna cook the steak in that butter and then we're gonna finish the sauce using whole butter so in this recipe we got two butter clarified butter and whole butter all right friends so i got filet mignon you can say do it with a ribeye do with a pork chop do it with a chicken do it with a duck do whatever they want same principle all right i got cracked black pepper in my hair my friends and then cracked black pepper i'll go in a minute i'll show you how i do it and i i literally crack whole uh black pepper i put them in a bag and i do it so i already sold the steaks because i had time if you don't have time to sold the steaks my friends uh then you do the salt here okay don't worry about it um i put black pepper on both sides and i'm not afraid of burr on the black pepper i hear so many people said oh you're gonna burn i don't know where to get that idea from but you don't burn it i promise you they don't stay here long enough to be honest we're going to make a nice beautiful maya reaction which is the most important thing about this deck is to make a maya reaction create a beautiful crust like i said if you have the time salted at least an hour or two you can do it overnight if you have never seen the steak video how to cook the perfect steak right over there check it out it's a really good video again a very successful video but if you don't have the time put the salt and the pepper now and you'll be perfectly fine we're going to bring this up to really really high temperature at least 365 400 and and you'll see it uh now remember uh uh clarified butter has a very very high smoke point so it's not going to burn and we're not going to see it burning but it's going to uh be the perfect temperature to give us what we call the maya reaction and the maya reaction is carbonization or protein and that's what gives us a beautiful crust and then we're going to use the same pan to make the sauce really simple my friends this is like the easiest thing in the world the only thing you really need is a good beef stock and for those of you that have made a bee stock you know what i'm talking about this is really really beautiful you see look look how beautiful it is it's beautiful and rich it's really important it's like making a soup a sauce your base is going to be a stock if you have a good stock you're going to make a good soup so a good stop or a good stew if you have a crappy stock it's a little more difficult so find a stock you like okay all right friends we're going to go in we're going to put it in and we don't touch it we don't touch it no you hear a lot of people tell you to touch it to do it i don't touch it my friends i don't touch it because i want to create that maya reaction oh i'm clean i thought i was dirty in here but no i'm not now i want to create a maya reaction which is extremely important so i don't touch it and don't worry about it it's not going to burn my friends quite a contrary no matter what anybody tells you it's not going to burn i've been making this recipe for 50 plus years and i promise you i make thousands of them nobody ever said you know we love your steak or whatever but it's a little burn on the outside it's beautiful you'll see you see the menopause you're going to love it all right so the peppercorn you know what i do friends i take the whole peppercorn the whole peppercorn i put them in a baggie like that close it and voila that's how i take migration out my friends you see and voila i got crushed black pepper pretty simple right we're also gonna put some green peppercorn my friends what's the difference you know green peppercorn i said the same thing at the original video what's the difference between green peppercorn and black peppercorn yeah one is green when it's black right uh-huh yeah the black peppercorn my friends the black peppercorn is dried and the green peppercorn is fresh and put into a brine and the brine is just salt water and citric acid which is an actual preservative i got my oven going at 500 degrees when 500 degrees we're going to cook it really good where did you see how beautiful this is we're ready pay attention look at this look at this look at this my friends is that gorgeous or what so now people say why don't you cook it the other side we're going to take it right now we're going to turn it off we're going to pop it in a 500 degree oven don't worry about it 500 degree oven we're going to cook it until it's perfectly cooked i'm going to make a little green beans um actually i'm you know i'm going to wait a little bit to make the green beans because we're going to we're going to have to wait i'll tell you what i'll do friends the maggot sample i'm going to cook this to a perfect 125 130 because i like a medium rare it's up to you how you like it and then we're going to let it rest and while it's resting we're going to make the sauce all right so i'll be back in a couple of minutes and i'll finish the whole thing okay friends few minutes go by don't waste too much time remember friends don't waste too much time my friends look at this it looks beautiful now it all depends how you like to cook okay i'm going to put them on the side let's get get a little caramelization on the side don't forget to get yourself a thermometer my friends get yourself a thermometer some of them are inexpensive and quite amazing this guy right there polder great brand uh this one right here um a thermal pen a little more expensive is it better no it's faster not better so it's up to you my friend don't be afraid to get yourself a thermometer i got some um you know when i have stick of guava friends i gotta have a little green beans i was lucky enough today i went to the stove and i got the uh the green and the yellow bean check this out green and yellow beans check it out really nice i'm gonna eat that up we're gonna warm them up okay all right this guy's good we're gonna take him and we're gonna put him on the side now my friends we're gonna make the sauce now at this point we got a little too much butter here we're gonna take a little bit of it out we're not taking them all out we're not taking the whole thing out just a little bit right there oh oh i got to show you at this point friends we're putting the cognac oh don't forget also my friends when you take a panda out of the oven always leave one of those okay because you know it's hot but if you leave the kitchen for whatever reason

let's put a little stock in here this layer is hot everything i have is hot little stock in here okay we're looking good now we're gonna put some heavy whipping cream heavy whipping cream none of that low fat cream my friends all right and now we're gonna put the green peppercorn on them now let me tell you about the green peppercorn what i do friends if you haven't seen the original video let me put the beans in there friends i'm gonna put it on butter also with the green beans eh we never have too much butter hey you come back over here this is just uh it's it's my thing you know i love to serve uh green beans with a stick of water you can do a spinach you can do broccoli you can do whatever you want my friends now the secret friends is to let this reduce to the right consistency now you got a lot of peppers in there and you have enough now if you want to add a little extra pepper you can certainly take your win peppermill and add a little bit more it's up to you to see how much pepper you like okay i love a lot of pepper so i put a lot of pepper we got a lot of reduced friends until we have the right consistency and then we're going to finish it up with butter and i'm also going to serve it with my potatoes i have my phone down potatoes and those potato my friends are in the oven you see look how beautiful the green beans look like let's put a little black pepper in it because we don't have enough white pepper in this recipe a little salt and the green beans are beautiful now the sauce is reducing and um the filets are resting in fact i'm going to move everything out of here out of the way so then we can do no no i gotta need the butter i'm not moving the bottle out of the way there you go right there we're looking good i can reduce the temperature of this and my phone down potato friends i got them in the oven i got my phone done potatoes look it's reducing my friends let me take all the stuff out of the way so then the camera doesn't have the handle look look at this we're going to finish this up with butter this is the exciting part if a lot of you have watched this video about the original video but a lot of you have not watched it so that's why i did it and then somebody left a comment the other day and says you know what can i do it with filet mignon now why why is filet mignon great a filet mignon is not like a ribeye or a new york strip it doesn't have much fat in it it doesn't have the flavor that we buy would have so with the strong sauce like this oh you're doing amazing okay that's the whole idea this sauce right there it's got all the flavor of course gonna be based on how good your stock is my friend let me take the potatoes out of the oven i got those foam down potatoes the link is uh is over there look at this it's a beautiful little fondant potato folks okay they are stuffed with uh with a brie cheese and a mascarpone cheese and a goat cheese they're amazing i'll tell you those potatoes are going to be amazing so here's what we're going to do okay we're going to take a a plate and we're gonna do it right here friends and it's looking good this is looking good let's now make ourselves a beautiful plate all right those are we gotta finish the sauce now friends now what we're going to do now we're going to finish the sauce we're going to put the butter and remember butter is an emulsion so if you put butter on the sauce you got a little bit of the thyme okay and make sure it doesn't melt so and don't make sure the sauce my friends is not boiling when you do this you don't want the butter to separate remember butter supper is 190 degrees so if you put the butter while it's boiling your butter is not going to thicken your sauce the butter is going to separate you see and this is going to be enough i mean you can put more all right you know you're not gonna hear me complain if you put more butter in there more butter is better more is better yeah about a little more what do you think just a little bit more just a little bit more everybody's saying yes yes yes yes because they're gonna have it over there all right let me put a little salt in our sauce and i think we're good my friends all right so we're gonna do we're gonna take one of the beautiful fillets right there i wish i could have this uh juice right there but you can't have it because it's uh it's i don't want it in the sauce i don't want the the clarified butter to mess up my sauce to mess up my presentation so the sauce is good you see look how beautiful the butter is you see so now we're going to take a couple of green beans and we're going to put them on the plates you know normally i like to put them in the same direction but everybody always said i'm a nut because i wanted the beans in the same direction well i'm still going to do it either at least i'm going to put them straight maybe they won't be the same exact direction because uh and in the beans you know i like to leave the ends i remove the uh the pot then attach it to the we're good right there i say leave it alone right there i'm talking to myself when i said i'm not talking to you guys because you leave it alone you leave it alone if you want to leave it alone look at the beautiful potato my friends one is not going to be enough i think we got to put two because two is going to be what we need you know i you know what we're among friends about three now the moment i've been waiting for and you've been waiting for is jean-pierre to put the sauce on it so here we have it look how beautiful that is now that sauce friends on anything i don't care what you put it on it's gonna be amazing all right so look at this you're going to take the sauce right there my friends and you put it on here and look how beautiful it is it's meant to be on top okay that's a classic dish it's an old-fashioned dish put as much sauce as you want you got to put it on top okay you can put it underneath if you want because it looks maybe more elegant but let me tell you friends this is what a sticker is supposed to look like let's cut into this one guys so we can see it because in the first video i didn't cut into it it was my beginning of youtube boy i heard enough of you guys said hey what are you doing so look we're going to cut right in the middle of it and this my friend is gorgeous if you like a medium rare okay if

1udGcXDiylc.json;- Today, I'm gonna show you how to make the best ever beef tenderloin roast. Beef tenderloin is. perfect for the holidays in taking center stage on. your Christmas dinner table because it's elegant. and so incredibly tender that it almost feels indulgent. It's also a pricey cut of meat, which can make it feel. a little intimidating. But fear not, because I've got an easy, totally foolproof recipe for you today. In fact, if you made my. prime rib recipe last year, you may notice some similarities. with the garlic herb crust. But this beef tenderloin recipe cooks in about half the time. It's also super easy to carve. You just have to slice it up. And it's insanely. delicious when it's served with my homemade horseradish sauce, which I'll also show you how to make. I'm really excited to share. this recipe with you today because it's one of my personal favorites. So, let's dive right in. There are three important pieces of kitchen equipment. you need for this recipe including a 12 inch of oven-safe pan, either stainless steel or. cast iron like this one. Some kitchen twine to. tie up the tenderloin. And this is really important. because the meat comes in somewhat of an oblong shape. And an instant read thermometer to ensure that you cook the meat to. the perfect temperature, which for me is medium rare, but your preference may be different. You could also use a probe. thermometer if you have one, and these are great because. you don't have to open the oven to see what the temperature is. When you go to the butcher, ask for a whole beef tenderloin. That's about four to. four and a half pounds. That's what I'm using today. You could also use two two-pound. center cut tenderloins, which is just the middle portion. with the ends trimmed off. Sometimes, that's available. at your butcher counter, and it's also known as. a chateaubriand cut. Now, because I have a whole. beef tenderloin today, you'll notice one end is thicker and the other end thins out. You'll wanna fold that thinner end over, so that the meat is uniform in thickness. This ensures that the. meat will cook evenly, and we'll tie it up here in a second. But in order to get this big. hunk of meat to fit in a pan, you'll need to slice it in half. So, once the thin end is folded over, find the midway point and slice it. As I mentioned in the intro, beef tenderloin is a pricey cut of meat, and there's a good reason why. It's where filet mignon comes from. Filet mignon is actually. just the middle portion of the tenderloin sliced up. And that my friends is why this recipe is such a coveted main during the holidays. Now, it's really important. that the beef tenderloin is tied up with kitchen twine, which makes it more uniformly. shaped for even cooking. So, don't skip this step. Tie the twine around one. end of the tenderloin, about an inch from the end, and tie it in a knot on top. Sometimes, you have to. shimmy the twine underneath to get it into the right spot. But when you pull it tight, the tenderloin will form. more of a cylindrical shape. Then just twist a portion of. the twine around your hands, and place it over the end, and bring it down to about an. inch below your first knot. Pull that tight and then. keep repeating this process until you've got the beef. tenderloin all tied up. When you're done, just snip. the twine with scissors. (gentle upbeat music) If you find that it's difficult to tie the beef tenderloin this way, you could also cut six to. eight individual pieces of twine about 10 to 12 inches in length. Place them under the beef. tenderloin next to each other, an inch or so apart. And then tie individual knots on top. It's really up to you. But when you're done, you'll have tied up. that tucked end of meat. And as you can see, both pieces are now uniform in thickness. Place the beef tenderloin on a plate and let it come to room temperature, which will take about one to two hours. All right. While you're. waiting on the tenderloin, you can make two things. The herb butter mixture and. the homemade horseradish sauce. To make the herb butter, place six tablespoons of softened butter into a small mixing bowl and mince six garlic cloves on top. Then peel the leaves off of a. few fresh sprigs of rosemary and finely chop it. You'll want about a teaspoon. of finely chopped rosemary. You'll do the same thing with fresh thyme. Just remove the leaves by sliding your fingers down the stem, then finally chop about a teaspoon or so, and add it to the mixing bowl. If your butter is softened. to room temperature, this should be really easy to mix up with either a fork or spoon. And once it's fully combined, just set that to the side. To make the homemade horseradish sauce, add half a cup of sour cream. to a small mixing bowl. And if you wanna make this dairy-free, feel free to swap in your favorite store-bought dairy-free sour cream, or you can use my cashew sour. cream recipe from my website. To that, add two tablespoons. of prepared horseradish. Horseradish has a strong. pungent flavor like wasabi. But when it's mixed with these. other creamy ingredients, it's softened into the. most delicious flavor. Add one tablespoon of mayonnaise, one tablespoon of finely chopped chives for a pop of herby greens, and one teaspoon of Dijon mustard for that perfect punch of spice. Lastly, add a quarter. teaspoon of kosher salt and a sprinkle of freshly. ground black pepper. Give that a stir to mix it all up. And if you'd like, you can transfer it to a serving bowl and top it with a little. bit more fresh chives so that it's ready to be served. when the tenderloin is done. Okay, back to the beef tenderloin. Preheat your oven to. 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 220 degrees Celsius, and then pat the tenderloin. with a few paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Sprinkle it with one. teaspoon of kosher salt, and a good amount of freshly. cracked black pepper. Rub that in with your hands, flip it over, and then repeat this. process on the other side, making sure the seasoning is. fully coated all over the meat. (gentle upbeat music) Add about two tablespoons of avocado oil to a pan on medium high heat. Give it a swirl to coat the bottom. And once the oil is shimmering and hot, add the beef tenderloin. And see that big four pound, well, mine was actually closer to four and a half pounds of hunky meat, fits perfectly into a 12-inch skillet. Sear the meat for a few. minutes on each side until a nice golden brown crust forms, then use tongs to flip. it and sear another side. This should take about. 10 to 12 minutes total. (gentle upbeat music) Once all the sides have a. beautiful golden brown crust, spoon your herb butter mixture on top. It will start to melt. right away but that's fine. The butter will melt down the edges and the garlic and herbs will stay on top. If you're using a probe thermometer, you can insert it now and then transfer the. whole pan to the oven. In about 15 to 20 minutes, you'll have perfect medium rare meat when the temperature reaches 120 degrees. But if you'd like it cooked to a more medium level of doneness, I've got a temperature chart on the full blog post on my website. The meat is going to smell. amazing when it's done and I know you're gonna. want a slice right into it. But it's really important that you let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes, so that the juices can. redistribute in the meat. That's how you get the most succulent and tender slices of beef tenderloin. But while you're waiting, you can snip the twine and. remove it from around the meat. (gentle upbeat music) After it's rested, use a sharp knife to. slice the beef tenderloin into one-inch thick pieces. Now, I know this doesn't. look medium rare on video, but you'll have to trust me that it is. It's just the studio lights from filming are shining right on it. But you'll see how perfectly pink it is when I change camera angles, like in these shots. It's such a beauty sliced. onto a serving platter with a few extra sprigs of rosemary. It will definitely be the shining star of your holiday party or Christmas dinner. Beef tenderloin is delicious served up with honey glazed carrots, green beans, garlic herb roasted potatoes, and roasted broccoli, or roasted brussel sprouts. And I have recipes for all. of those on my website. But today, I'm just going. to plate a few pieces and top it with the horseradish sauce. It's simple, classic, and literally just melts in your mouth. If you enjoyed today's video, make sure to give it a thumbs up, share it with your family and friends, and I will see you again. next year in the next video. I wish you guys all the. best during the holidays. And I can't wait to see your photos of how this recipe turns out. (gentle upbeat music);['segundos']

gonna i'm do it very slowly yeah it's so slowly it's not even moving uh and it's just i do it when i saute the bacon like this friend i do it very slowly because i wanna i want the fat i wanna use the bacon fat so we're going to saute the salsa berry steak uh in in the bacon fat and then we're going to use the bacon to make the sauce we're going to make a nice sauce mushroom sauce with it all right so friends i got the the meat right there we're going to put an egg then we're going to put a little bit of garlic i'm going to save some for the sauce the ground garlic chopped garlic freshly chopped garlic we're going to put a little bit of a mixture i have mixture of thyme and rosemary and then i'm also going to put some chopped parsley and then i'm going to put some finely chopped parsley you can just do one it'll be perfectly fine then we're going to put a little bit of worcestershire sauce that's going to give us quite a bit of salt we're going to put a little bit of um hot sauce don't want to use hot sauce don't worry about them and i like to use a little bit of buttermilk this can you know it's very similar to the recipe i make friends for my meatloaf if you've never had my meatloaf oh you're gonna try it out right over there jack's gonna put a link in there for you meatloaf is amazing it really is then we're going to use some fresh breadcrumb you can use dry breadcrumb but i don't like it you know so i use freshwater how do you make fresh breadcrumb right over there there's a link i use it for the tomato pie i use it for the meatloaf i use it for so many the recipe for i put on top of fish i put this boycott on top of fish you can eat this by itself it's so it's so good you're going to put things in there it's got to be good don't forget anything it's possible you can also put your cayenne pepper you can also put a little bit of dry mixture of the provence if you haven't if you don't have it all about a dry mixer but probably have some oregano thyme rosemary in there basil mix all this up friends you see mix all it up you don't want to mix it up more than you have to but why would you want to do that anyway you know you hear people oh don't mix it up too much you're going to make it tough oh we're not going to mix it anymore than we have to it's kind of fun actually i forgot to put salt in there i know i gotta put it uh uh uh worcestershire sauce but that's not gonna be enough so here we go i can't go in there in the salt right now so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take the gloves out oh boy takes the gloves out i take the gloves out i'm gonna put the salt and then i'm also going to put some pepper and i'm going to use my coarse pepper because i like it that way and now i'll tell you what real quick i put another glove on it'll be quicker to put the glove on than to try to do it with the uh with the spatula you see and then we're gonna make the steak all right and i got a easy method to make him i'm to show you i feel like i'm making making dough i need another glove hold on hold on yeah it takes two seconds you watch not exactly that'll teach me to forget something i'm always forgetting something you notice that i always forget something all right we're going to make them now all right so now i got a mess over here that's okay i'm still going to clean my hands so look thanks what i do is i take a cookie mold cookie cutter cookie cutter mold right and i put it in there this i i already know because i've been using it so you have to calculate it this is gonna give me a um a six ounce steak six ounce by the way i didn't tell you that but i got two 24 ounces one and a half pound of of ground chuck okay so i can make six four six ounces that's exactly what i'm doing so you see what i like to do i like to just bang it make sure it's nice and tight okay make sure it's nice and tight that's very important right and then we remove it right and then it's not a hamburger right it's a steak so when we take it we make it look like a steak so you push it but you see it's nicely together okay all right my friends so i'm gonna do this three more times right there maybe a little bigger yeah three more time uh and then i'm gonna put them in a cooler i'm gonna let them chill a little bit because they it's easier to handle them if we let them chill a little bit and then when we come back i'm going to remove the bacon and we're going to saute them and then we're going to put them on a cookie sheet we're going to tell them cool a little bit it's easier you could do it right away but trust me it's easier if you just take your time you chill them and uh and then we're gonna continue we do the whole thing so we'll be back in a couple of minutes i'm gonna continue making them okay friends so the the uh the fat bacon fat you see that we're gonna saute the steak in there it's hot i wonder about um i'm looking at at least three hundred three and a quarter see the sticks are holding together i call them steaks it's really a hamburger hamburger stick yeah and uh and we're gonna sear them get a beautiful color that's all we need to do and then friends we're gonna transfer them we're gonna still use the same band we're going to transfer them let me clean my hands we're going to transfer them in the oven for a few minutes so you got to make sure you got your oven on it so i got my oven on at 400 and a quarter so i like it to go really quick and um as soon as they golden brown we're going to flip them and i'm going to put them in a cookie sheet i like to cook them on this silicone mats you know the silicone mat i love those i've been using them for years years like ever since they came out 30 years ago i don't know when and they're great because nothing sticks to it silicone you wash it good the secret though with those friends if you got one of those you gotta put down soap dong dong dong dong whatever you call it uh palm olive not substitute not so good i like dom butter don't soak and uh and and you you wash it you let them hair dry let's see what do we got here i want a beautiful color let me see what i got it's starting it's not exactly what i want so but this is uh let's see yeah yeah it's starting to look good you see they're starting to look good friends so what we're going to do we could certainly um smells good we could certainly uh put them in the fry pan like that in the oven but i want to use the fry pan and all that goodies all that bacon powder and everything i want to use that i may have a little too much fat actually i'm going to remove some of it making beautiful golden brown and then we're going to put them on on the cookie sheets and then we're going to come back and make the sauce okay so voila voila and they're not going to be in there very long but you could certainly cook them in the sauce but you know i made them pretty thick i think they're more they get a better result if you uh cook them so i'm gonna pop them in the oven i got the oven going and then you see who it's hot in there and then i'm gonna get rid of some of that fat i got a little ball in here i just got a little too much i don't need all that i mean you know what i'm not gonna throw it away i'm not gonna throw that fat away because that fat is gonna be delicious for anything making omelettes saute anything right i mean anything friends now we're going to start testimonial remember the onion is always number first number one all right always always always always saute the onion make it look beautiful golden brown and then what else are we going to put in here what what else that we're going to put in here let me take this out of there let me get myself a uh a plate so i can put my thing i got we're going to make a sauce now you know remember friends i know a lot of you make you you make your your steak the way you want i i do the same i make it the way i want and it might not be what you think it should be but that's cool make it the way you want it you know i'm sharing my recipe with you you know i find it interesting when people are watching the channel they go well that's not the way i do it's like when i did the uh the shepherd spa mamma mia how many people oh that's not a shepherd spice my space my shepherd spy you're watching my channel i make it the way i like it you don't like the way i like it make your own channel yeah having a channel some people have great ideas start your own channel look youtube is a great place to share your idea for instance your idea all right look the ono is starting good we're going to give him another minute or so what else am i going to put in there i got the bacon i'm going to put in i'm going to put some more garlic i'm going to put some more fresh herbs you know what i'm going to put also it's a worcestershire sauce i got it right there i put it away earlier but i'm going to put some of that worcestershire sauce and i'm going to put some wine you don't have to if you don't like the wine a lot of people don't drink wine so uh if they don't drink wine there's nothing wrong with that just start a little more beef stock that's all you don't need to replace wine you don't drink it just put stock i mean you gotta replace it with the liquid but you don't need to you know this is how you replace it you just don't put it in and you put extra stock okay the onions are good now we're gonna put the mushroom and what do we do with the mushroom we gotta get rid of the water and what's gonna help us get rid of the water salt and i was thinking this recipe will be happy with the mushroom salt or the roasted garlic salt or the mushroom sauce roasted garlic sauce i think it'll be perfect in here you see a bit of salt in there and we're going to cook we're going to wait a minute so we're going to take a little break folks we're going to come back this is gonna take about four or five minutes so i'm gonna take a quick little break we'll come back when the mushrooms have lost all of their water okay friends look at the mushrooms they lost all of their water you see they lost all of their water so now we're going to finish the other ingredient we're going to put the bacon we're going to put a fresh thyme and then we're going to put our garlic you see put the garlic in there and a minute the second not the minute you see here ain't gonna be no minute the second we smell the garlic that means it's releasing its fragrance we're gonna put the wine another reason why friends i like to use a madeira or a masala or a pork is because they fortified wine and they don't need to be reduced some people say well why don't you reduce it so i answered the question a couple of times and i'm going to continue a little bit until the questions stop coming but think about something when you're cooking why are you reducing wine what are you reducing you're reducing it to make it softer to make it sweeter to make it not as bite because when you bring a regular wine like a chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon to boil you test it it's terrible you want to get rid of the alcohol this guy right there is already sweet you don't need to reduce it to make it nice and slow and soft and and smooth it's a fortified one so here we go so that's why i like to do you don't want to put that wine don't worry about it just put the put a red wine and just let it reduce that's all right we're going to put a little bit of um worcestershire sauce in the sauce and then we're going to put i'm going to take the steaks out friends i'll take them out let them rest a little bit i call it a steak right and then we're gonna put a little bit of beef beef broth i have my brief broth right there friends and of course at that point you make as much or as little sauce as you wish it's really up to you at this point friends so now you see the sauce is a little thick a little thin so we want to thicken it so for those of you that have followed my video on how to thicken anything where we make that roux you'll be happy to see that i'm reusing it because i really want you guys to start doing this this is really a cool trick remember we did this on a video how to thicken everything video right there if you haven't seen it this is a great way to do it this is a cooked roux if i were to use a regular roux i would have to put it at the beginning so it cooks the flour on well this has cooked already it was in the oven all night so this is a cook roux and this is a brown roux so i'm going to put very little of it just to thicken so it's to the right consistency and you see the fact that it's already cooked it doesn't it doesn't need to uh uh to wait for it to thicken your watch it's gonna stick in right away so if you don't have any cook root and most people don't have it you follow the video and you try to do it because you can keep at a room temperature right here on your counter it'll last a few months from there don't worry about it it's full it's clarify butter so that's why you scrape fry butter so it doesn't go bad and you can leave it in your counter without having to worry about it so maybe just a little bit more what do you think friends what do you think just a little bit more and what that does that adds a little bit of butter also and then i'm gonna add more you see so right there friends you have yourself an amazing sauce then we're going to test make sure it's good because uh what how can it be good i didn't put any butter yet so i am going to uh to test it it's gonna be hot need salt more salt yeah and more butter turn the heat off and more butter oh yeah yeah don't be afraid okay now you don't have to put the butter but i do now remember when you put the batter friends you turn the heat off and you want to mix it right away and look how beautiful that is so i love freshly freshly chopped parsley at the last minutes because i love the fresh fragrance of freshly topped chopped parsley and uh and right there my friends you have yourself a beautiful mushroom sauce that you can make with a steak you can you don't have to make it with a salisbury steak you can make with any steak you want and look how beautiful that is my friend now i'm going to test it again to make sure it's good and make sure it's good look at this you see look at this one well i can't take it so big of a spoon because it's delicious i just got a nice piece of bacon in there okay i'm gonna make a platter now this i like to serve family style not make a friend fancy you can serve with mashed potatoes you can certainly do some spinach you can do some green beans you can do a bunch of stuff with it then put the sauce on top you can put the sauce on the side and uh you know i don't have a clean plate can i get a clean

3cBsowVc5bA.json;hey guys welcome back to Parrish if you didn't think you'd ever be able to get a whole roasted chicken on your dinner table on a weeknight I'm here to show you the light the crispy skin juicy bird with an intensely flavored white wine based garlic and herb butter sauce oh my god sign yourselves up and let's get started okay so the first thing we're gonna do is Pat the skin dry that's paramount if you want a crispy skin bird you could also leave it in your fridge overnight and just leave it uncovered and the skin will dry out that way but most people don't have time for that or the room and their refrigerators do it so this is another way take your paper towels and Pat it dries as dry as you can we're gonna remove the backbone with some really sharp kitchen shears if you have like a really sharp knife you can do it that way too but just try to stay as close to the backbone as you possibly can and we're gonna go along both sides of that tail our backbone and it's basically called spatchcocking which sounds like a dirty word but it's not so we're gonna spatchcock this chicken and that's gonna allow us to cook it much faster okay so if you want to save the backbone you can for stock it's perfect for that but I'm just gonna toss it we're gonna clean out the inside of the bird with any unnecessary guts that may be flying around and we're gonna take a really sharp knife and go right down the center of the breastbone that allows the chicken to lay flatter a flatter bird is gonna cook a lot more in the oven because as you know breast meat and the dark meat cook at different temperatures so we want to make sure it's all even and I'm creating very gentle pockets under the skin because I'm gonna season I'm gonna carry the seasonings that I add later you know up under the breast meat and the thigh and just let make sure all of it is seasoned very well I'm starting off with some very flaky kosher salt it's my favorite and some super Monts which just gives it a really good classic flavor of roast chicken and a little bit of garlic powder as well as some onion powder and you want to make sure that you only add these additional seasonings to the flesh side of the chicken and up under the meat side because basically anything that's on the skin other than salt will burn in the oven and we're high roasting this chicken at 425 degrees so we don't want those seasonings to burn add a little bit of olive oil and just massage all of that yummy flavor up in the meat okay just get it up in there try to avoid getting too much of it on the skin because as I said it will burn and we don't want that flip it over and continue to massage make sure it's nice and seasoned so now I'm going to drizzle a little all over the surface of the bird a very thin layer just massage it all over the chicken okay so that it's not a she it's got a nice it's glistening you want her to glisten now don't be shy with the coaster salt here I know it looks like a lot but that's because kosher salt has a very large flake and if there it but it has a very gentle saltiness so just get all the crevices and I'm gonna add a little bit of freshly ground black pepper which you know can end up burning in the oven but I really don't care I just like the way that it looks so I'm adding it we're gonna put that on top of a foil lined baking sheet that also has a rack if you don't have the rack don't worry about it it'll still cook fine but just arrange that so that it's nice and flat you're gonna put that in the center of your 425 degree oven until it's done so now we're gonna work on the sauce and this comes together very quickly so melt some butter and a skillet you're gonna add the shallots and cook those for about maybe 2 to 3 minutes just until they're softened then you're gonna add your Provence and crushed red pepper flakes infuse that good fat some crushed black pepper the garlic saute that for about a minute or two I'm adding a little bit more olive oil here and we're just gonna add some white wine if you want to use chicken stock you can do that but I like the flavor of one so why not we want the wine to reduce and it's gonna do that very quickly I've got this over about medium-high heat and I just want to reduce it until it starts to like move like a sauce you know like I'm gonna swish it around you can see that there's some thickness and body to it I'm adding just a little bit of heavy cream to give it just a little bit more richness totally optional but I like it so I'm adding that and now we're gonna lower the heat and add the fresh lemon juice all of our herbs the lemon zest oh my gosh so good you guys just whisk that together so that the herbs can infuse and we added some cold butter to emulsify the sauce and make it a little more richer and thicker and I'm gonna add just a little bit more heavy cream again personal preference it tastes bombs so I'm just gonna take that off the heat this sauce came together in about five minutes so it's very quick [Music] you guys look at this chicken okay she's gorgeous golden-brown delicious crispy perfect I cannot wait for you to try this recipe it's super fast super quick just simple flavors that delicious flavors and you like it you can do this on a weeknight okay there's no excuse not to have those chicken in a weeknight slather her up with sauce don't be

48w9kcBfrVA.json;well hello there friends beef wellington you've been asking me here it is stay tuned i'm gonna show you exactly how to make it friends you can do this one remember thumbs up if you liked the video don't forget to subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it together beef wellington friends all right friends well let me show you how to make this willington first thing we gotta get the beef all right i got a whole tenderloin here it's about a four four and a half pound tenderloin that's enough for what i'm gonna do and what we're gonna use here we're gonna do we're gonna use the chateaubriand now you can certainly buy just this but then i guarantee you're gonna pay the same price for this then you're gonna pay for the whole thing get the whole thing okay so uh there is a video on how to clean it already i already made that video so you'll see it all we want to do if we get the chateaubriand we want to get this part right there friends the head and the tail we can use for something else and if you watch that video on how to cut it you can do it okay so we're gonna use the chateaubriand and that comes from this and this all right this and this we will use for something else now what do we do with this this is the the prime piece of the tenderloin beef so we're gonna salt it and pepper we are going to uh brushes with dijon mustard and we're gonna let it rest in the fridge for at least a couple of hours and then we'll do the rest all right so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to put some pepper and salt and let that salt penetrate for at least 45 minutes to an hour so at least you gotta you gotta have at least an ah an hour my friends to do this okay you gotta do it and all we're gonna do is we're gonna get some nice crust mala reaction we're gonna get some beautiful crust in there okay very simple so far this is um like i say this is not a meal folks the kids are hungry let's make them a willing dog okay this is something you're doing for a special occasion and um now let's make sure the heat is super super hot i don't want to be in there longer than i have to we're not doing a reverse seal when you have such a small piece reverse seal is full you have a bigger piece of meat there's no you can do it if you like to but not in a willington we're going to cook it in the dough all right there's no remember whenever i can fillet willington the dough is the style of the show the beef of course it is but what's most important is to make sure beautiful golden brown the heat i'm looking for here is 375 degrees and well if i turn it on high it'll work better i'm using clarified butter not regular butter if i use regular butter my milk protein are gonna burn it's not gonna work if you don't have clarified butter use a avocado oil use a safflower oil use whatever cooking oil you wanna use but make sure it's super super hot we wanna go in and out of the pan as fast as we can all we wanna do is create some beautiful mala reaction all right now we got the right temperature we're going to put it in here and don't touch it just let it do its thing it's very important we want to get that beautiful caramelization and the maya reaction okay it's really important that's part of the flavor friends all right now we're gonna get both ends really quick really quick we're ready to cook them very much they're going to cook all right so this process friends has to be super fast at a very high heat okay so now while it's still hot let's turn this off get this out of the way while it's still hot let me get a paper towel okay and now we're going to brush it with dijon mustard it has to be dijon mustard friends and we're going to let that mustard flavor and that salt and pepper penetrate really important be generous and i don't take the mustard out of the um out of the jar otherwise you'll contaminate your whole jar of dijon mustard you see so i use a silicone brush those are really cool and they you can wash them really really nice i see people painting with a brush they got a home depot those are great for painting okay that's all they're good for friends be generous more generous than you would be it's really important we're going to take a plastic wrap i'm going to go there let me wash my hand real quick we're going to pull the plastic wrap out and i got this really really cool wrap dispenser i got that online i think i got it like a web restaurant or something all right now we're going to take this we're going to wrap this this way wrap it wrapper wrapper wrap it wrap it put it out of here and all i do at this point friends i'll go like this and look i grab both hands and i just i just do this keep it nice and tight you see just like this now i got a beautiful sausage i'm going to take this and i'm going to put it in the fridge for a good two three hours all right and then we're going to make the dixella and then we're going to make the crepes and then we're going to put it all together all right so we'll be back to make the mushroom decel okay friends now we're going to make the mushroom dixel this here i'm going to tell you a quick story that better be quick this is probably one of the first thing i learned to make in a commercial kitchen i was in a three-star missionary guy restaurant called lustar bomanier in the border provence where i was doing my apprenticeship when i was 14. and and and excel was one of the first thing i learned how to make so um it's butter it's uh uh shallots then we're gonna cook and we're gonna cook for a little minute and we're gonna get them golden brown lightly lightly golden brown and then uh we're gonna put some mushrooms in here friends this is a portobello mushroom you can use a regular mushroom you can use whatever mushroom you can find whatever makes you happy but they have to be cut very very very very small look at this look at this this is like super super small friends and and you'll see why in a minute it's more like um i wouldn't call it the moose but it's more of a i don't know how you call it it's a more like a paste you put around the beef the beef you'll see in a minute but the these guys it looks like a lot of mushroom what that was just that was probably uh 10 ounces of mushroom so it looks like a lot but it's really not a lot and they're going to reduce down to nothing by the time i get rid of the water mushrooms are 80 water so by the time i get rid of the water it's not going to be very much left okay so first thing we're going to do is um we are going to let this these shallots turn translucent so they release some of the acidity and they become nice and buttery i love the smell of shallots that are cooked in butter what else are we putting in here very simple we got mushrooms already we talked about that um i got ham in there for those of you then then don't cook with ham don't worry just don't put it in you know you don't have to ever replace it you know with ham product unless it's a structural ingredient uh you don't have to replace it just don't put it in there you don't need to replace it with anything else it's not necessary so if you don't eat it you don't eat it right because in this recipe i'm going to be putting prosciutto so i can certainly put the ham in there and this is what i call a black forest ham i get it at the grocery store i get a thick slices and i cut it in a very small die again everything's small and i got fresh targon tarragon we're going to put it in if you don't have targon you can use thyme you can use rosemary you can use whatever makes you happy one or two herbs that's it okay and see see right there look they're golden brown that's all i wanted right and now we're gonna put our mushroom in there and uh and you're gonna be amazed how long it's gonna take my friends so when we are going to do it and look look how much it is i barely barely barely can put it all in the fry pan they're not amazing well you're going to be amazed what happened to those mushrooms when it's done so again that is part of the deal in the recipe where you can make all this in advance my fact i highly recommend you make all this in advancements you don't want to do this at the last minute okay and we're gonna put salt and pepper and the salt is gonna help us again getting rid of uh the the water in there and we're gonna let this cook and this is gonna take um i would say a good seven to ten minutes if not more so we're gonna let it cook for a while when the water has mostly disappeared we'll come back we'll put the ham and we'll put the tarragon we'll adjust seasoning and that's all we're going to do we're going to do that we're going to wait and um and and let all the water out okay you'll see it looks like no water is going to come out where did you see i'm we're going to stop it for a second and then we'll come back to you when you see how much water is in the pan okay okay friends i just wanted to show you look at this we lost about half of the volume but it's been a good 10 12 minutes it takes a long time to do these friends so be with it don't just put it on and go do something because you're going to burn the bottom and look at this earlier we could hardly put anything else in the frypan and look at now we're going to continue cooking it for a little bit longer okay i want no more see all that it's all water right there all that water is coming off you put your hand right there you get wet you see it's all water right there we're going to let it out all right we're going to continue doing this for another few minutes all right friends well look at this we got very little left because you you got to mix the first otherwise you'll burn them we don't want to burn them we just want to get rid of the water all right so now i'm putting my ham in there and now you just want to make sure you don't add a in a ham that has water added to it you know you've got a good ham a little bit of tago fresh taco and you know what i forgot but i have this beautiful um uh porcini salt that's amazing salt friends so i'm going to use a little bit of my porcini so it's really really delicious okay all right we're gonna mix all this up i got one more trick oh it smells amazing friends the targons just finally came through it's really really really something um i got one more thing i want to do friends let me get a bowl i want to add a this is a this is a trick you learn when you make a mousse it's to add an egg white and the egg white is going to hit it's going to help binding the whole thing friends we're going to put this in here put it all in there so i can add my egg white you see we're gonna put it all in there and the egg white is gonna act as a binding agent one and make too much of a mess not too bad all right so we got the salt we got the pepper and then one more trick there's always a bunch of tricks all right so we're going to bind this together the egg white is transparent you'll never know it's in there it just helps binding the mousse the the cell a little bit right smells amazing really like wow i love the smell some people add garlic to it you can certainly add garlic but now i don't want to leave it in a bowl because you see all that steam right there that's water so we're going to take it in a cookie sheet and we're going to let it rest until it's cold see and this is it my friend you can use this to uh duck said to stop a pork tenderloin a chicken breast i mean you can use this for so many things this is a classical okay and we're gonna leave it like that and the reason why i put it in a um a cookie sheet versus putting it in a bowl if i put in a bowl the moisture is not going to escape as easily as it is doing it right now in a cookie sheet that said my friend this is a very very beautiful testy uh dexel we're gonna refrigerate it uh not quite yet i'm gonna leave it at room temperature for a little bit so most of that steam comes out and then i put it in the fridge and then we're gonna put we're gonna we're gonna go to step three or step two or three whatever it is all right so we'll be back okay friends we're not gonna make the crepe again that's something you can make in advance a day or two in advance put it in the fridge wrap them with the plastic and don't worry about a thing all right great battery very simple to make um it's uh uh i'll give you the recipe in the video but it's a cup of flour two eggs a cup of milk salt and pepper and you got to create the perfect crepe to make a a the perfect frying pan to use to make a crepe is a crepe that has this kind of edges whatever you want to call that rounded edges so not square if you don't have one of those you probably have one of those and to make a crepe like that i want you to pick up the biggest frypan you got cause bigger the crepe easier it is going to be why are we using a clay you'll see let's see we want to get a regular battery we want to use regular butter we don't want to use clarified butter because we like the milk protein it's going to give your crepe a nice color nothing you're going to see very much in the willington but and in a rule of thumb to make a crepe you've got to have a pretty crepe very pretty and that's going to make it pretty all right so i use a silicone brush i brush it in and i want about 300 degrees roughly so the butter is not going to burn completely but i have hot enough of a of a frypan to make a crate this is about a four ounce little because it's a very big frypan normally three ounce little is enough for eight to ten inch fry pan okay this is a 12 inch fry pan so this is going to be a very big crepe we put it in the middle and we go all the way around it and we keep turning we keep turning we keep turning until the whole frypan is covered keep turning keep turning around keep turning around you see you want to keep turning around because and if you miss a couple of pieces then you want to do this put a couple of bandage in there just in case you wanted to keep it thin though it's not a pancake we're making it's a crepe how long do you cook it yeah just for a minute or two i'm telling you you can make those in advance my friends at least two days in advance when you make them you put them on top of each other don't put a paper in between a parchment paper or anything just put them on top of each other on top and top and top and then when they're still warm don't worry about that if you're going to make them in advance put a um it turned the heat make sure it's not too hot uh put a plastic wrap on it even when they when they're still hot it's gonna keep them nice and moist all right so if you have a regular fry pan you can just flip them you're not gonna be able to flip those because of the edge right there so what you're going to do you're going to see in a minute we're going to wait we're going to wait until let's start it's solid see look you want to you want to feel that quaint you want to feel it moving you see look get with it you're going to be you're going to fit especially if you're doing a a great bed it'll be really easy to flip this guy is not going to be easy to flip so we're not going to flip it we just don't want any crack in it because we're going to need it we're going to need a nice grape okay so let's see what we have so we do it like this and then boom okay really simple you put it in the middle and you flip it you can do this i promise you okay so we're going to cook them we're going to put them on top of each other and then we're gonna put them on a plate we're gonna need just a big plate and can i have a big plate i forgot to grab a big plate and all you do friends you take it right there and you put it on your plate obviously you gotta grab a plate big enough and that's it when you keep making them and put them on top of each other not difficult all right my friends so that's it okay now friends we have almost the last stage that's going to be just before the puff pastry we have a dexel that is now cold and uh and we have a little bit additional mustard we have a crepe and we have a fillet right here i want you to see something now my crepes are very big because i had a 12 inch pens you're probably going to have a smaller crepe unless you got a big pen like mine right so when you look here if i put the crepe around i'm a little short so i'm going to put it all bandage and i'll show you how to do that pretty simple right so what we're going to do first we're going to take the fillet out of the plastic and we're going to put it directly on the crepe okay so come over there and we're going to put it directly on the crepe with the dijon mustard and all right so now oh let me put this away wipe my hand so now i know i need to add another crepe but they're not going to stick together unless i put a little dijon mustard so i take a little bit of dijon mustard and i put it right here and the grape is gonna stand i have so many fillet but just to make sure i have enough we're gonna put a little bit in here okay and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take a second crepe and i'm going to cut it straight cut it straight i can leave that right here and then i put it right here now as you can see i got a bigger surface and what we're going to do now we're going to cut it right here we don't need that that extra space so we take we don't need that so now we have a custom made scrape probably a little too long we don't need that much you see now we just need to cover but remember now we're going to put the excel and the procedure so is going to be thicker so we don't need that much of a crepe we're probably just going to take this out all right so now it's important to measure because now you have to remove this it right there and you have to put your prosciutto and a prosciutto ham you can just buy it like that this is the prosciutto de palma and it comes in like this you just gotta be careful friends can't be too cold when you take it out of the package because you're going to have a very difficult time taking it out if it's too cold it's going to stick to the paper if it's too warm so you're going to have to play with it but you get them like this from your uh deli or wherever you buy your uh your prosciutto you can use a prosciutto the palm is really what you should use if you're not using uh a pork product friends don't worry oh see this one falls apart that's okay as long as we have a good end right because it happened to you whatever happens to me is gonna happen to you my friends i promise you so now you see now we're going to go in there already something you see it's sticking to my paper so hold a second here come to papa yo will you please behave we have a guest would you behave here we go not so pretty but we have no choice we got to keep going this is life recording this is not pretend here friends we're not doing things and uh patching them uh hey you go come on come on come on come on here we go this one's giving me trouble also now we're gonna take one more piece out of this one and i think we'll be just fine if i can get it out of here okay sometimes they come out really easy and sometimes they don't today it's giving me a little issue no problem i can handle it all right so far so good we're going to take this out of the way now we're going to take a duke cell now normally i would eat this but then i can't talk with my mouth full now we're going to take it excel friends and we're going to put it here you don't want to put too much but uh if you have x y these decided you're probably going to end up having a little extra don't worry friends if you have extra you can put it in chicken you can put it in pork you can put it in a bunch of stuff okay and what we're gonna do now we're gonna pat it really nice and down so it's uh you see it's all together here we gotta do take our time here we're looking good let me just clean my hand and i am gonna grab a uh a bigger spatula all right now we're gonna take our fillet right here and we're going to roll friends and we're going to roll and we're going to roll and we're going to roll and we're going to roll and we just made it perfect you see we're all covered all right so now we're going to take this beautiful roll then we have and now we're going to put it in uh we're going to give it a rest oh this is a time consuming thing frank this is not like i said we're gonna make it nice and tight make sure this is nice and tight and now we're gonna give it a little rest so it's all together holds nice together you see look we go back we got a nice beautiful roll and uh let me cut this i'm gonna do the same thing i did earlier where i take both of my ends and i roll them you see then i got myself a perfect perfect roll friends you see look pretty simple formula right all we're going to do now we're going to take this and we're going to refrigerate it so it's solidified and the next step is a fill of pastry all right so far so good right here we go all right friends i'm going to clean up get the puff pastry out and that'll be our last step and then we'll pop it in the oven and uh we got puff pastry though here takes a little bit of measurement here we got to figure out exactly how we're going to do this and uh see this thing is about um six six and a half inches my dough is about ten inches and uh and when we roll it it's gonna be enough to cover the whole thing okay so you're going to have to do a little measurement but usually that's a typical size sheets of pages we do and so now see it's all rolled up nice and neat nice and tight we're going to take it and we're going to take the cut side down see the crepes are holding together perfectly well because they glued together right and then we're just going to do like this see very simple and so far so good right so now what we're going to do when we roll this it's got to stick together so what we're going to do i'll tell you what let me just make sure you understand the concept and then i the idea is to try to explain everything my friends so then you guys know how to do it this is complicated enough of a dish to make and we want to make sure you succeed so we just got to do a few things then you'll understand how it goes okay and there's a sheet of paper underneath and we left it in there this is an egg wash well i i only use the yolk some people use the whole egg and i put a little bit of milk and some people use water so it's really up to you what you want to use okay but this is just egg yolks and a little bit of milk okay so let me just get a rag this one right here because i like to work clean it makes it easier to work in a clean area you come up with a better result all right so now look we're gonna go right there like this and we're gonna roll this dude right there you see so far so good right and then what we're gonna see we're gonna go like this and we're going to take this out take it out slowly we don't want to bruise that dough that though is fragile enough as it is so we take it out of there we want it to be tight so let's make sure the fillet is tight right tight tight and then as it gets ready to be touched right there friends as it gets ready to be touched we want to glue it again okay all right we're going to glue it again and we're going to keep that part right there underneath i'm not sure i'm going to use the whole thing but i don't mind having a little extra dough in the bottom all right tight tight tight make sure it's tight or nice and tight my dough is sticking to my paper and that's not good that's not good so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna get oh i need a little flour please a little flour if you guys give me the flour that'd be great i need a little flour because this dough is sticking to the paper i don't want it to be uh too much flour very very little i'm just gonna put i'm gonna put a little bit right here so my hands are there you go because this thing is sticking and i don't like that that's not good we don't want the paper to stick why is it sticking i don't know but it's sticking all right i'm going to continue rolling it and okay we're good the worst is over now we're gonna do we're gonna fold it i'm gonna fold it like this fold it all in like this okay this is good all right we're good so far so good right all right so now what we're going to do friends we're going to take it we're going to put it right here let me clean up my area we're going to put it right here make sure it's nice and closed and now we're going to do a few decorations no nothing fancy we're not going to do anything fancy we're just going to make it look pretty okay because it doesn't look pretty right now first thing we're gonna do friends we're gonna brush the whole surface with the uh with the egg wash first thing we're gonna do we're gonna wash the whole thing with the egg wash okay you see nothing complicated no the eggs are so yellow somebody was asking me the other day in the comment that says how do you guess it's a yellow thing eggs those are free range egg i'm going to show you the cotton real quick they are amazing we get them at the grocery store get them at publix our grocery store local they've got some really nice things and those eggs are delicious friends no gmo just free range beautiful eggs i'm telling you so here we go so far so good right so then let's make it look pretty friends all right nothing fancy you watch i'm not going to do anything fancy at all which means you can all do it that's the whole idea is not having something so fancy then you can't do it at home all right we want to make sure you guys can do it at home let me show you the egg real quick before i forget friends it's right there this is the egg that we get you see free range no gmo they're wonderful and they're so yellow and they make amazing eggs omelettes everything amazing all right so what are we doing now folks i take a regular uh cookie cutter i mean yeah yeah yeah no not cookie cutter what do you call those things uh whatever and then um let me see that dough looks like it's a little bruise over here you see so i'm not going to use that in fact i'm not going to use this at all i'm just going to get rid of that part right there we don't need that sticking again that's not good okay so we're gonna create just a the simplest decoration friends a child could do this take it right there let's hope it doesn't stick so i don't have to pull on it i don't like to pull on that though okay so far so good we're just gonna go right there friends and put it right on there just like this we're gonna take a um scissors it's easier instead of putting on it you want to cut it see just like this right and then we're going to put another one across so we want to make sure it sticks same where's my cutter oh here it is i know nobody was going to touch i'm by myself right here so cut the same thickness same thickness friends very simple oh sticking again all right here we go right there right there so make it look like a present eh there you go right there friends so far so good right i like it so far and we're gonna make it like i said very simple i'll tell you what we're gonna do we're gonna put a um a little cookie cutter thing on top of it right on top just like this let's take a what size do you think how about how about that size hey that size good so we go right there all right just like this ah it's sticking oh boy i'll tell you there we go just like that you see very simple right and a very very simple thing we could do we could put another one on each side what do you think and then we're going to put one on each side right there let's do that that's why like this and put one just right there like this you see okay you go this is gonna here there you go you know we could do i said i'll make a complicated and all of a sudden i'm like going to town making a complicated yeah here we go friends all right now very important i got my oven at 400 friends that's the that's the dough the dough cooks at 400 okay so there's no other way around this is usually when the dough is beautiful golden brown my friend when the dough is beautiful golden brown you are uh um medium rare where okay so if you like them all down the only way to get them all down because the dough is done the dough is down you know the dough is beautiful golden brown you got to be out of there um if you like it more if you like a well down then all you have to do is pre-cook it remember when i sealed it in a pan really quick you don't want to see it really quick you want to take your time to to cook it a little bit more otherwise by the time your dough is cooked you're going to have a medium rare okay all right friends so now if you're not sure you can put a thermometer in there there'll be nothing wrong with it you can put the same thermometer you use for your turkey and by the time it's 120 degrees you take it out and you'll be perfectly fine okay so it's up to you if you have one of them thermometer don't be shy to use it all right and we're gonna go in and voila my friends that's it oh it's not complicated you could do that right i mean i i i hope i didn't make it look complicated at all because this was not complicated you know what i want to do just a quick little thing just want to make sure oh i'm doing it in this in a cell pad so it does not attach see i just make sure it's nice and finished right there and we're just going to pop it in the oven my friends oh oh thank you please just remind me i always forget i like to put some fleur-de-cella on the outside the floor of the cell it's got to be florida cell otherwise a very coarse salt would work wonderful it gives you a nice crunch you know there's a little black spot it's probably from a little bit of the excel see if i can remove it without messing up there's another piece right there it's probably a little piece of excel we're going to leave it alone we just won't look at it hyzer all right friends we're going in a 400 degree oven make sure it's 400 degrees right and then we'll see you when this guy's done all right we clean up and then we're done okay friends it's the time we've been waiting for oh yes yes my friends here it is here it is here it is here it is we're gonna let it rest a few minutes friends because as you know when you take a meat out of the oven you want to make sure you give it time for the inside juice to be distribute side otherwise if you cut it we're going to lose all those really important juices so let's just uh wait a few minutes we're gonna wait about 10 minutes it's plenty hot nothing's gonna happen to it and then we're gonna cut it i'm gonna move it right there on my cutting board you see the fact that it was on the sill pad nothing sticks and uh it smells amazing all we're gonna do and i'll cut it and i made this um mushroom sauce and already released that video folks and uh i added some black truffle oil to to fit beautiful with it and it's a tarragon sauce and we already released that mushroom sauce so you can go on youtube we'll put your link and you can see it we're going to wait for this to rest about 10 minutes before we cut it okay friends let's cut into it i have a two knife i have this uh double serrated um uh knife that is fabulous for french baguette uh but it's not gonna be so good for the meat so maybe i'll just cut the dough with it so it's a nice cut of the dough you know what maybe i'll go all the way through otherwise i was going to use my slicer but it's going pretty well so i think we're going to be pretty fine all we got to do now at this point my friends is look at this beauty look at this beauty friends it's gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous we let it rest a good 10 minutes we lost a little bit of uh oh hold on we lost a little bit of uh of of juice but you know it could be from the mushrooms also so but otherwise it's perfect it's it's just the way i like it um you know just the way i like it some people like more rare than they cook a little less we're just going to take a slice right there my friends and this is a beautiful this is absolutely gorgeous you see look at this look at this my friends this is like perfect i i wouldn't want to cook less than this or more than that but that's my puffer oh let me let me put it right here that's my personal preferences you know you can do it less you can do it more it's really up to you my friends but this is a beauty this is right there my friend of beauty and i i like it just to that's it just like this and this with a little sauce right there my friends and you don't have to put the sauce okay this is this is not necessary to have a sauce in here but i think it's just gorgeous it's up to you if you want the sauce on it or not maybe we can put a little a split of of targong to finish it but this right there is perfect so you know what i'm going to do i'm just going to test it my friends because that's the best part of the of the whole thing is to be able to test it and it looks perfect it looks gorgeous i'm very happy very happy with it it's just you know you can't leave the rest too long otherwise it gets cold so we did everything we could possibly do to make sure we didn't drop much juices but this right there is absolutely gorgeous so the best part of the uh the moment is for me to get into it and so i'm going to try right now my friends and i'm just going to try a little a little bit oh look at this look at this look at this i could almost cut it with a fork my friends look at this this is absolutely gorgeous like to try to get the dough to get the meat look at this

4kYC5V2tbCE.json;[Music] hi guys yasas ricardo steve to another episode of dimitra's dishes today we're going to be making a roasted leg of lamb greek style it's going to be easy delicious and the perfect main course to serve for easter time or for a spring get-together let's get started okay so you're going to need one leg of lamb that's between seven to eight or nine pounds have your butcher clean it up a little bit and remove a little bit of the excess fat if you prefer it that way and then what you're going to do is with a sharp knife you're going to cut slits into it because this is going to hold garlic slivers and it's going to add so much flavor it's also going to help the marinade penetrate through all that lemon and oregano it's just going to go inside and flavor it and it's going to be so delicious okay so once you do that set it aside and then you're going to take some garlic cloves and you're going to cut them so that way they fit in between those little slits and you know me the more garlic the merrier you put as much as you like in there okay so i already cut the slits i'm gonna put the garlic in there last because i'm gonna have to flip this around to get all the marinade off and lots of lemon juice you need at least a third of a cup i like to put a little bit more this is a really big piece of lamb and not only does lemon juice add lots of nice tangy fresh flavor but it also cuts the gaminess of the lamb because lamb does tend to be a little gamey but you put as much as you like on there i'm just gonna put a tiny bit of olive oil maybe three four tablespoons because again lamb is a very fatty cut of meat so you don't want this to be too greasy i used to put more back in the day but i really cut the amount of oil that i use when i'm cooking with lamb then i'm going to season it with salt i generally my general rule of thumb with salt is half a teaspoon per pound of meat so this is seven pounds you're going to need about three to four teaspoons then oregano is another great flavor that really helps it really complements lamb dried oregano if you get greek oregano it's delicious we're going to put a few fresh rosemary sprigs in here i'll just put these are big so i'll just cut them in half just like that so before we season the back side of the lamb let me just get the onion in here too the onion is going to help create a nice sauce and it's going to add sweetness and really good flavor now i'm using a red onion but you can use any onion that you have just quarter it and put it in here and i'll put two if you have a smaller cut of lamb one onion will be enough i'm just going to flip it over and season the other side as well i'll use my clean hand to touch the salt and also put some dried oregano and you can put garlic on the back side too but what i'm going to do for the bottom of the pan is even though there's going to be plenty of garlic in the in the lamb itself i am going to put a few cloves down here so they can cook underneath the lamb and now i'm going to take these little slivers of garlic and stick them in the slits that i've cut and you can season the garlic slivers with a little bit of salt and oregano too if you want to it'll just add more flavor and the funny thing is i cut the slits and now i can't see them so i'll just cut a few more [Music] so all of the garlic is in and now i'm going to add a cup of water to the bottom of the pan that's going to help it cook evenly [Music] and then the only thing that i forgot was some freshly cracked black pepper and you guys will be very happy to see that i do have a new pepper mill i've been out of one for a while and have been using already ground pepper and honestly nothing beats freshly ground you could actually smell the essential oils smells different tastes better just took me a while to get one anyway some freshly ground pepper on top if you want to you can sprinkle some crushed red pepper flakes now i am going to go and grab some in a second so i'm going to sprinkle some crushed red pepper flakes all on top that is optional then i'm going to take a piece of parchment paper it protects from touching the it protects the meat from touching the foil and i'm going to cover this tightly with aluminum foil my oven is preheated to 350 degrees fahrenheit this is going to bake in there roast in there nice and slow it's gonna take at least three hours for it to be ready i like the meat really nice and soft and almost falling off the bone so i'm just gonna keep an eye on it every oven works differently keep an eye on it again like i said it's going to take about three to four hours sometimes it's ready in a little bit under that maybe two and a half hours but hardly ever so i'll show you what it looks like as soon as it's out so the lamb is ready it took a little over four hours because this was a really big cut what i did at the end once it was done you definitely want to go in and start checking it at the three and a half hour mark keep it covered until it is fork tender and almost falling off the bone the meat should be really nice and soft then what i did i learned a trick for my mom for the last five minutes i just turned the broiler element on so the top can get a little bit nice and golden brown and crispy while the inside is going to be really nice and juicy while the lamb was cooking in the oven i also prepared some lemony potatoes all i did was i peeled some russet potatoes and quartered them put them on the sheet pan and i poured some lemon juice on them olive oil seasoned with salt pepper and oregano tossed everything all together i also put a little pinch of crushed red pepper flakes on top and then i poured a little bit of water on the bottom so it could help them cook and i just put them in the oven and let them cook alongside the lamb it took them about an hour and 20 minutes potatoes are ready when they're fork tender you can definitely make this whole meal a few hours ahead of time before your guests arrive and then just warm everything through right before you put it on the table to serve it this would all go great with some spanakopita some tzatziki also a mediterranean rice pilaf would be really nice and i did make all of those things i'm going to get ready to set the table you guys head on over to the website www.demetriousdishes.com make all these recipes they're delicious call call your family and friends over if you can and share them because sharing is caring in my world let me take a little taste of the lamb first before i move it over to the table let me make sure i get some of the sauce too the onions pretty much melted you can definitely put the onions alongside like that or even puree everything and make like a little light gravy to go alongside so lemony so bright and that garlic inside has melted so it just flavored the meat so much the the oregano and the rosemary add so much freshness and cut the gaminess of the lamb this is a recipe that you're going to love it reminds me of easter time at my mom and dad's house my dad used to make a big huge whole lamb on the spit and it has all the same flavors i hope you guys start this tradition with your family at home and you enjoy it thank you guys so much for spending time with me today i'll see you all next time yes;['segundos']
5HfZ_u5pqLg.json;well hello dear friends welcome again to another fantastic show we got the beef right here folks for those of you then may have seen um how i prepare those roasts if you haven't seen it go to the channel and look for how to prepare a beef tenderloin how to tie a beef tenderloin i don't know what we called it but it's in there because this is really cool okay this is the chateaubriand this is the center cut didn't need the tile but i tied it anyway it doesn't need to be tied this is the center cut of the filament you know okay this is how it goes boom boom like this okay and the tail end right there already ate it okay but it was the tail end but if you watch the um how to prepare the whole tenderloin i take it out of the cryback and i clean it up and i do all this i show you how to do it okay so you got to watch it all right but now all we're going to do friends we're going to cook it very simple okay now a beef tenderloin now if i'm doing a rib roast i'm going to do the reverse here where i start slowly and then i finish it at the end of it across a beef tenderloin i probably cook thousands of in my career and i'll tell you i love it with a beautiful crust very simply put it in the pan and pop it in the oven and rotate it constantly twist it around turn it around it's fabulous uh we uh put the salt already last night so this is 24 hours sold the salt where you put it in and if you haven't watched the steak video watch this tech video we talked about all that i'm not going to go over details about that anymore because for those of you that watch the video i don't want to be redundant i'm already with them than too often so we put the salt on it overnight and and it's pretty dry change color it gets a little darker and this is obviously a much bigger piece than this one this one's going to cook in about 12 minutes uh depends how you like a cook i would say about 12 minutes and this one is probably going to take 18 minutes we're going to found out we're going to go exactly we're going to time it and we're going to ride it on the recipe i got cast iron pan with um uh uh avocado oil in it you could put uh a clarified butter but you don't get as good of a crust so i got a high smoke point avocado oil in there it gives it a really nice crust and that's what we're looking for in here the beautiful crust okay so and we're going to do both of them in separate pan and the reason why i did this one here remember this is the whole head it's the head of the tenderloin see right there this is the head of the tenderloin if i don't tie it it's not going to cook evenly the reason why i did this because i wanted to show you when you do a tenderloin you don't just use the chateaubriand you use the whole thing and and you're going to be amazed i cut it it looks like one perfect piece of meat when really this is about three pieces of meat at the head of the tenderloin if you clean one people said oh cut that up in stew meat that is no good for stew meat absolutely not okay salt we don't need pepper we're gonna add some we're gonna add some in a little while we're gonna put it in the pan the temperature of my oil is about 360 400 degrees 360 365. make sure it's really hot we're going to yeah well i'm not exactly at 360 yet so i'm not going to touch it for a minute until it gets there and this guy right there and then we so remember got the salt already in there so i don't need the salt anymore uh all right now all we're gonna do we're gonna put it in and we're gonna keep rotating it okay if you don't have a cast iron pen don't worry get yourself a nice big stainless steel pipe okay and the idea is to keep moving it around keep moving it around we're going to create a really really nice cut you want to reverse sears you can do it but i'm going to do the rib roast and i'm going to show you all about that for those of you that have been asking oh by the way when you put the salt you do it overnight you do it on a rack so it gets air circulation for you a lot of you have been asking about sous-vide we will do a sous-vide whole collection of recipes i'm testing some machines right now which one i like which one i don't like better so we're gonna test them and then i'll come up with some results i'm gonna say this is the favorite machine this is how we do it and then i teach you all about it okay all right so look we're gonna start there we're going to get a golden brown on our side you put it in a pan but remember for the first two minutes three minutes don't touch it why because you want the protein to release themselves so it doesn't stick it creates a better crust i promise you okay every day you can flip it around you can flip it all you want after you give it a nice crust by all means do flip it but until you give it a good crust don't touch it okay so see right there sticking a little bit and if you're sticking what happens is when you stick it you bruise the the crust you're gonna be making that's why i don't want to flip it too much okay when you have a crust on it don't worry you can flip it all you want my fact i want you to flip it when you have a whole crust in there all right see sticks a little bit we're going to leave it across so i'll tell you what we don't want to make the video too long friends so i'm going to continue doing this off camera so the video is not for three hours because you're going to take time to do this i want you to take the time to do it and then we'll come back when it's nice and golden brown we're going to pop them in the oven okay all right friends you see took about four or five minutes i'm keeping flipping and look look see constantly flipping it all the way around it and now my oven is preheated at 450 degree friends 450 degrees i'm going to put them both in but both in the oven and i'll come back and i'm going to show you how to flip them we're going to flip them okay well we're going to continue flipping here's one and here's number two oh that pen is heavy all right we'll check temperature and we'll be back when they're ready all right i'm gonna flip him now friends oh yes all i gotta do is just flip him completely on the other side i'll do that every two or three minutes and uh and flip them on the other side two or three minutes to flip on the other side so they cook evenly on all sides all right i'll be back in a few minutes all right friends i'm gonna take the little one out i'm gonna take the little one out i'm gonna let it rest for a little while we're gonna let it rest and uh let's look at the time so we'll make sure we'll publish the time exactly how many minutes it's been and uh because it's really important it depends the temperature of your oven friends but we write that on on on the recipe based on the size of it very important we're going to let it rest uh i took it out at about 118 degrees we're gonna let it rest and now we can make a quick little pen sauce while we're waiting for the other one um there's quite a bit of uh a fat in there and uh we can get rid of some of that fat friends let me get a cup in here i'm gonna get rid of some of that fat right there some of that oil right there just a little bit and we're going to make a very simple pen sauce there's a lot of goodies in there so i got some that's what we're waiting for the other one to uh plus we're waiting for this guy to rest right we're going to make a really really quick pen sauce friends and uh i got some shallots chop right there very very simple this is a quick pen sauce right we have some beautiful sauces that we are starting to publish you know we did the sauce collection as we promised we're starting to build it we made a beautiful mushroom sauce that would be delicious with this so we are just making a really really quick pen sauce right here very simple friends for the glaze all this with beautiful shallots sphere of shallots use onion perfectly fine whatever herbs you want to use you know one of my favorite herbs is targo but sage is wonderful rosemary is wonderful thyme is wonderful use whatever herbs you want to use in here you could put a garlic in there too if you wanted to and we're going to reduce just a little bit of red wine in there you don't want red wine don't worry don't put the red wine in there just put your broth in here this is just a really quick pen sauce this is not complicated did i say put a red wine in there yeah put our red wine in there remember whenever you're cooking with wine friends you want to let it reduce reduce reduce reduce this is like a a two-minute spin sauce let the wine reduce and then we're gonna put a little bit of stock in here when the wine is reduced we're gonna let it reduce reduce reduce we're gonna put a bit of a i crushed some black pepper so i didn't have to turn i'm going to put a little bit of black pepper in here and don't be afraid of putting black pepper in here friends we're going to wait we're not going to cut it yet got to wait about 10 minutes you got to wait about 10 minutes at least 10 minutes and the idea explained i'll explain so you understand it all right we're going to let this reduce now friends let me explain you why what happened is the outside where the crust is all the muscle fibers are released off their juices there's no more juices in there because at that temperature when you put them in a pan at 365 400 degrees all the juice escape so now all the juices are in the middle of it then juice in the middle the meat is 120 degrees they can hold all the juices in the world when you let a rest then it gets to 130 135 then the juice can come from the inside and redistribute more so the muscle fiber on the outside can now take a little more juices and that's how you do it if you cut it right away all the juices are in the middle because the juice goes in the middle they don't go in the middle they stay in the middle that's where all the juices eat so if you're cutting you lose all that juice give time for some of that juice to go back on the outside that has lost all of its juice when you were cooking it and when you were uh uh brining it and when you sauteed in a pan you lost a lot of the juices so now let that juice redistribute from the center into the outside so when you cut it's going to be nice and juicy all right so we're going to let that rest we're going to get that reduced and then in a minute we're going to take the other one and the reason why i did both of them i want to show you the difference from the chateaubriand center cut to one then is that the end where everybody say makes two meters this is the head of the tenderloin and and the tail you can use both of them the secret it's the time very carefully and exactly what we did so we're going to show you what it looks like it all right we're going to let that reduce and we're going to come back in a few minutes and take the big one out all right friends we're going to take out the big one now and this one was in there oh a lot longer uh so we're gonna write down the uh the measurement the uh the time exactly and uh and don't be afraid friends everybody's like oh my mommy you poked all the juices out no you don't you know you don't talk you poke just a little bit of the juice out so little you'll never know in a million years don't be afraid this is very very uh big and and and uh you you take a thermometer it's much easier now it's easier if you have a little stick you can kind of guess what it's going to be but a big roast like that i'd rather you take a thermometer my friend okay and don't be afraid right now i'm looking at uh about 120. i'm looking for about 120. oh yes you got to be careful not to go too much i'm 121 right now 120 121. okay i'm going to let her rest a little bit again same deal you got to let it rest you cannot cut them until you let it rest okay so and the idea of this is to show you then you can use the head of the tenderloin like you can use the tail the same exact way you can use the center cut all right we're going to let those guys rest okay friends so this one i rested a little bit longer so we're going to cut that one first and then we'll get this one we'll let it rest a little bit longer the pencils that i did for us are very simple just stocks right and shallots and uh and salt and pepper it's just a pencil this is nothing you can add a little cognac to this it'd be delicious little cognac right if you have some if you don't have any cognac then bourbon delicious and i know you got butter just put your butter in there friends just a little butter and remember when you're putting butter what you want to do right you want to mix it up right away so it does not have time to separate it doesn't have time to separate here friends so make sure you put it in right away right there you see and then at the end just a touch of a little tarragon then that's not a time to cook and this is just a plain pen sauce something you can do with that anything fancy right there your pen sauce put it right there on a good snake and at the last minute my friend you pour this make sure you scrape all that goodies out of there you pour this on top of your steak and let me tell you fabulous very simple okay let's look at those steaks now what do we do at this point after these guys rest we're now going to take the twine off it's very simple to take that twine off there is a you know there is a a reason for everything we do very simple to take that wine off flip it on the other side grab the the twine right there flip it this way and now you notices i'm pulling on it right so you pull and you cut you pull and you cut you pull and you cut you put it down put it down grab this and voila all in one piece all right we're going to do the same thing over there you grab it flip it on the other side you cut and pull cut and pull and you pull at the same area friends cut and pull cut and pull very very simple just like this so now we're going to cut the chateaubriand the center cut and then we're going to cut this guy too all right so the first thing you do is take this chaturang right there friends and radar you got a beautiful now you have a crust on the outside but it's perfectly cooked as far as amla as far as i like it it's perfectly cooked for me okay you want a more cooked you cook a little bit longer you want less cook you're cooking a little bit less right now i want to show you the whole idea was to show you about this guy this guy right there is uh it's the head that is attached to the rest of the body and that's what most people throw away there well let's throw that away we don't need it we don't need it we're going to make stew out of it no we're not we're gonna make a roast out of it and if you cut right into it you see right there my friends you also got the perfect cut right there you see now this piece right here remember we tied this guy together but if you notice carefully you can't really see you know i mean they cook the same but remember this was tied together this piece was tied together and you can't really tell it was tied together you see right there that's the whole idea of tying it really really really nice and tight you see and so the center cut the chateaubriand beautiful and this is the head that normally people tell you to make a stew out of it i don't make no stew out of it this is perfect so you can serve this with your um pen sauce that i just made a couple of minutes some vegetables some roast this is beautiful really simple so now remember you can use the whole tenderloin you don't have to use just the chateaubriand you can use the head and you can use the tail the way i showed you how to cut it that's it i hope you like this segment remember subscribe to our channel don't forget to give us the thumbs up and don't forget to ring the bell you'll get a notification every time i put on a new video hope you enjoyed this wonderful video thank you for watching we'll see you next week [Music];['segundos']
5RJygAU7uNQ.json;I am ready to make some ribs is there anything better than baby back ribs that literally fall off the bone I don't think so and today I'm going to show you my foolproof never-fail method for making barbecue baby back ribs that are so tender you pick one up the meat literally just falls off and these are just as good done on the grill in the summer in the oven in the winter today I'm going to use the oven which is preheated to 300 degrees and the first thing we do is prepare the meat so if you have a sharp knife I actually just take this fat and I just get rid of it as much as you can you just get rid of it nobody needs it this is what causes all the heart the heart disease and everything so just take off as much as possible and you'll see that you do will not need any of this fat to make these ribs tender so the next thing I do after I take as much fat off is you have to take off that sort of the silver membrane on the back you need a sharp knife and a paper towel and you just kind of get under find a little place to get under that membrane see right here you get under it and then you grab it here it cut it a little bit more you grab it with a paper towel and it should peel right off let's see what happens this is what you want the paper towel otherwise you can't get a hold of it so see how that peels off perfect well almost perfect but that's what happens okay some of its coming off then you have to go back and get the rest sometimes it all comes off at once but this is reality and the reality is it doesn't always come off at once so you have to there it goes there now we got it paper towel okay I'll cut each one just cut it apart and and again the membrane that I took off is what's going to make these kind of fall apart some people want to be able to chew on them a little bit if that's the case you can leave that membrane on but I like them just super super tender and falling off the bone okay I'm down to the last one there it is okay all cut all right now they need a little bit of something acid to help them tenderize and so I use lemon so I have a lemon here I'm going to cut that in half and you just I just kind of just put lemon on them all over and just rub them with lemon both all sides I think this is a pretty nice big lemon so I don't need any more than that and I just kind of rub make sure they're all covered with this nice acidic fresh lemon juice okay all right now the next step is the rub I make my own rub you can use a store-bought order your favorite rub this is how I make mine and I have all the spices out here already and I have my brown sugar so my recipe is it's a core it's a quarter cup of brown sugar right here and then I add here's all the spices two teaspoons each of chili powder and paprika a teaspoon of salt mustard and oregano 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper okay so that's all it I'm gonna put this all in thank goodness for flexible cutting boards look at that okay all right so that's it you just kind of mix it up a little bit if I can avoid cleaning up I'll put them on I'll put the rub on my foil here and we're gonna start to dip these into the into the rub I like to actually press it on if you press that rub right on you look at this press it and it's right there that's that's what you want but because I cut the ribs look I can do the sides and the ends and everything and then I just kind of rub it on that side I place them in this foil like I said the meaty side down and it's going to be a little crowded but they will shrink up a little bit after they once they cook so now we're gonna cover this with foil and you cover it shiny side out okay because you want this slow cook so here at the shiny side the shiny side up the dull side towards the meat and just tighten that foil up really really well and then you have your preheated oven at 300 degrees you flip them in the oven for two and a half hours okay after two and a half hours here's what you're gonna have look at this awesome look at that all right so now as you can see a lot of the fat and stuff has cooked off it's down there in the bottom so we're gonna get rid of some of that I'm just gonna pour that off we don't need it I'll pour it off as much of it that comes off okay and now all that's left to do is to finish them with some sauce now if you're going to finish them on the grill because they're so tender I usually have to use like some kind of a basket or a tray like this because otherwise when you start turning them they'll fall through but in the oven we just leave them right in here that's why I like to do the oven so much leave them in here you set your oven to broil at this point but leave the rack in the middle don't move it up leave the rack in the middle and we're gonna baste and I have my own barbecue sauce that I make that I love and my recipes on the website but you can use any sauce that you like I like kind of a sweet sticky sauce and now we're gonna baste and it's just I'm telling you wait till you see okay there's the sauce now they go in the oven that's now set to broil the rack is in the same spot right in the middle and about five minutes per side we'll check it in about three or four minutes then we'll turn them over and they'll be done oh my goodness oh look at that can you hear it can you smell it and you see it alright now we're gonna turn these over and base them but here's the thing if you start turning them with tongs or a fork or something they're gonna break because they're so tender I actually put on a pair of kitchen gloves clean out of the package and these are thicker because they're hot but it's much easier to handle them because they're very very tender at this point so we're just gonna turn them over can use look at this look at that it's just Oh God alright so we'll turn them all over and again you can see how that meat is just coming off so and you'll be glad you use this disposable foil or something foil lined because it does the broiler definitely makes kind of a in there look at how to see this what I'm talking about look at this and I'm handling it with gloves and it's falling apart now we're gonna base this side this is the meaty side so back in your broil broiling oven the thing about this is - as you can actually look at this they handle the heat so well you don't they don't get that hot okay back in there four to five minutes and they're done oh look at this I can actually handle this with these gloves cuz they're nice and thick but look at that I'm telling you there are no words to describe how awesome these are they're very hot so I still have my gloves on I'm just gonna pick one up and show you how okay oh it's still cooking you do want to let them sit for a couple minutes but just look at this all right that's that's okay that's it if you make these ribs you're gonna make somebody really really happy hi sweetheart guess what I made for dinner those baby back ribs that fall off the bone and they're right here I love you too sweetheart;['segundos']
6HyT4aHvN7s.json;Beef stew is a classic dinner staple, . especially during those cold weather months. With this recipe, you're in for a treat. Whoa, you're going to love the meltingly . tender beef and amazing smells, it's so good. The best thing about it is everything . is made in one pot. Let's get started. The first thing I'm going . to do is cut the vegetables. I'm going to use a classic mirepoix . which is onions celery and carrots. It's going to add a ton of flavor . dimension and aromatics to the dish. My carrots are peeled and I'm going . to cut them into 3/4-inch pieces. Cutting them into larger chunks . is going to ensure that they   don't break down while they braise in the oven. We need about 2 cups for the recipe. For the celery, we're going to cut . them into 1/2-inch thick pieces. The smaller size is going . to infuse a lot of flavor   into the stew. You need about 1 cup of celery. Trim the top off of the red onion and then . just a little bit of the root end so that it   stays intact and it's easier to cut. Cut it in half and peel off the skin. . Cut the onion into 1 inch thick pieces. We need about 1 cup for the . recipe to make a hearty stew. I like to add some waxy potatoes . like Yukon gold into the recipe. I don't want them to break down   while they're cooking in the oven so I'm . going to cut these into 1-inch size pieces. These are baby-sized potatoes, so . I'm just going to cut them in half These types of potatoes have more sugar . instead of starch in them so they're not   going to break down they're actually going . to hold their shape as they're cooking. For this recipe, I'm going to use . beef chuck it's very inexpensive   and it comes from the shoulder region of the cow. It's full of marbling and fat and connective . tissues that are going to be very flavorful   when we braise it. So I have about 2 1/2 pounds of meat . but you could use up to 3 pounds   and we're going to cut them . down into smaller pieces. You want to trim off any extra   fat on the outside because it's just . going to make the stew really greasy. Okay, just cut these into smaller 1 1/2-inch   pieces. See there's big chunks of fat right . there so I'm just going to trim that off. I'm going to season the beef with 1 teaspoon of . kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Just flip the meat over so . you can season both sides. I had refrigerated my meat before I cut . it so it's really dry on the surface   but make sure if it's a little bit wet, use paper towels to dry it off because we want . the beef to sear and not steam in the pan. Let's go ahead over to the stove Set the oven rack to the lower . third position, heat to 350 degrees. Heat a large dutch oven over medium-high . heat, add 3 tablespoons olive oil,   once hot add the beef in a single . layer, work in two batches. Sear each side until browned . about 1 to 2 minutes per side.   Transfer to a clean plate and . repeat with the remaining beef. The beef is done searing when it has a beautiful   caramel-colored crust and there's a . ton of fond or brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan that we're going to dissolve, . that's going to add a lot of flavor to the dish. Now in the same pot, we're going to saute the . vegetables and add the rest of the ingredients. Turn the heat down to medium, and add . 2 cups of carrots, 1 cup of celery, and 1 cup of onion, saute until the onions . are lightly browned and tender, five minutes. Add 1 teaspoon chopped thyme, and . bay leaf, saute for 30-seconds. Add 1 tablespoon minced . garlic, saute for 30-seconds. Wow, this smells amazing already. The . onions are getting caramelized and   the garlic and thyme are really nice and . herbaceous and adding a ton of aromatics. Now, I'm going to add some . balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan but it's also going to add this . nice acidity and brightness   and really boost the flavor of the ingredients. Add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, stir scraping the . bottom of the pan to release any brown bits. Cook until most of the liquid . has evaporated, about 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon tomato paste, . stir and cook for 30-seconds. Sprinkle in 1/4 cup of flour, . stir and cook for 1 minute,   slowly stir in 3 cups of beef stock . scraping down the bottom of the pan. As a finishing touch to the stew, . I'm going to add some dry red wine. I like a full-bodied red wine like . a cabernet sauvignon because it has   really fruity flavors and nice balanced tannins but you could also use a merlot, . a chianti, or a French bourgeois, but make sure you use one that you like to drink   because you'll have a few glasses . left over to enjoy with your meal. And if you don't want to add wine you could also . add grape juice instead or even pomegranate juice or you could just add an extra cup of beef . stock if you don't want to add that at all. Add 1 cup of red wine, and 2 . tablespoons soy sauce, stir to combine. Add the brown beef and 1 pound of sliced potatoes,   bring the liquid to a rapid simmer . over medium-high heat for five minutes. Turn off the heat. I've simmered the stew just for a few minutes to . get the starches in the flour to start thickening   and to keep that liquid nice and . hot before we add it to the oven. The oven is going to give a . nice consistent amount of heat,   cooking the stew by conduction and it . allows you to not have to touch it at all. We're just going to put the cover on and you're . going to bake it for about 75 to 90 minutes or until the meat is super fork-tender and the . vegetables can be easily pierced with a knife. You can also cook the stew . on the stovetop but there's   going to be little pockets of heat that build-up so make sure to stir it . about every 20 minutes or so. Wow, this looks incredible . the meat is fork-tender,   all the vegetables are ready, . and if you want a thicker sauce you could turn the heat up to . medium-high and concentrate   it for a few more minutes until . you get the desired consistency but this looks good to me it's ready to serve. Okay, let's take a peek. Wow, the meat and vegetables are glazed . with the sauce, it smells amazing. Okay, right before serving I like to garnish with a little bit more freshly . cracked black pepper and some chopped parsley. You can grab some serving . bowls and just enjoy it as is or if you want a heartier meal   I would definitely serve it with my . homemade mashed potatoes right here. I hope you enjoyed learning . the science behind beef stew,   and if you did please give it a big thumbs up it means a lot when you do. See you in the next video. It's time to eat.;['segundos']

78sXLnIy9dM.json;[Music] hi welcome to Chris cook for you too today we're going to be baking chicken now a lot of people that came to me and asked me how do you bake chicken in the oven it's really really simple and baking I'm going to be making chicken legs but baking chicken legs or chicken quarters if you use the same procedures as if people baking a whole chicken so you can take what I'm doing today and you can apply it to baking a whole chicken the only difference is I'm going to show you how to clean these chicken legs as well so let's get started with the ingredients that you're going to need in order to bake chicken you're going to need of course two chicken legs and I'm using these chicken quarters and if you're doing a whole chicken then you just need your whole chicken or whatever pieces it is that you're going to use now your seasonings can vary and you wouldn't use the same ones that I'm using or you can use the same ones that I'm using a lot of times you can get away with just using this to bake and this will make your chicken real good if you want chicken that has more flavor to it then you can get off into more seasonings here is the basic chicken seasoning that you would need when baking your chicken you would need pepper salt onion powder garlic powder and paprika now if you want to branch out into more seasonings you can and use whichever ones that you would like but to this I'm going to add poultry seasoning and I want to add adobo seasoning now this will make your baked chicken taste very very good but if you want to get off into using other seasonings if you want to use rosemary if you want to use some anything that you want to use them may be different you can use rosemary you can use a hint of sage you can use some parsley you can use anything that you like but these are just basics that I use for baking chicken so I'm going to go way meet you at the sink for showing you how to clean your chicken quarter be ready anywhere okay now I'm at the sink and there's several things really that you need to know about cleaning our chicken legs I should have just done a whole segment on just getting them clean but let me just go ahead and do just I guess a mini version of what I'm going to do first of all you have to get all this fat you see the fat that's going along the side of the chicken then you have to get that off because that's too much excess fat on the side of the chicken now there's a part here you only see a little part of it with this particular piece of chicken but that's the butt end of the chicken if you don't eat it then you can just go ahead and cut it also if you do eat it then you can leave it there sometimes you will see hairs on the chicken these are just the feathers that came from them when they clean the chicken you want to get all of those feathers off of the chicken any excess skin like this there's a lot of chicken feathers right there but any excess skin you don't really need it now if you want to eat as you can but I always take it off and then there's a part in the back and this is crucial you see that part there's a little bitty break in where that that backbone is right there so you want to clean that out just take your thumb and your thumb will slide all the way through there and you want to clean out all of that little extra book and sometimes there's extra slime on the chicken so you want to get that chicken you know all of that slime out of there as well now once you do that if this chicken is too large for your family all that excess fat that excess fat you want to get out okay and you want to throw it out now if this chicken is too big of a piece then you got children and it's too big of a piece for your children there's a way to know how to cut the you see where that fat runs dead down there that's where you cut it there's a little piece of fat try to show you on another you will always see it see that little line of fat that runs down there and this is the slam I was talking about see that's just lining you want to get it off but you see that little piece of fat that's how you know where to cut this chicken quarter if you want to make two pieces out of it now I'll show it to you I'm going to come straight down that okay now I got two pieces okay you come straight down that that part and you'll always go through that bone I'm going to do it again let's take this one see it there it is right there and I saw all of your chicken quarters come straight down see and you'll hit it every time okay try it one more time then I'm gonna leave it alone see it there it is right there come straight down because that's exactly where your bone is so you want to come straight through it now on here you see that I deviated just a little bit when I see it go in but that's exactly where you want to be cutting at now I still have to clean all of that but I just wanted to show you that now here see the back of that you don't want to eat that so you take it out all of that you don't want to eat that so you take it out now the best type of chicken broth is when you're baking your chicken why is this the best chicken broth because when you bake chicken you don't add water to it you just put it in the pan with your seasoning and it's going to create its own juices and the juices that you're going to get from this that chicken broth that you're going to get it's going to be straight chicken broth with nothing added no water or anything sometimes when you ball where every time you boil your chicken you're adding water to it in order to boil it so you're diluting what would be your chicken broth this way you get the straight chicken broth look at all that fat you don't want it so any place that you see excess fat just go ahead and take it off now look at the fat is a good thing because that's going to help to create your chicken broth so a little bit of fat you don't worry about it but an enormous amount of fat take it up and see that's the lamb that was what I was telling you about that you don't want to eat excess skin it don't want it take off we cleaned out that back any more fat left take my thumb just going and give it that little piece if it's the last part over the fence which is the piece that I showed you don't see it see if I can find one here's one right here see if you don't eat that and just cut it off you can save it and make some chicken broth with it if you want to or you can just go ahead and use the chicken ball but this is the best chicken broth so don't throw away this it's going to be a lot halfway through the cooking process and I'll show it to you but don't throw it away freeze it excess fat just take it off that that you can't get off with your hand just get your knife go ahead and take it off okay and it's lamb but anything that you see that you don't want look at that yeah I went right and then got it put your thumb right in there the tick all of it out let me take all of that and you toss it now a lot of people don't clean their chicken because they don't know how to do it or whatever reasons they don't clean it but I do so if you want to start cleaning your chicken this is the way to do it I'm going to cut one more piece if you like skin leave it on I don't need it so I'm taking it off invest in you a good pair of these cutting shears they only like three ninety-nine and that's a great thing to have in your kitchen when you're going to be cutting stuff now this one is clear it is very clear see that that is very clear you can see it so all your chicken legs before I do it though take some of this oh okay now I'm going to go straight down there watch it then when I go straight down don't cut it you know this chicken is slamming because I got my hands out here see that got me to pieces out of that I see a little bit more slime get it off and then I will get this little bit of fat okay a lot of people ask me about how you clean it and I just want to show you how you would go ahead and clean it then once you get through taking all of this stuff off of it then you can go ahead and wash your piece of chicken now I had the rest of this to do down in here so I'm going to go ahead and do it and then I'm going to season this I'm going to bake it off uncovered in my oven 350 degrees what I will do first is I will cover this chicken for the first probably 45 minutes of cooking what it does is if I have it covered it's going to go ahead and produce the chicken broth that it means too because it's actually steaming down the chicken there's going to be no water in this at all the only thing I'm going to have is just my chicken pieces with the seasonings on top so that means I'm going to get some good broth that I can use at a later date so I'm going to put this in my 350 degree oven allow it to cook covered for that first what 45 minutes maybe of cooking and then I'm going to take that cover off and let this chicken finish cooking why am i doing it that way because at that time I want my chicken to brown on the top and I want my chicken to have a crispy tight topping on it I don't want it to be very very crispy like just something like bacon I don't want it like that but I want it to brown and I'm the the top of it to be more crisper than the inside and I want the inside to be tender so I'm going to go away finish cutting up this chicken and finish going ahead and clean in my chicken and then I'll bring your back midway through the process of me cooking the chicken just to show you the broth and to remove the broth wait until it cooled and in freezer for a later date and continue to cook the chicken so I'll be back just went to show you that okay now I'm at the stove and I'm getting ready to put my chicken in the oven my oven is go on 350 degrees and like I told you I'm going to put this in the oven let it cook for the first 45 minutes on top of it I want to show you there's absolutely no water in this pan a little bit of drainage you see which is a very small amount it's coming from you know just a chicken having being put in there just already seasoned so I'm going to cover this with a piece of aluminum for now when it seemed the theme is going to arrive the min is going to go back down but that's going to cause the moisture to come from the chicken and that's how you get your chicken broth so that's why I'm allowing this to cook first and cover it up for the first 45 minutes then I'm going to remove it and cook it the rest of the right but when you have it like this your thing will go back down producing moisture and that's what's going to happen give you your your chicken broth and this is the best chicken broth as I told you to use so make certain that you save that put it up you can freeze it for up to six months so you don't have to worry about it freeze it and use it if you freeze it in your ice cube tray then you can just use one or two kings of chicken broth at a time you don't have to use it all so I'm going to put it in the oven and I'm going to allow it to cook now after 45 minutes I'll bring you back and I'll show you what it looks like when we get ready to drain the juice off or the chicken broth all of the chicken be right back and actually my chicken has been any of for about an hour really because I started to do something else so I just want to take it I'll show you the release of stage getting ready to take this off now I want to show you you see all those liquids down in there remember I told you that these liquids came from the chicken itself okay and these are the best this is the best chicken stock that you're going to get because you remember I added no water to this at all so now I'm going to take the total liquid from the chicken take off the cover which was not in the foil and I'm going to put this back in my oven and let it brown up [Music] okay now port you got just a minimal amount of liquids down in the bottom I poured it off now I'm going to put it back in my oven and I'm going to allow it to brown on top now so what you look at this see how rich that chicken stock is model take this chicken stock and let it cool and then I'm going to put this in my refrigerator and freezer and this is what I'll use for meals to come okay you just want to show you that be right back and show you what the chicken looks like once it Brown maybe about another 30 minutes be right back okay take my chicken out the oven now chicken is ready see my chicken that's why your chicken is supposed to look when you're baking it off my chicken is ready now I can just do my dinner my cabbage is ready back in the back pot heaven cabbage that's ready my dirty rice is ready and my chicken is ready okay just want to show you what I was having for them today I'm not going to dish it up I think that if you try this chicken you're truly going to enjoy it this is my version of bacon chickens you can use whatever seasonings it is that you want to use but as always thank you for watching Krystal for you too don't forget to try to buy [Music];['segundos']
7QSAzTxSamA.json;hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm going to redo a video that I had uploaded a while back this is the fresh baked cod video after I had uploaded it I had to fix a few things and for some reason I cut out quite a bit of the audio it was very choppy and obviously you need to have good audio during a cooking tutorial because you need to know what's going on you're gonna be able to hear who's cooking so I want to review that for you guys a lot of people were asking questions about it and I just figured let me redo it I haven't cooked cod in a while anyway so that sounded really good but if you want to know how I do it then please keep watching I'm gonna show you step by step and it's not going to be a voiceover this time it's gonna be me actually cooking everything and you can see me doing it so you want to know how I do it then please keep watching if you watched my first tutorial on this video you'll notice that it really isn't that hard to make that is if you followed along without the directions of course but I just pulled out my fish from the refrigerator it came in one long fillet I got it from the seafood section at HEB and I am going to cut it in half so I have two nice sized fillets so this is what I have here this is just wild caught cod this is one filet it is probably about close to a pound I'm just gonna cut it in the middle I'm just gonna pick a good place right here and I'm just gonna cut it there we go and they're nice thick slices as you can see I'm going to preheat my oven to 400 degrees we're gonna bake the fish in the oven so I'm just gonna grab a pan and I'm gonna spread a little bit of butter in the bottom that way it doesn't stick so when we're ready to take and serve it on our plate it's not gonna fall apart so I'm just gonna take a little bit of butter just about this much you don't need much and I'm gonna put it in the pan my napkin and spread all around like that we're done with the pants I'm gonna set that aside now I grabbed a bowl like this you can use a regular size Bowl if you want we're gonna work on the the breading so what we're gonna use is some flour we're going to use salt pepper cayenne pepper and some paprika you can also add in garlic salt garlic powder if you want but I'm gonna use fresh garlic so I'm gonna get the garlic salt and powder all together so just once a couple tablespoons of flour just enough to coat the top side of the fish [Applause] next we're gonna add some pepper some crushed red pepper I said cayenne pepper but you can use crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper or whatever you want I'm just gonna use couple teaspoons of that then you're gonna go with your paprika about a teaspoon or so go and then we're just gonna mix it all together now that we're done with our flour mixture I'm going to dice it my garlic so I'm going to move my fish to the pan that we've already coated in butter or you can use a Pam spray or whatever you have just so you make sure it doesn't stick on the bottom set that aside and I'm going to use for right now one large clove of garlic this one is really big was probably equals 3/4 of a tablespoon so I'm going to dice this up nice and fine I didn't do this in the last video but I thought of it this time and I thought that would be a perfect thing to add to the recipe so I am going to zest about half to one lemon and I'm going to add that with the garlic and the butter mixture that I'll show you in a second it's just going to be more like a lemon crusted Cod which is going to be fantastic because lemon goes perfect with the fish so I have two lemons I'm just gonna start with one I'm going to roll it out so the juices get released a little bit and then I am going to use my zester I'm gonna zest that over my garlic and I'll show you what I do from there so please keep watching [Music] and I'm going to lightly butter the top of them so you don't need much and you just want to spread this on top like that actually the knife would be a lot easier so he's your knife I'm left-handed so I have to move the whole thing around a little bit and this is gonna help give it that nice flaky golden crust that's exactly what we're going for for this recipe in particular so just like that and the butter is also going to help the butter mixture adhere a little bit better we're gonna do is add the flour mixture on top of what we just added which was the butter the lemon zest and the garlic so you just want to spoon a little bit over the top like this I'm just gonna Pat it down a little bit like that so it's gonna look something like that my oven is now preheated to 400 degrees so I'm going to stick the fish in because it is almost an inch thick and I only have two fillets in there I'm going to cook it for about 12 to 15 minutes just keep an eye on it if you have a thicker cut of fish or if you have more fillets that you're cooking at one time just eyeball it you may need a few more minutes here and there but you'll know when it's ready is you're going to have that nice golden crust and the important thing is just to make sure it's cooked all the way through I'm gonna grab another cutting board because I am going to mince up my fresh thyme and parsley that I picked from my greenhouse those will be a perfect garnish for the top of it is gonna add a nice freshness to it and the child will also add a nice little bite along with the red pepper so I'm going to dice that up and I'm not going to put that on until I'm ready to eat [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] these are gonna be the lemon slices that I'll serve with it and I'm gonna use these end pieces as what I'm going to squeeze over the top of the fish when we're ready to eat while I'm waiting for the fish to bake I'm gonna get my sides ready I'm gonna do a little side of rice and some vegetables I really enjoy asparagus and Brussels sprouts with fish but I'm sure whatever we have will be just fine so I'm going to get those ready and I'm going to clean up and then when I'm finished it'll probably be time to pull the fish out of the oven and I'll show you how it looks okay so I just took it out of the oven it took about 20 minutes so a little longer than I expected but that's okay that there's a little bit of flour there it was just a little bit of extra I put on probably a little bit too much but it'll dust right off when you bite into it or when you cut it so it looks so good we have the golden crust like I wanted it's nice and opaque so I know it is cooked all the way through so I'm gonna plate it up and I will show you what it looks like and now I am going to squeeze my lemon on top like this I'm gonna add my garnish on top like that and then my lemon and that is what it looks like looks very good to me can't wait to eat it so as you can see the fish did get that nice golden-brown crust it took a little bit longer than I thought but that could have just been the thickness of the fish so I cooked it at 400 for about 20 minutes and I did a side of asparagus and rice and I also topped the fish with a little bit of the chives and parsley and I also squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top and then just put a couple of slices on the side in case you want a little bit more of the lemon juice so I can't wait to dig in I'm very hungry it is a little bit later than usual for dinner but I wanted to film this for you guys and getting it up so if you do try this out please let me know I'd love to see how you do it maybe if you put on Instagram tag me or something so I can see what you do so once again thank you so much for watching I appreciate your support and thumbs up this video if you liked it and don't forget to subscribe I'll see you in the next video bye guys;['segundos']
7r3dlmYUf4s.json;- Hi everyone. It's Natasha with natashaskitchen.com and today we are making. classic beef stroganoff with tender strips of beef and mushrooms in an incredible creamy sauce. This is an easy and. excellent 30-minute dinner. This recipe moves fast so you want to have all of. your ingredients ready to go. We'll start with some quick prep. Thinly slice one pound. of top sirloin steak and for best results use. a high quality steak, a boneless ribeye or beef tenderloin will also work well. Next, thickly slice half a pound of white or brown mushrooms. (music) Also, finally chop half of a medium onion and it may seem like a lot of onion but it shrinks down and. disappears into the sauce. (music) And for our last bit of prep, finally mince one large garlic clove. (music) It is time to fire up the stove. Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add two tablespoons of oil and once the oil is. hot, add the beef strips in a single layer. Seer the beef without moving it around for about one minute per side or just until cooked through. And in case you're wondering, I also have some out. of control egg noodles boiling in the background to. serve with the beef stroganoff. Just as soon as has. seered and no longer red, remove it right away to a separate bowl and cover to keep warm then seer the remaining beef. It does take a couple extra minutes but it is best to seer in batches otherwise the beef can cool. the pan down too quickly, juice out and become chewy. Transfer the rest of the. cooked beef to the bowl and cover to keep warm. Melt in two tablespoons of butter then add the chopped onion. and sliced mushrooms. Saute stirring occasionally. for six to seven minutes or until all of the liquid is evaporated and the onions and mushrooms. are soft and lightly brown. (music) Next, add your minced garlic. clove and saute another minute or until fragrant. (music) Sprinkle the top with. one tablespoon of flour and saute another minute,. stirring constantly. Pour in one cup of beef broth and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan. (music) Next, add three fourths. cup of heavy whipping cream and bring everything to a simmer. Stir a few tablespoons. of the simmering sauce into your sour cream to temper. it so it doesn't curdle. Then add it to the pan. while whisking constantly. Now, stir in one tablespoon. of worcestershire, half a teaspoon of dijon. mustard, and season with half a teaspoon of. salt and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper or season to taste. Bring the sauce back to a. simmer and it should be creamy. Now add the cooked beef back to the pan along with any accumulated juices and bring it back just to a simmer or until the beef is heated through. And once your egg noodles are cooked according to package instructions, drain well and set them aside. until you're ready to serve. (giggles) Oh my goodness. I am so excited for this taste test. Oh yummy. And while the stroganoff was cooking, I made a batch of buttered egg noodles. So those are ready for serving and I am gonna jump right into this. And I love to serve stroganoff with a little bit of a fresh chives because it adds that great. pop of flavor and color. And it goes really well with this so just add a bunch of chopped chives. Wow-y. Lots of chives. You can't go wrong. Alright, okay. I cannot wait any longer. Let's serve up some pasta to start. And this does pair really well. with mashed potatoes or rice because it has that amazing gravy with it but I do love it over egg noodles. Lots of noodles. Okay, alright. And then we want to get as much meat and mushrooms and sauce as possible. (laughs) I'm telling you, it's really good. So saucy. I love that. And it does thicken up. just a little bit more when it cools down and it is just perfect. And now, I'm really hungry. (laughs) Here we go. Little bit of everything. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I tell you what. (laughs) This is seriously the best beef stroganoff and it comes together so easy. The beef is so tender. The sauce is seasoned to perfection and I love the thick sliced mushrooms. They're just as meaty as the beef. This is such a treat. And my kids, they loved it and this always disappears fast. If you guys enjoyed this recipe give me a great big thumbs up below.

9BWYV7iTwSw.json;hello again I'm John Tirzah and welcome to another video cooking lesson Susan cook today I'm going to answer the question in this lesson how to make one way of making chicken fingers or chicken tenders because I happen to be using chicken tenders in this I'm going to keep this concept and this lesson simple and you can improvise it in any way you want on your own but I'm going to use plain white unseasoned breadcrumbs chicken tenders a little salt and pepper and some all-purpose flour and some egg wash which is a combination of three whole extra-large eggs in about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of milk okay now one of the problems that people encounter when they're making any kind of fried chicken dish but in particularly fingers is that they're browned enough when they're being fried to be taken out of the fryer but the inside of them is not cooked yet so if you happen to have a larger piece of chicken that you're making fingers or tenders out of then just whack it a little bit like that to make sure that it's not too thick okay so I'm going to quick wax all of these a little bit cause I want to make sure they're all done perfectly and I don't have to over brown these where it's all said and done you of course can use strips of chicken breast meat or whatever it is you want to use from your to make this or you could use this same application and then method for chicken bites or pieces or nuggets if you will so there I'm going to make sure my chicken all gets cooked and I don't have to over brown to do it now if should happen that you do get stuck with chicken that's browned enough but not cooked inside you can always put it on a cookie sheet to finish baking it in the oven and slow that whole browning process down so I'm seasoning the chicken tenders on both sides with salt and pepper you know everybody loves this of course honey mustard barbecue sauce kind of thing this is what's not the light this is good it's another version of fried chicken okay now we're gonna flour all of these quickly now there's multiple versions of how this gets fried or battered or not battered these can be better in fritter batter they don't have to be breaded but in this case we're breading it they can be double breaded they can be single Brenda they can be egg washed and then floured and then egg wash and breadcrumbs but I'm gonna give you the real basic simple which is plain single dusting of flour shaken loose making sure you get egg all over it egg wash I have made more egg wash what I need because I'm making more after this video is made so let's lay some of these out on some of the plain breadcrumbs and let's put the breadcrumbs on top Pat them down a little bit see I made these kind of flat rectangular in the process of pounding them which makes them absolutely easy to bread because they're they have two sides now and if you want to use extra fine breading this is moderately fine breading that I'm using you could have chunkier breading you can use painful style breadcrumbs if you want now this one I ate it then I'm flowering it like I had suggested and then I'm going to put it back in the egg so you'll have you'll see two different coded versions from what Saul said and done and we will be able to tell the difference of which one is which this one was aged first before it was flowered let's get these and breaded again you can season the breadcrumbs too on top of just seasoning the you see how much more breading that has and the other ones there so this is a way of increasing the breading without necessarily making bigger breadcrumbs and this is our last two this whole videos being done at real time it does not take very much time and effort to make these this whole flour egg breading process that I'm doing here is very typical for a lot of different breaded things like fish and vegetables etc okay alright so let's get these gloves off and let's get these into the fryer I have this fryer set at 350 we're going to start out with the ones that were double dipped first and then we're going to put the single dip once in right behind that we want to make sure that they don't get stuck together so we're gonna fast forward right here for two or three minutes we'll see this is these are gonna be done probably in five minutes so I'll be right back we got about three minutes into them they look good I think they need a little bit more my suspicion is that there might be a little bit of paint left enough still so we'll give them a couple more minutes then about five minutes I think they're done we're going to find out when we cut into one of them so let's get this up cause it's a slippery slope coming up with chicken let's get them on this little child ray now you can tell that that was one of the double-dipped ones you can tell that this is one of the double-dipped ones you can tell that this is a single dip one that's a double dip one and those are that single and that's a single dip on there you see the difference in the clumping of the flower stuff all right so let's get these on well let's let's cut into one of these let's take this one here and cut into it first oh that looks perfect it's got the perfect profile of cooked chicken let's give them a little stack like logs on here and let's put some chopped green stuff whatever you want to put on here parsley chopped spinach chopped scallions whatever so there it is I have a little honey mustard on the side here because we're going to eat this right after the camera stops rolling but I hope I answered the question for you how to make basic chicken fingers or tenders for your special event;['segundos']
9gNzCbOgumw.json;(soft music playing) - Hello, beautiful people. My friends and family, greetings. I hope you all are doing fantastic. Today on the menu is a simple. yet decadent pepper steak here with rice. It is family approved. My children absolutely love it. You and your family are also going to just totally fall in love with this. simple yet decadent recipe. I cannot wait to get started. but before we continue, I know you're already loving this video, so why don't you give me a thumbs up? Your girl is trying here. You need to encourage me to keep bringing you some more good stuff. So, give me a thumbs. up and let's continue. First, let's wash our hands. To begin, let's quickly. go over the ingredients. I have some fresh produce here. I have a green and red bell pepper. I also have one large onion,. three cloves of garlic, about half the size of. my thumb ginger peeled. Now I will be creating a glaze like effect on my meat today. And for that, I'm going. to be needing some honey. This is pure organic honey. I also have some oil. And this is my cornstarch. And I have my chicken seasoning, crushed black pepper, and some soy sauce. This is a combination of. light and dark soy sauce. And of course we can make. pepper steak without the steak. So, the steak is representing. The flank cuts of the steak, and it is very tender. when it is stir fried. So it's the best option. for stir frying by the way. And as you can see the. strands of the muscle are going in a horizontal direction. So to slice it, we're going to slice it against that direction to get really tender. melt in your mouth cuts. First, let's prep our vegetables. All right, friends, the time has come to layer our flavors, and marinate this meat, and get that part going. So I have my meat. It's ready and cut into very thin slices. They're gonna be juicy,. and melt in your mouth. And you're going to cook with really beautiful crusty outer layer. I have some crushed black pepper, and it's really coarsely crushed just now, just before I started. cooking I like to do that 'cause you get the most flavor. And then here is my soy sauce. I'm going to use half. of the entire amount. I have my chicken seasoning. Corn starch. Half of the entire amount again. We're going to create a slurry. So I'm going to use part. of it to create the slurry. Here is the honey. And last but certainly. not the least is our oil. And this is olive oil. Let's not forget our ginger, and garlic. Leave half to prepare the vegetables. You can already tell this is. going to be very flavorful. Nothing better than fresh garlic, and fresh ginger combination on top of a meat like this. You know your stir fry is going to be, mmh, so, so good. For the slurry we're. going to need some water. Corn starch. A little bit of crushed black pepper, and all soy sauce. The remainder of the soy sauce that is. And whisk to combine. Make sure that you don't have any lumps of cornstarch in here. This is going to be a delicious slurry that's going to thicken, and create a sauce around pepper steak. It's nice and smooth, and we're going to get a. really rich color from it. Perfect. So friends, I have a skillet. ready to go onto the stove. I'm going to turn the. heat on to a medium heat. This is what I'm going to. be cooking the meat in, why? Because it's a non-stick, but it's a safe kind of. non-stick cooking ware. So I'm going to cook the meat in it first, transfer it, and then cook the vegetables. And then we'll combine it with the slurry. A small amount of oil. Bring it to a piping heat level, and then we'll place the meat in it. We're gonna get a really beautiful crust. (meat sizzling) (soft music playing) Alright, here we have it. Our steak is ready. It's glossy, it's juicy. And it's absolutely flavorful. I wish you were here to. really smell the aroma. So that portion is done. Now let's work on our vegetables, and finished cooking this pepper steak. (soft music playing) The remainder off the. ginger and the garlic mince. Crushed black pepper. And a little salt. (soft music playing) Fresh garlic and ginger on fresh produce such as these peppers it's a combination made in heaven. Really enhances the. flavor of the vegetables. If you don't like vegetables, trust me cooking your vegetables this way will make you have a change of heart. Now comes all the vegetables. One thing you do not wanna do is over cooked your. garlic and your ginger. You'd want them to still. have that freshness. Look at those colors, oh,. so mouthwatering already. As this stage you can cook your vegetables to your preferred doneness. I really liked a crunch, so I'm not going to. over cook my vegetables. I also want to maintain the vibrant color, 'cause I eat with my eyes first. And I know you all do too. (chuckles) To preserve the vibrant. color of these vegetables I have my heat on the highest level. So I'm cooking on very high heat. Now you're going to add our slurry. Give it a quick stir, 'cause the corn starch has now. settled on the bottom of it. Do a quick stir, pour it in. And it will quickly start thickening. And it comes to a glaze, see that. We're done. We're going to add our meat now. Now here comes the meat. (soft music) Beautiful glaze and a sauce. It has a bit of sweetness. And just like that, our pepper. steak is done. It's ready. A quick taste. Oh, wow! I promised simplicity and yet decadence, and I think we just did exactly. There is that slight bit. of background sweetness that we gained from adding. the honey from the beginning. It is not overpowering. sweetness, believe me, it rather enhances the umami. Umami is a savory glutamate tastes, okay. And it really enhances that taste. Now there is also the. crushed black pepper, which really takes these. flavors to the next level. And not to talk about the. crunchiness of the vegetables, you can see it even before. you put it in your mouth. (soft music playing) Friends, lunch is served, and I have the perfect bite right here. Some pepper, onion, and. of course the stake. And I cannot wait to dig in. I hope this recipe was. simple enough for you. And you also found it to be a decadent one that you're inspired to try. for you and your family. Please be sure to give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed this video. And also don't forget to share. Continue to spread the word. Tell a friend to tell another. Thank you so much for joining us today. I hope to see you soon. And as always make it a. great day and have fun, especially in the kitchen. Mmh, so good. So good. (soft music playing);['segundos']
a9VNVJJR7VI.json;hey guys welcome back I'm Shane Rene and today we're gonna go a little bit higher end I'm gonna do it I'm gonna be cooking a beef tenderloin I'm not gonna call it a chateau buddy your honor because I'm not really using the center almost but not quite so I'm using more of the butt end of it but you know regardless it is you know the Cadillac of the meat world so of the beef world anyway so what I'm gonna make is a beef tenderloin and I'm also going to accompany that with some with a red wine reduction pan sauce and we'll serve that with some some rosemary potatoes roasted rosemary potatoes so really good this is kind of a dish I would make if I was trying to like impress a lady friend or something like that so anyway let me show you how easy this is to do and let's get started okay so this is what we're gonna be using today over here I have some some some red potatoes that I quartered up and we're gonna be using some fresh rosemary with those I have some shallot here using shallot because you know this dish I think it goes best with this this is kind of a mix between flavor wise is kind of between our onion and garlic also we're gonna use some carrots salt and pepper some good olive oil some Merlot and some beef stock and of course the star of the show beef tenderloin when you're using a meat of you know this cut of meat quality you don't have to you know you don't want to cover it and all the kind of seasonings and stuff like that you all you want to use a salt and pepper and you know a nice sauce because why mask you just don't want to mass such a good flavored tenderloin you know such a good cut of meat so I you know I really dislike what people try to blacken or put a rub on a tenderloin it makes me cringe anyway let's go let's go over to the stove yeah so I got my pan heating up starting to smoke I got it on a little little tiny lower than medium-high not much more than that so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and put some oil in my pan so good olive oil not too much I'm gonna go ahead and season this beef make sure you get all sides this will help you know put a nice little crust on it like I said this is all you need to do with a tender long as far as seasoning so into the pan we go so we try to do is get a good sear on all sides I thought you mean see how quick that did that it started to brown a little bit that's from the salt and pepper I'm not gonna cut away from this only because I want you it doesn't take long and I want you to see the whole process about maybe 20 to 25 seconds maybe 30 seconds on each side you can see that one side is done that's pretty right that color this is what I would also do if I was making a beef wellington which I'll make at some point just a little bit you see that stuff sticking on the bottom at I want that I want all these were the particles in there this is all going to contribute to our flavor and our sauce on the skinny side they might just have to hold it a little bit you can use a probe with this dish I'd know how to touch it I can just squeeze it and sell it tell us how you know what's is where is that medium rare medium you know that kind of thing so this is all we want right here nice sear on this meat okay so now what we're gonna do is let that rest okay I'm just gonna kind of put this on the side let it rest and in the same pan we're gonna add our shallot and our carrot and let me tell you so does that hit that pan that smell was crazy crazy good so we just kind of stopped pissed off they did follow up shallots smells so good when they cook them especially in olive oil this is more like you know like I said before it's more of an up up with puppeteer dish you would take quite a bit of this in a restaurant some restaurants would charge about $30 that is just it's not a little bit more I'd have to say if I'm you know if I had to pick one thing I was the best at it's probably cooking me so now you see if you look you just see like it's starting to caramelize just a little bit you've been cooking for maybe four minutes three and a half minutes and that's what that's what I want to see this this sauce is gonna be dark and I want it kind of sweet so not too much but a little bit that carrots the carrots in here they get kind of sweet when you start caramelizing a little bit not to mention that it's just beautiful color I say it's been cooking for about five minutes no more than that so now we're gonna go in with some wine you can tell if somebody in a restaurant knows how to cook if you never hear that sizzle they're not cooking it you're not doing it right all right now we're gonna add some beef stock and I'm gonna go probably a little bit more than half of Japan cuz I'm gonna reduce this by like 75% okay this is gonna end up being all nice and caramely and all right so I'm gonna bring this up to a simmer and I'm gonna lower the heat once it's simmering till about medium-low and we're just gonna let this go and tell it till it reduces til about this much you know this high in the pan about 75% and then while we're doing that while that's simmering we're gonna go and get our potatoes ready all right so I strip the leaves off of the rosemary and this is about 4 or 5 sprigs I'm not gonna go real you know to too fine with this cuz this is fresh rosemary and it's really nice and fragrant alright ok so now what we do is we want to coat our potatoes with olive water I'm gonna hit it with some salt and pepper okay go in what's up with the rosemary okay now we want to do is toss this up real quick all right now that's done that's it on our potato that's pretty right all right so let me show you how we finish these up okay so I have my oven preheated to 425 you can go for 50 depending on how your oven cooks mine is a little hotter than it actually says I think so all we're gonna do you don't to grease this pan because you know the potatoes are greased already all right so it goes nice and spread out okay and now we're just gonna go into the oven these will take probably half hour they're not really that big so they shouldn't take all that long maybe a little less than a half hour but we'll check on them I like to check on stuff about half way it's a good bit of practice to keep you know about 15 minutes I'll come in on peak in the oven and look at them and see how they're doing all right guys you can see how our our sauce is nice up up to a nice little simmer you can see how our tenderloin is sitting over here looking pretty so now what I'm gonna do is turn down this heat to live off to about medium-low and you know every once in a while I'll just kind of come over and move it around this isn't gonna you know we're not skimming this or anything like that what we had in here is olive oil and tenderloin which is not fatty so I just want to tell you how good it smells a little little tip for the guys if you're making this dish and you're inviting the girl over wait till you get to this point okay because right now my kitchen smells nothing but rosemary red wine and beef beef stuff you know nice beef tenderloin smell it smells delicious put it that way all right so now is when we can kind of relax for a minute the potatoes are in our sauce is reducing our filet is chilling out over there so we got about you know 20 minutes to do whatever you want when this is about halfway and the potatoes are done we'll step back in and I'll show you you know how we continue all right guys so our potatoes are done they look beautiful nice little golden brown color yum yum yum oh lord I dropped one that one looks good too oh that's hot all right so this is our sauce what I'm gonna do now is turn it off it's just about where I want it so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit it with just a little more beef stock just to bring it up just a tad I'm gonna go ahead and add our meat to it and I'm gonna spoon a little bit of sauce on it all right [Music] so now I'm gonna turn to turn the oven down to 350 I'm gonna put this in the oven for I don't know it's really really rare right now obviously because it's just sear so this will take about 10-15 minutes I'm gonna check it like I said before if you're not comfortable with touch of meat you know to see where it's at I think they make those like mcdonald temperature things where you just push it in and it says like beef pork chicken or whatever I don't know I've never used one of those but for a nice medium-rare you wanted that about 135 or so but uh we're gonna put this in and I'll show you how it looks guys I just pulled it out of the oven and I'm gonna say it's ready it's gonna be a nice pink in medium in the middle paint look maybe a little bit on the medium-rare side so I'm gonna put this on my cutting board and I'm gonna let it rest for a minute before I slice it if you slice it right away your juice will be go at you know that your steak will go everywhere if the juice of your steak will go everywhere all right so let's finish up this sauce all right so now I'm gonna bring it back up to a simmer and we're gonna fortify it with some butter fortifying meaning just a fancy word for bring it together pretty much so we're just gonna let that simmer for about one you know two minutes all right looks like we're just about there yeah looks beautiful so I'm gonna turn to turn the heat off we're gonna go over let this relax for a minute and while this calms cools down for just a second and we're gonna go over it slice our beef all right guys with the sharp knife we're gonna just go in at an angle I'm gonna tell you just by touching this is gonna be a beautiful pink inside little probably a little bit more on the rare side on a medium rare side but tsunami a little bit more on the medium rare side I'm just gonna cut three big ones a beautiful huh we'll just turn that one around all right guys so now we're just gonna put a little bit of sauce on our on our plate it's not that nice shallot and carrot on there I'm just gonna kind of lay our fillet on top you go ahead and clean up our edges [Music] kind of put a little bit on our steak and then it is filet mignon with red wine reduction [Music] alright guys again as always thank y'all so much for watching it turned up obviously I mean just look at the picture is beautiful you really can't get any better than that

ABErZ7PAoSc.json;tonight I'm gonna make pot roast I just got home from work it's a Monday night and I figure let's have pot roast for dinner this recipe should take about an hour and 10 minutes total cook time so it's 5:30 we'll eat about seven o'clock by the time we're all done I'm I'm kind of excited because this is a different instant pop in than one I've used before I sent the folks at the company an email about my videos and they sent me duo 60 and this is a 6 quart like my other one my other instant pot is the lux and so I'm going to learn what are the little differences between these two machines the first thing I'm going to do to make this pot roast is hit the saute button what I've learned is that when you're going to brown meat before you put any oil in the pan get the pan really good and hot and then put the oil in so I'm just gonna let this pan get heat heat it up so well the the instant pot is getting hot before I put the oil in I've got about a two and a half pound boneless chuck roast and I am going to spice it with something from pennsie spices this is Quebec beef spice and I thought it I would I would try that out it has pepper and salt and sugar and coriander and garlic which sounds really good so I'm just rubbing that in here a little bit before I brown this meat okay now I think this is hot enough to pour my oil into pour about just kind of a skosh a couple of tablespoons maybe of canola oil I like to use canola oil when I'm trying to brown meat because you can get it hotter than you can olive oil so now yeah that's good and sizzling I'm gonna put this meat in here and Brown that on all sides for about three minutes per side so it's taken most of my adult life to figure out how to get a really good sear on a piece of meat and so as I said you gotta get the pot good and hot before you put the oil in and then put the oil in and then put the meat in but the other thing you got to do when they put the meat in just let it sit for at least three minutes aside and he gets that nice brown on it so every side needs to be in that oil for for about three minutes get that nice Brown and don't move it around don't check it don't flip it okay so this meat I've steered it not only on the top and the bottom but on the side I'm gonna pop this out of here I think that looks pretty nice I'm gonna put it on a clean plate and now what I'm gonna do is I've got about two cups of sweet onions and some garlic and I'm just gonna Brown this until the onions and garlic start to get soft and then I'll put that meat back in and let it cook for an hour okay so the onions have cooked the onions and garlic have cooked for about three or four minutes and I'm gonna pour in one in 3/4 cups of beef broth and about what is this this is half a cup of red wine and what I'm gonna do is let that heat up just a minute to get all that good meat pieces little the little flavorings off the bottom just to deglaze that pan a little bit okay and now put my my pot roots back in there actually I have some really pretty from my garden thyme sprigs and I'm just gonna throw them in hole and put the pot roast back into the pot yeah and without splashing too much all right now if I can figure out my new instant pot one thing I like about it the duo as opposed to the lux is that it has this cool feature on the side where you can just hook the lid right up there I think that's pretty neat so I'm going to turn the instant pot off and put the lid on it and go with pressure cook pressure level on the duo can be high or low we're gonna go with high pressure and I'm gonna set the timer for an hour okay and I have to make sure that the valve at the top is set to sealing and that everything is secure and now I am going to relax until this roast is cooked and then I'm going to put some potatoes and carrots in for just a few minutes at the end to cook those with it okay so the pot roast has just finished pressure cooking and I'm gonna hit do it this  release on that I love watching that scene come out while that was cooking I chopped up a few potatoes some green beans some carrots a little bit of Swiss chard and what I'm gonna do when this is all done Benny is put that in there and cook for about ten more minutes okay so the little valve has gone down that means that I can now open this could you look at this what I love about this instant pot is I can just prop that right up the oh my goodness that it looks like really a lovely tender roast I'm gonna put these veggies in I cut up a few new potatoes green beans and carrots and now what I'm gonna do suppose my instant pot I can remember how to do this oh yeah I know put it on ceiling and hit pressure cook on high for 10 more Lipson I want it as an hour let it down for just ten minutes and that'll be plenty of time for those vegetables to cook you could put the vegetables in at the beginning but I was just afraid they'd get really mushy so I just want to do it this way and then I think we're gonna have a really lovely dinner okay so I cooked those veggies for 10 minutes on pressure-cook and then I let them do a natural release for 10 minutes so we're gonna vent that and that'll take just a couple minutes to get all that steam out of there and then I think we're ready for dinner okay so the valve popped down it's done venting whew this looks pretty good let me have a look oh yeah those potatoes are lovely now what I'm gonna do I'm pulling this pot roast look at how that's just falling apart which is exactly what I want it okay so it smells really good and I'm gonna put my potatoes and carrots and onions and everything in there so one thing I'm gonna do there's a there's the the little string that was that was holding that pot roast together that's out of here Pyrus looks so good and it like it's kind of falling apart I'm gonna take a bite of that mmm it's really good when I have cooked pot roast in a big cast-iron Dutch oven on the stovetop for the most part it's turned out pretty dry but this is really really good and it is just falling apart so we're ready to eat and I hope you will try this I am pretty excited I love having pot roast for supper on a Monday night after work and I hope you enjoyed this video if you did like my channel and I hope you enjoy cooking with your instant pot thanks;['segundos']
AmZ9qmushd4.json;[Music] this is the easiest most delicious roasted beef tenderloin that you will ever make it's guaranteed to be flavorful super bouncy super juicy and so easy you will not believe it i'm laura vitale and on this episode of blaring in kitchen i'm going to show you how i make my roasted beef tenderloin now there are many ways that you can make a beef tenderloin in terms of flavor i like to keep mine very simple especially when it comes to making it for a holiday meal because i want the flavors to sort of complement everything else so i always just use rosemary and garlic and i do a little bit of red wine and it's delicious and i serve it with a horseradish sour cream sauce and it's just loved by all you can do different rubs on it if you want to like i said for a holiday because it is a pricey cut of me i like to keep it basic so that it goes with my roast potatoes and my broccolini and my salads just perfectly so let's get into it this is very easy you're going to love it the first thing i've done is preheat my oven to 425 i want it really hot this is a beef tenderloin um some parts of it will be a little bit fatty but it's been well trimmed i trimmed this myself but i would suggest you get you butchered to do that if you are not so familiar with cleaning a tenderloin because you really don't want to waste it you don't want to mess with it if you don't know what you're doing because it is pretty expensive right so the method does not change on based on the size of your beef tenderloin this isn't that big it's about three pounds uh which is sort of perfect for i would say six people because i mean it's my time it shrinks it'll be a little under three pounds and that's feeding six people very well so we're gonna go ahead and get started the first thing i'm gonna do so i told you i have the oven preheated the next thing i'm going to do is cut a bunch of kitchen twine because i and you we have to tie this beef tenderloin you don't want to miss or skip this part because otherwise everything would just kind of be uneven and trust me it's a necessary part of this whole shebang i also have a large skillet preheating over medium high heat and it is an ovenproof skillet because i'm going to take the skillet and throw it right into the oven once i get all these cut and i start tying my tenderloin then we can talk about thermometers that i think is really important when you're cooking ketamine like this especially an expensive kadami because you don't want to risk overcooking it so let me get all these cut and then we move forward okay so i'm going to season my board and the reason i do that is because i find it just a little bit easier to do this to season the underside of my roast that makes any sense it works just trust me i got this tip from jamie oliver years ago and watch see perfectly seasoned on the bottom beautiful and now i take a little bit of salt and we do this on the top and on the sides unseasoned meat is probably like one of the worst things on the planet so season and season it well now you're wondering hey oh you forgot to put the garlic in the rosemary well here's the thing we're going to roast this into the oven at a really high temperature what i do not want is for that rosemary and garlic to burn if i were to sear it in a really hot pan now and then throw it into the oven so what i do is i sear this as is right and then i combine garlic rosemary a little bit of salt and pepper and some olive oil and then i smear all over the whole thing before it goes into the oven and you just wait it's phenomenal okay my pan is hot and it's ready and i want to sear this on all sides take some oil um i want to sear this on all sides so i'm just going to be very patient about it i'm not going to rush the process oh let's talk thermometers okay um i know that you're not going to want to hear this from me but you need to invest in an oven safe thermometer for your meats okay this is a therm pro i have two of these because i love these so much what this does is it allows you to set the temperature of the meat that you want like the temperature that you want to cook that right so i like my meat on my tenderloin i like to pull it out of the oven in 125 and it will carry over cook a little like five to seven more degrees so i set it at 125 and then before it goes into the oven i will stick the probe in there and this sits on the counter and this sits into the oven right and when it reaches 125 it will beep and then i know my meat is perfectly cooked it doesn't have to i don't have to worry obviously if you don't have one of those and you have a regular meat thermometer you're gonna have to check it um i don't like to pull it out any earlier any later than 125 because i like mine quite pink but hey it's totally up to you you can change that number however your heart desires but it's a tenderloin so please don't take it out at medium well or well done or i will cry because that is expensive and it needs to be buttery so i'm gonna clear i'm gonna wash my hands and then we get going on chopping up with the garlic and the rosemary [Music] so i went ahead and chopped up the rosemary and the garlic and i'm gonna go ahead and add a touch of salt to it because when i do this to the garlic and the rosemary with the the salt it kind of starts to create a more of a paste um which i really like but you don't really i mean it's necessary no but i really like it the beef is looking i mean really gorgeous look at that don't forget the ends it takes literally a second but it is important look at that oh my word i mean you just know it's going to be fantastic right look at that beauty okay turning this down now because it's done its thing go ahead and turning it down it just smells so good it smells so good i also feel like when it comes to tenderloin i you know it's such a prime cut of meat and you're spending a pretty penny on it so i don't want to muck about with flavors too much because i don't want to lose the buttery flavor of the tenderloin so that's why i like to keep it like that okay so to that i'm just going to add a little bit of olive oil i'm also going to go ahead and take a pretty big size onion so i may just do half i put it around because when i add a bit of wine and a bit of water to the pan it does create really delicious flavor for a sauce it's fantastic i'm gonna go ahead just do this with my hands don't recommend use a spoon but you know me i like living on the edge and now that will be amazing as it roasts into the oven that flavor will be in the sauce that will then end up being drizzled on the sliced beef just gonna let that sit there for a second so i can wash my hands and then we're gonna add a little bit of wine and our thermometer and we throw it into the oven stick the probe in beautiful okay time has started we're going to go ahead and add a bit of wood half and a bit of red wine and now i'm going to go ahead and throw this in my really hot oven to roast until the internal temperature hits 125 a size like this it's going to take 20 minutes no longer you'll see so wish me luck a big pan but you know i don't work out for nothing you know what i'm saying i mean i'm not that buff but i try yeah get that in the thermometer will live up here as my friend tony soprano used to say boom i'm gonna clean and i'll see you soon a rhyme again i mean i'm on this on the ball okay so i roasted it until the thickest part reached 125 now i cover it with some aluminum foil when it comes out so that it does carry overcook and i carried it over to about 135. you can see i hope you can see anyway you can just tell by how bouncy it is that it's going to be pretty rare which is kind of how i like it but the the frontier will be a little bit more cooked so if that kind of freaks you out to see you know red meat then you you know cook it a little bit longer it's totally up to you i just would not cook a piece of meat this pricey like i said well done because it has no fat so it's very lean you've got very little fat running through it so it's just going to dry it out and be shoe leather and nobody wants that before you slice it make sure you get rid of your strings you don't want to eat that and now look in the pan it created a gorgeous sauce to spoon over the sliced beef i'm also going to serve it with a horseradish cream sauce which i will actually have the recipe for you in the same recipe that this would be on and this is going to be on my website i'm going to have that recipe there for you as well with this one because the two together are pretty phenomenal and i just love it so strings are almost all gone and then we get to slicing make sure that you please let your meat rest for at least 10 minutes because otherwise you're going to be washing off you're going to basically all the goodness from the inside is going to wash out so string is out let's give this a little cut so these would be a little bit more cooked and then as you get to the thicker part they will be a bit more rare which is exactly how i like it like i said this is a prime piece of meat so i don't want to cook this until it's well done or even close but to me this right here is perfection see that beautiful and that was taken out at 125 so if you take it out any you know more then as it sits it will carry over cook so you're just gonna have to be careful and i am slicing very thick slices and that's very generous but hey if you're not going to feed your people generously then what's the point at least that's my opinion right and like i said you can certainly cook this to whatever temperature you like some people will say that even this is a little bit too well done i think it's pretty perfect it tends to please everyone even those that don't like their meat really underdone so i'm gonna reserve that for me i'm gonna pour the juices in there and then what i do is i kind of mix those around like that which is what my nana would do i'm going to move this closer to me and that's my piece right there this is my piece right here which i mean really it slices like butter right delicious i already know oh my word then you take this beautiful sauce that i just literally pour it all over the place move this pan closer right that would make so much more sense it's just so phenomenal such a crowd pleaser everyone loves it the meat really shines through the rosemary and garlic will go so well with the rest of my menu nothing is going to compete i do a little bit of fresh rosemary around and some fresh parsley to really make it shine and that is a gorgeous feast that is so perfect i like to hit it with just a touch of salt because the inside of the meat you know makes really everything stand out and that is it's perfect it's simple the technique is very easy the technique works with every size of tenderloin that you have so it doesn't really matter just do it this way you cook it this way and it will be perfect every single time go to laura in the kitchen.com for the written recipe i'm staring at it like it's going to walk away from me alrightykitchen.com has a great recipe for you hope you've enjoyed spending time with me i hope that you make this for your holiday table or just any special occasion um it's butter i mean it is literally butter and this pan sauce it cooks itself recipes there i'll see you next time bye [Music];['segundos']
AQp3TvJqvVY.json;Chef Buck here and today i'm going to blacken up . a piece of fish so i'm going to take this lonely   little piece of fish and i'm going to blacken it . up easy peasy lemon squeezy when you're blackening   fish not a lot to it all you need is butter and . too much spice and a hot skillet i got a cast iron   skillet here so the first thing i'm going to do . is make sure that i'm turning on the right burner   then i'm going to put it on medium high heat and . go ahead and start getting this skillet ready   because that's that's one of the most important . things is making sure that when you're ready to   lay your fish in your skillet that your skillet . is super duper hot you know almost to the smoking   point now before i put my spice on my fish i'm . going to melt up this little piece of butter   so now i got my butter melted up now i'm going . to take my spice and this is a lot of spice   for one lonely little piece of fish but you want . to have too much spice but it doesn't have to be   overly spicy you don't have to use a lot of hot . spice you just want a lot of flavor to cook on the   outside of that fish i got a little chili powder . a little onion powder garlic powder some paprika   some salt and pepper some italian seasonings you . can use all of these spices you can use whatever   kind of mixture you like but just go heavy on . it so i'm going to throw all this in a bowl here   get my spices nice and mixed up   i'm going to take my fish coat it in my butter get . butter all around on the outsides of my fish here   this fish was actually a frozen piece of fish i . mean if you can use fresh fish that's fantastic   but if you're using frozen fish you know make sure . it's completely thawed and that you've dried it   and then you can go ahead and let it . sit out and get to room temperature   so now we got it all slicked up with butter now . i'm going to take my seasoning and really give   one side of my fish a nice heavy coating of . spice and since this is a thick piece of fish   i'm going to go ahead and coat the sides as well   now we're just waiting for the skillet to heat up . okay i think my skillet is more than hot enough   so now i'll go ahead and lay my fish in the . skillet when it hits the pan it's going to sizzle you want to make sure your fish starts to cook . right away now make sure and use up all of my   butter get this spice out of here now get my . remainder of spice and cover the uncoated side   really well and i know this seems like a lot of . spice but that's what blackened fish is now see   how smoky that is you know i really need to have . my air vent on but that would muck up my audio so   i just gotta hope that i can cook this fish before . my smoke alarm goes off and it doesn't take long   at all for fish to cook you know depending on . the thickness of the fish you know just maybe   two or three minutes each side all right so . now giving my fish a nice turn boom and look   at that nice black inside there now what's the . difference between blackened fish and burnt fish   there's no difference i'm just over here burning . fish you know it's just the spice you know you're   just burning fish with spice on it now ideally . you want to use a cast iron skillet for this   but if you don't have a cast iron skillet that's . fine you know i've blackened fish plenty of times   in just a regular non-stick pan you . just got to make sure that it's hot hot   hot hot since this fish is a little . thick and that looks perfect though i'm gonna go ahead and cook the sides a . little bit get a nice sear on my edges so there you have it a nice blackened piece . of fish with that nice charred spice on there   that charred butter and spice that's going . to be a delicious piece of blackened fish looks like i need a little spot of color on there . cherry tomatoes are perfect for a quick makeover   but you always want to use an odd number you . don't want to you don't want it to be even   you know you want to look dangerous . you want it to be unpredictable i think three tomatoes does that ready . in just a few minutes i don't know what   camera girl's eating today but . i'm pretty sure i got her beat look how nice that is life is hard without a camera . girl i'll tell you that   cg has a lot of qualities so many good ones . but about her eighth or ninth best quality   is being the camera girl you . just can't have too much spice if you want to check out the recipe i'll . be written down below you can head over to   MyFoodChannel.com check out all our recipes over . there thanks for watching and doing all that stuff   and i'll see you next weekend hopefully . camera girl be here but either which way   either i'll be eating with her i'll be eating . all on my lonesome we'll see you then bye-bye;['segundos']

baking your own bread the payoff here is so sweet that a little bit of extra work and mess is undoubtedly worth it the weekdays are for one pot meals and time savings today is all about the pure pursuit of crisp okay up front the chips part of this recipe was a real pain to figure out in the united states every recipe for chips or fries uses a russet style potato so that's where i started and after four distinct attempts where i tried absolutely every single move i knew how to make crispy potatoes the results were mixed at best it seems that right now in the united states where i'm at the russet potato just isn't gonna work for a really crisp french fry they can be a workable option in a pinch but i'd feel bad recommending them without this disclaimer but i want everybody out there to have a memorable fish and chips experience at home and there's two ways we can do that without a russet potato the first and probably most accessible option is buy high quality frozen fries in the united states and most of the world 99 of the good fries you will have ever eaten in a restaurant were frozen sorry in and out your fries are fresh and they stink so yes i am recommending frozen french fries as one option and i don't have any shame about it the second option and the one that i think has the most payoff i'm gonna show you right now for that we need three to four pounds of kennebec potatoes these kind of bags are the closest match that i've found in the u.s to the maris piper potato variety that's widely used in the uk chip shops however these might be hard to find though so i'd say start by checking with your local produce supplier or maybe the buyer at your grocery store now i'm gonna peel these up using my y peeler here and from this point we're basically just gonna replicate the exact same steps taken in the french fry or chip factory at home once these are all peeled up i'm going to grab a few quarts of cold water and then cut these into chips i'm going to cut off just the roundest parts of the sides of the potato here it's prettier that way and it makes it much easier to cut from there i'm going to size up how many three-quarters inch slabs i can get out of each potato i'm going to cut those slabs and now i'm going to cut these into the best squares that i can so they cook evenly if that means trimming off the edge of the last one to get these just right so be it i really want to replicate the stubby chunky chips that i've seen in pictures from the uk and i think these look pretty close once we've got all four pounds of these potatoes cut up we're gonna dunk them into my reserved cold water splash some water around a little bit and get as much starch off of these as i can now we're gonna drain that off replace it with fresh water splash them around again it's still cloudy so back to the sink drain it off fill it back up with fresh water splash them around one more time and now these look pretty good the water is clear and the potatoes look nice and clean so i'm going to put a lid on these and throw them in the refrigerator to soak in a restaurant this would be overnight for the sake of ease but at home it can be anywhere from two to twenty four hours i soaked mine overnight the next day i'm gonna pull these from the fridge and load a large heavy bottom pot onto my stove into that i'm gonna measure 3000 grams of water and 45 grams of white distilled vinegar i learned this vinegar move from the legend himself kenji lopez alt and according to the ketch this little bit of vinegar in the water helps strengthen the pectin on the outside of the potato and that's huge because we're going to be cooking these three times and it keeps the potatoes from totally breaking down once the water is at a boil we're going to dump in all of these chips and bring that water back to a simmer i'm going to cook these stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes and after that 10 minutes we're going to come back and break one to check for doneness it's cooked these look good now using a spider or a slotted spoon i'm going to transfer these chips to a wire rack to drain and cool off from this point on getting super crisp chips is all about dehydration the more water we remove from the outside the crisper the chip we're going to get i'm going to blot these dry a little bit for good measure with a paper towel and then we're gonna let them evaporate and cool for 15 to 20 minutes in that time i'm going to dump this vinegar water out dry the pot very well because water and oil don't get along then i'm going to load it back on top of the stovetop and grab a jug of neutral cooking oil i'm loading about four inches of canola oil into my pot but vegetable oil soy oil or beef towel will also work just fine once the oil is preheated to 285 degrees fahrenheit we're going to lower in all of the chips this low temperature fry is going to further dehydrate the exterior and that's going to allow us to finish these chips at a hotter temp for longer and that means a crispier chip after five minutes at 285 degrees we're gonna drain these well move them back to the wire rack on the sheet tray and as you can see they're already starting to look kind of like chips they're golden and the exterior is now full of gelatinized potato starch now these need to be chilled really hard to reach their full chip potential so we're going to throw them into the freezer for about 30 minutes while those chill in the freezer now it's time to talk fish for this fish and chips for that i've got roughly one to one and a quarter pounds of not frozen but fresh atlantic cot this fish has a really firm flesh and since it's fresh it's not very wet frozen cod will work but it needs to be dried very well before you use it now we're gonna break these down into smaller pieces that means a higher ratio of breading to fish which me likey and it also ensures the fish can cook quicker and more evenly but more on that in a second the cod i've got here is from the thicker loin end so we're going to cut it diagonally to get that classic tapered pub look and it's up to you on how you want to shape these you can cut these into three pieces if you want they're going to cook a little bit faster but once i've got mine broken down i'm going to season them with a light amount of salt on both sides there is going to be some salt in the batter so we're not going too crazy speaking of batter set that fish aside for about 10 minutes while we get the batter for the fish made up for that i'm going to open up a 12 ounce beer the type of beer is up to you i like stuff that comes in a green bottle that seems to work pretty well and now i'm going to grab a bowl and into that measure 75 grams of all-purpose flour 75 grams of white rice flour 2 grams of salt and 2 grams of baking powder i'm gonna whisk these dry ingredients up and now i'm going to keep whisking and stream in about 75 of this bottle of beer just to see where i'm at you may need more or less beer depending on your setup but this is the texture you want it should be slightly thinner than you think i made this mistake three times in a row before i figured out that the thick batter actually suffocates the fish and it steams in there instead of fries and the breading goes soft almost immediately for best results this beer batter needs to be very cold when we use it so i'm gonna throw it into the fridge for a few minutes while we finish prepping everything else now back to the fish salting them has drawn out a decent amount of moisture and that for sure needs to be eliminated for the ultimate crispness later on so we're going to gently blot these with portions of paper towel and just make sure to blot the tray too because that's also got some fish juice on it once we've got all these dry we're going to add one more step to make sure that we've got the crisis possible fish and to ensure that the batter sticks to these fish filets into a plastic container i'm going to measure a 50 50 blend of rice flour and all-purpose flour and that's maybe 25 grams of each we're gonna coat the cod with whatever sticks this is an insurance policy to make sure the batter does not slip off when we take a bite once these are floured up we're gonna move over to the fry pot and make sure the cold chips are also at the ready these have been in the freezer for 30 minutes now and they're pretty stiff and pretty frigid it's gonna make a sick chip in just a minute one last detail we need to hit before we fry and that's diy tartar sauce of course i don't know if tartar sauce is traditional in the uk with fish and chips but in the us in my house it's totally essential and it comes together in like five minutes so for that i'm gonna combine 175 grams of mayonnaise 100 grams of chopped bread and butter pickles 20 grams of capers 10 grams of chopped parsley 30 grams of minced and rinsed red onion 40 grams of dijon mustard the juice of a half of a small lemon and a small garlic clove that's pressed i'm gonna stir all that up to combine i'm gonna transfer that to a little container and set it aside okay now it's go time i'm gonna grab the batter from my refrigerator and check the temperature of my oil i turned the pot back on while we were flowering the fish and now we're at 375 degrees perfect now i'm gonna grab my cod filet and lower it into my batter one piece at a time i'm gonna flip it over and make sure that it's really well coated and then i'm gonna let all that excess batter drip off because more batter is definitely not more result as i spoke to earlier so now we're gonna move this over to the fry pot and i'm gonna lower it in gently i'm gonna let it fry for just a second before i let go and when i do that i'm gonna let it go away from my body that way i don't splash hot oil all over my unsocked foot i'm gonna batter the second piece and then repeat that lowering it in very gently and dropping it away from my body now with battered fish we're cooking in a way that i don't use very often and that's high heat real fast 375 degree oil is quite hot and we're keeping it hot by only frying two pieces at a time when fishes cook too slowly and for too long it goes way past the recommended 135 degrees fahrenheit and we have some serious crispness issues as fish becomes overcooked the proteins inside seize up and squeeze out all kinds of water and that goes right into the crispy batter and then we're very frustrated after four minutes of frying total we're golden and crisp and i'm gonna move this over to my wire line sheet tray and let's look at this thing that rice flour in the batter really makes a big difference in terms of brittle exterior let's cut real quick to a test batch this is the same recipe but with cornstarch instead of rice flour and in my opinion it just sits really heavy on the fish a little bit more doughy and most importantly it's just not as crisp as rice flour and also i found that cornstarch didn't stick as well to the fish so i chose rice flour as soon as these fish are out and on the wire rack we're gonna lower in our chips and fry those between 350 and 360 degrees fahrenheit for seven to eight minutes if you're using store-bought fries now would be the time to drop those and i want to mention we're gonna be frying these chips in two batches so that the temperature of the oil doesn't drop too much and i only fried two of my four pieces of fish because it's just me eating and if you're worried about this fish sitting over there and getting soggy this is what it's like after 35 minutes glassy but back to the chips as you can see these are looking very good the main problem with the russets was that they browned too quickly in this final hot oil step the sugar in them caramelized well before the outsides were dehydrated and crisp and that's just not ideal after 7-8 minutes these kennebecks are just starting to brown and they feel very firm almost like potato glass i'm going to pull them out and drain them really well with my spider and then i'm going to move them into a large bowl and season it with salt listen to these things [Music] that is a crispy boy these are creamy all the way through they're deeply deeply crunchy and they're very potatoey the fish is scented with hoppy beer and it's perfectly coated in a thin veneer of glassy crispy batter you didn't know crispness at this level was available in the home now i've got my tartar sauce at the ready i've got my malt vinegar at the ready let's eat this thing real quick before i get out of here

B5wIE4zyW5k.json;[Music] easy baked smoky barbecue ribs yes please and here's how i like to make them so to get started i will be using around a two and a half pound rack of pork ribs [Music] now what i'm doing next is removing the membrane or the silver skin from the back of the rack of ribs be sure not to skip this step you want to make sure you remove all of it and normally it comes off in one piece but this time i didn't have such luck but either way you want to remove it because it's not easy to chew on it once the ribs are baked and it'll also prevent most of your seasoning and spices from getting into your meat so after a quick rinse in cold water i'm going to pat it dry now i am going to use two tablespoons of liquid smoke and i'm going to rub it into the rack of ribs i'm going to start with the back side first now that i've rubbed that all over the backside i am now going to liberally sprinkle my dry rub and in this dry rub i used two tablespoons of paprika one tablespoon of lemon pepper one teaspoon of ground cumin one tablespoon of garlic powder one tablespoon of onion powder one tablespoon of brown sugar and around a teaspoon and a half of kosher salt i'll leave that up to you you might want to use more if you wanted a little bit more salty but i think this is a good place to start once i'm done with the backside of the ribs i'm going to flip it out onto a lined sheet of aluminum foil and repeat the process [Music] okay so now that i have seasoned my ribs i am now just going to tightly enclose it in my lined aluminum foil and by the way i lined this with parchment paper you don't have to do that but i just do that by habit and now i am going to bake it in a preheated oven at 250 degrees fahrenheit for about two and a half hours i'm going to then remove it from the foil cover it with my barbecue sauce and then raise the oven temp to 400 degrees fahrenheit and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes [Music] okay it has been two and a half hours so now what i'm going to do is basically remove the rack of ribs out of the aluminum foil place it on the baking sheet and i'm actually going to pour the juices in the pan as well and then i am going to slather it in barbecue sauce i will show you how i made my homemade barbecue sauce which is a very basic one but if you have a bottled store brand that you'd like to use use that that works just as well but i like to make mine from scratch with this recipe so here's how i did it in a bowl i'm going to add around a quarter of a cup of ketchup now as you notice i'm really not measuring this i normally eyeball this but a quarter cup is a good place to start i'm also going to add around a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard and next i will be adding around a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce then i am going to add around a tablespoon of honey and if you do not have honey add some brown sugar that works just as well now i'm just going to give it a good mix and remember that dry rub that we made earlier i had some left over so i'm going to add around two teaspoons of the dry rub into this barbecue sauce and again this barbecue sauce recipe is a very basic one when i typically put together a barbecue sauce i just follow the rule of ketchup as a base something salty something tangy and something sweet and again you can use your favorite store-bought brand or your favorite barbecue sauce recipe it works great but ultimately i'll be using around a third cup of this barbecue sauce and now what i'm going to do is just brush it all over the top and glaze the rack of ribs [Music] do [Music] so while i was saucing the ribs i was preheating my oven and now it is up to a 400 degree fahrenheit temperature and i am going to go ahead and pop them into the oven for an additional 10 to 15 minutes just to allow the sauce to really bake into the ribs it has been 15 minutes and these ribs are done they look gorgeous i allowed them to rest for around 10 to 15 minutes and now i am just going to slice into them and serve and as always the recipe and ingredients will be listed in the description box below i'll be the first to admit that i'm a sucker for a good smoked rib but even if you like them sauced or you go for just a dry rub i think this is an easier way to make it when you can't make it to the barbecue pit [Music] i hope you give this recipe a try i hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music] hey guys you can click on the video icons for more recipes or you can click on my picture icon to subscribe thanks for watching;['segundos']

and don't forget to subscribe to the channel we need a new subscriber stay tuned i'm going to show you exactly how to make this beautiful classic well let me show you how to make the real beef bourguignon uh beef bourguignon very simple friends i'm going to show you how to make this has to be the most simple stew you can possibly make okay classical uh uh certainly made by a lot of people but you've been asking me so much what is your version of beef bourguignon so i'm going to show you it's really simple you're going to love it we have a little mizan plus but before i get going i'm going to saute a little bacon and i'm going to put a little butter in there you don't really need a bottle to put but i got clarified butter right there friends and this will work though the reason why you scrub fire butter is because it doesn't bury or not uh as much as regular body you know that right of course you know that you're right you've been watching my channel for all of the new people that have never watched the channel welcome to the kunis uh cooking channel on youtube thank you for watching and thank you for subscribing we've had so many great subscribers you guys are amazing all right so first thing we're gonna do i do it in two part but i tell you what it's because i got somebody doing the dishes here at home i do everything in one pot cause i gotta do dishes here i don't gotta do dishes so look we're gonna saute some bacon i got thick bacon you really don't need um uh to put anything before you do bacon just make sure it's low heat we're gonna saute the bacon at low heat always low heat the reason why you do low heat by the way for those of you then don't know yet i got my gas stove back yes we finally got a way to get it so i'm very happy so um we're gonna um uh saute the bacon just the idea the reason why you want to do it slow friends is because um i'll talk about the mizan pasta in a minute uh is because um oh here you go turn the heat on is because um otherwise if you do it too fast you burn the lean part of the bacon before the fat that's time to melt render that is right so we want to make sure that you say and now let's turn this guy on and then what we're going to do here is we're going to uh saute the onion like i said at home do it already in one pot okay but i'll show you the order in which is best to use it i got the onion here friends and what happened is uh the onion i got them big you see they're big big big onion they're not smoked they're not uh cut small because they're gonna cook for two and a half hours so we want to make sure they're big if you mince them uh by the time you're cooking for two and a half hours they're gonna be nothing matter of fact you know what we're gonna do we're gonna put some pearl on your oso in there so we let them cook in there for a minute we're gonna caramelize them always caramelize them right so a little salt is gonna happen there and we're gonna get them turned golden brown before we do anything else the bacon the bacon we are going to caramelize him as well we're going to render all the fats and we're going to use that fat okay some people remove it okay i don't know what um where they got that idea from but bacon fat i hate to tell you but it's a beautiful box oh for those of you they don't want to use bacon because of whatever reason you don't want to use it um just don't use it that's all you know everybody's always asking me what do i replace it with do i replace with turkey bacon have you really had turkey bacon you can do it if you want with turkey bacon i just recommend you skip it okay so let's talk about the mison plus a little bit we got chuck roast chuckles is the best meat to use for this okay chakras you can use short ribs if you want it's very nice also people can have a short rib but i do it with chakras i got also i'm going to use a lot of onion on this recipe i'm going to use pearl onion you can buy them fresh you can buy them frozen or you can buy them in a jar this jar right there is ant nelly they are in water friends and you drain them really really really good and we're going to saute them very easy frozen you can use frozen as well if you want but i highly recommend this if you can get them aunt nelly i don't know where you can find them but i find them at a grocery store carrots i got some carrots in here and uh then i cut peeled and cut i got little potatoes we're gonna put the potatoes toward the end mushrooms we're gonna talk the mushroom we got fresh thyme we got chopped parsley and garlic i don't know why i got two parsley two pasta in here i only need one all right so what we're going to do we're going to take the bacon out of here in a minute how we doing with the onion the onion would have been a good if i were to turn the heat a little harder i stayed away from my gas cooking too long i can turn the button the other way leave it up to me i always make a mistake so look the bacon is good friends what we're gonna do we're gonna take this bacon and we're gonna take it out of there yeah so we don't want a bear or not now some people like a little more crispy remember this guy is going to cook friends for two hours so you don't want it to be too crispy okay you're not making breakfast where you want crispy bacon let me just reduce the heat just a little bit so the clarified butter has got a really high smoke point the pork fat's got a good smoke point so you know what we're gonna do now you know what we're going to do friends we're going to saute the beef get in here you we're going to sit there to be friends all right we're going to get it and we're going to get that maya reaction let's make sure this is nice and hot and we're going to put the beef in here now what you don't want to do friends you don't want to uh overcrowded you don't want them to touch each other no touching okay no touching we removed all the fat you don't need the fat try make sure they don't touch each other some this is a little smaller i guess when you clean the chalk roast you got to remove all the seniors what do you think i can do i can do it all in one part we won't get them too close right no touching if you can happen right and now we're going to do let me check the onion it smells amazing here friends the onions are far away from being ready before we do anything all i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna take my soaps and my pepper and i'm gonna caramelize this meat let's check the the onion make sure they're okay oh yeah you see you all know that right you gotta still take the onion first i keep repeating it and repeating and repeating and i repeat it forever until everybody gets it and the reason why i'm always saying i remember we got a lot of people that are new to our channel friends they've never been here before so i don't want them to think we are too crazy a little bit is okay yeah all right look look look look and you see and you know what we're gonna do now imagine that as good that smells right you know what we're going to do now friends we're going to deglaze that pan with the wine oh yeah baby this is going to be delicious we're going to deglaze the pans you see that color right there this is what i'm talking about right there friends oh man this is hot what a pleasure it is to cook with guys i did it my whole life that gas uh that electric stove was uh was nice i mean i don't want to take it down too much it worked it helped us at the beginning we're looking good how am i doing they're doing good because you know what's gonna happen we're getting to the next thing the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna get the mushroom my friends let me get all my ingredients i'm good yes and the mushrooms i just wanted to show you i like when i submerge them which is what i'm doing here you see okay the beef is good friends i don't want to have to worry about the beef too much so you know what i'm going to do i'm going to remove it and i'm going to move it on the other part on the other side i'm going to put it right here because it's good and now we're going to go here we're going to we're going to turn the beef off and now we're only going to concentrate in one pot okay like i said at home i use the same pot i just keep removing things oh look look look the onions are nice see the onions are looking really really good my friends we got to put the mushrooms down we got to get rid of the water in the mushrooms so let me put them in i want to show you when they bake like this you want to quarter them cut them in half cut them in half again say we want quarters when they're big when they're small you can just cut them in half and that'll be enough don't miss them when they're big big big like this one you want to cut them in six pieces and if they're too big you cut them in eight pieces you see we're going to take it we're going to put them in we're going to put a little more salt and we're going to saute them until we get rid of all the water remember water a little more salt just a little bit and that's okay because my stock i'm gonna put some stock in it later on and my stock has no salt in it remember when you make stock by the way i hope some of you have tried the to uh to make the beef stock the way i showed you how to make it from store bought to make a little test more tasty you could also add a mushroom salt if you wanted to because we have a mushroom salt that is quite delicious flavoring we're getting rid of some of the water in there and then we're going to put the carrots now the little potatoes friends they're going to cook they're raw they're going to cook at the same time you see and then we're going to add everything else in here it's going to be really delicious carrots right there look everything is looking pretty good my friend see right down there put the carrots in there saute we're looking really good cars don't need to be saute i just want to get rid of as much of the water as possible from the mushroom can you see right there it's doing it if we don't get rid of the water they're going to have a terrible texture you might as well put canned mushroom oil you don't want to do that no no no no one do that all right so a little garlic in here that's a good sign if we put garlic that means we're getting ready friends when we put the garlic that means we're getting ready to put liquid oh don't worry about that liquid right there friends i'm gonna use it all that liquid down there i'm going to use it all i'm going to deglaze it with the wine hey look at that i see a mushroom down there oh it won't come here go get in here oh yeah right there baby this is gonna be good stuff right there my friends i'm telling you this is all goodie right there i think i lose a piece of beef yeah all right so here we go now we're going to take this right here this beautiful juice right there and we're going to put some wine now big boganyo it's definitely friends yeah don't be afraid to put wine okay i serve a glass for me oh i guess i'll open up another bowl a whole bottle of wine and then we're going to put some cognac at the end oh yeah so the only thing that we haven't done yet we have not sauteing the pearl onion the bacon get in there oh yeah baby yeah this is gonna be delicious like i say you don't eat bacon don't worry you don't need to put it in you just don't eat it anyway right so you don't need to put it in make sure your pan is hot we're gonna saute those caramelized onions just to give it a nice color you can skip the caramelized onion you already got some money on there if you don't want to now my friends here's two things we're gonna do first before i'm gonna put a little broth in here but before i do that i want to reduce my wine and try to get most of the alcohol out that's much better so we're going to do a wine reduction we're going to bring the the whole dish to boil right we're going to bring it to boil we're going to let it come to boil we're going to reduce the wine while we reduce the wine after that we're going to put a little bit of stock so not to make the video too long we're gonna stop filming right now we're gonna let the wine reduce and i'll come back in about two or three minutes the caramelized the onion would have caramelized we'll add them to this we'll add it be the stock and i'll show you how to thicken it so we'll be back in about three or four minutes however long it's going to take to reduce this wine okay all right friends look look look how beautiful the caramel is a nice flavor we can turn them off the wine has reduced enough okay just do three minutes you want to get a nice reduction right we're gonna put that mono right in there and uh i didn't leave myself any wine so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna deglaze that pan with a little bit of broth this is my beef stock it's the bee stock that was telling you about let me clean up the pan really good the heat is off it's just the remaining here so it's just to clean the pan you see it's just really really clean the pan antonio's going to be very happy because i cleaned the pan see clean the pan see look look and now all this goodies friends you know how good that's going to make it yeah that's gonna be so delicious my friend look at this that frypan is brand new clean see look at this look at his five pen friends it's clean you see there's nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing left in there so now let's reduce the heat let's reduce the heat so far very simple right you notice very simple now we're going to put the potatoes you let them cook in it let them just cook them right in there those little potatoes i got little potatoes you don't have those yellow potatoes you can get whatever potatoes you can find you can cut them uh you know i have to put potatoes you can serve with the mashed potatoes i also love it with mashed potatoes okay and it's up to you really i just love to serve it with some kind of a potato so mashed potatoes let me put just a touch more stock there you go and this right there my friends is so now let's talk about thickener if you watch any of the my other videos my the beef stew and all that you already know how to do this but you see a lot of people what they use they use a bear magnet thank goodness i'm here thank you next time here where would i be in another kitchen somewhere where i'm here cooking for you i forgot fresh time you got to put fresh time fresh time if you have fresh time then use dry time that's okay it's really important okay i put the garlic in there right i hope i did oh yeah yeah sometimes i forget i put salt and pepper i'm gonna put a little bit more pepper and i put a little more salt because my stock is not doesn't have any salt remember it's a it's homemade so it doesn't have any any salt sauce all right so you can put a bell manure which is butter and flour you mix them together i don't believe in that technique okay i don't believe in a technique people especially people do it at the end it's not because the butter is mixed with the flour and if you put it at the end then it's gonna the flour flavor is gonna disappear it's gonna be starchy it's gonna taste like glue flour needs to cook so you're gonna put flour you gotta put it at the beginning or you gotta put it at the end but it's gonna be a cooked roux we'll talk about that another time all we gotta do now we're gonna put flour in there now how do we do it diluted in water no we don't do that so for those of you that have been following my channel you know where i'm going with this i'm going to put my strainer and if for those of you that have never seen this this is a cool technique i promise you you're going to love it i got to get a whisk and then i'll show you all right i'll show you it's very simple we put a a strainer in there and then we put flour okay and then what's gonna happen is the flour is gonna cook for the next uh two hours two two and a half hours however long it's gonna take for it and i promise you the flour you have completely completely disappeared what you do you just mix it up in here like this you see your probably if you've seen the channel you've seen me do this before and it's a really cool technique if you've never used it before i highly recommend you try it you know i've been doing this my whole life friends and i tell you what i've used every thickening technique you can think of okay and a cornstarch arrowroot [Music] and this is an easy thing for you guys to do at home but also be the new to the kitchen if i say oh let's now use a roux you're going to say well i don't make a rule of course you don't make a rule most people at home don't make a roof all right we got to be realistic this is not a channel and it's about me showing what i can do it's about me getting you in the kitchen to do these things and and do it and be successful at it because it's not that difficult to do so let's look at it let's see how thick it is see it's a little um it's still a little liquid i i we're going to put just a little bit more be careful now if you're going to add more you can add more uh toward the cooking at least you got to give the flour at least 15 20 minutes to cook so up to 15 20 minutes until you're finished you can add a little bit more flour okay but don't do it at the last minute because that flour i don't care if you add butter to it it's still not gonna cook okay and and the starchiness of the flour is not something and i enjoy it okay so look everybody can do this everybody can do this this is not complicated to do you see and it works wonderful my friends all right oh mama i think we're done you come back over here all right now look so now you can cook this in the oven friends you can cook it in the oven and it will cook beautiful in the oven it's going to take about two and a half hours at three and a quarter approximately you'll check it to see one of them the meat has to be like fork friendly okay and and that's all we need my friends right there we're gonna put a little bit of parsley now and then we'll put a little bit more parsley to the end all right we'll get better now this is this one for flavor and the one we put to the end is it's for the for the look of it because it looks nice and fresh okay so like i say in the oven on the stove if you leave it on the stove let me tell you it smells amazing if you put it on the stove you can cover it because you're going to cook it very slowly remember this is like very low heat look i'll show you the heat i gotta know you see very low heat as low as you can get if your burner is too big then put it in another burner you want it to cook little little not like you know if you boil it too much you you'll reduce it you're like it'll attach in the bottom if you do it gently you know every so often just go by and he'll go mix it up a little bit you know check it out make sure it's good that's all all you got to do put the cover back on you don't have to worry about it or pop it in the oven and do the same thing after half hour 45 minutes check it to make sure it's good in the bottom and cook it two two and a half hours depends on the meat you get it's going to take a little bit longer it could take three hours depends what it is you're using but you gotta plan two hours it's not like you gotta work for two hours you just gotta turn it on and go do something and then check it up once in a while all right so in two hours we're gonna come back and we're gonna check and we're gonna see how good it is all right i'll be back in two hours don't go anywhere all right my friends well about two and a half hours went by and um and we are done it's finished i'm gonna put a little bit of cognac whenever whenever you put cognac in something folks so or any kind of booze really uh you don't have to put the cognac especially for those of you that don't drink don't worry don't need to replace it you know some people say what do i replace it with you can't replace it with anything so um don't be afraid to put some and and the reason why i put at the end is that because um i want to test it otherwise i'm not going to put it in it makes no sense if i'm not going to test it if you put it at the beginning you won't test it it's in there so the meat should kind of fall apart and um and the potatoes are cooked and uh and the carrots are cooked and everything is cooked and and it's down i mean this is ah my mummy i made a mess so that's okay i'm gonna clean it up and uh voila i mean really it's really simple friends uh so you decorate your plates you put a little potatoes in there you you organize it the best you can so it looks pretty right and uh and and look at the mess don't make a mess like me whatever you do and put some onion in there right so you decorate the plate so it makes it look kind of pretty let me get a spatula here so i can clean up my mess because i hate that mess right there like that right and then um so so the beauty about friends the beauty about um uh putting the potatoes in there you don't need to be making mashed potatoes you don't need to be making a polenta which would be delicious right and uh so remember we're gonna decorate it with a little bit of fresh thyme because that's what we got in there we got fresh thyme in there so don't be putting fresh thyme on top of the dish it doesn't have fresh thyme in the dish right and then we will put up a parsley in there and we have a self a beautiful plate then uh that i promise you my friends it's gonna be delicious and like i said the potatoes the carrots are gonna fall apart and the beef is gonna fall apart and let me not take too big of a piece so oh short thunder it melts in your mouth it's beautiful my friend i love my job don't i have a great job i love to cook i love to eat as you can see and i get to do this for a living you

B712PVN9Sjc.json;well hello there friends fantastic recipe today i'm making a film menu with a fig and marsala sauce delicious i'm gonna show you exactly how to make it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel then ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it together right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] well hello there friends let me show you how easy it is to prepare this wonderful beer this is like a um no reverse here technique this is just a hey i just got it out of the store today you could have a filet mignon or you could have a new york sweep or uh whatever steaks makes you happy my friend okay this is uh two filet mignon that i got at the store and all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna season them pepper them pop them in a pan and pop them in the oven really really simple nothing special now if you have the time friends you can put the salt on it as much as the day ahead put it on a rack and let it um and uh and and soak it with salt i mean soak it season it we sold overnight if you have the time great if you don't have the time then don't worry about it every so often we don't have the time and if we want to do a reverse here we released a video uh the week of valentine chateaubriand tells you exactly how to do it or the prime rib review also tells you exactly how to do it okay so you're more than welcome to watch those we're putting a little clarified butter in the pan so it won't burn if i put regular butter the milk protein will burn in there and uh and obviously that's not what we want so we want to make sure the clarified batter is hot and we're looking for 365 degrees and i got it right there friends so i'm going to go and just give it a nice ear we're going to give it a nice seal on both sides and then i'm going to pop it in the oven okay this is going to have the little gray line on the outside the only way to avoid that is to do the reversing okay so now we're going to make a sauce to go with this friends very simple sauce i'm gonna use some butter that's my favorite part of my job oh hey you come back over here and i'm using my reduction saucepan which really really makes a really oh mama me i haven't drink anything i promise you and um so i got let's lower the heat i'm going to put a little shallots in there and i'm going to make a a very simple sauce my friends and we're saving a little shower because i'm going to put some uh asparagus i'm going to make a uh a really simple uh fig a dry fig you want to use dry pig for this because wet fig will bring him too much water if you get them at the grocery store chop little figs let's see how we're doing here let's do you know look it's not releasing itself so wait just give it a second don't touch it for a few minutes eh um fig and you know i love tarragon you don't have targon you can use thyme you can use rosemary you can use sage use whatever makes you happy right and then we're gonna put some masala wine in there believe it or not friends look okay now releasing yeah mean it's not ready if it's not releasing yet then it's not ready to go all right a little fig shallots you can put garlic if you want but it's too elegant for the sauce i'm gonna see it releases perfectly and we're going to wait just a little small second we're going to put on the other side we're going to give it a quick little seal to get a nice color in there now if you don't have clarified butterflies use a good cooking oil it looks like an avocado oil a high temperature oil vegetable oil use whatever oil makes you happy okay i don't want to be too uh controversial look at it see nice very simple we're gonna do we're gonna turn it around in the meantime you know it's a fig so i'm going to use my fake vinegar you don't have a fake vinegar then don't worry about it don't put it in you don't have it you don't have it if you have if you if you never tried it you should try a 18 year old fig vinegar frank it's amazing okay this one is 18 years old it's already reduced it doesn't have much acidity so i don't need to have to let it reduce so put a little wine in there and i'm using a masala wine you can use a madeira one you can use a port wine you know those are my favorite wine to use all right and then we're going to see how we're doing over there yes now we're going to roll it around give it a nice sear all the way around it now there's no way friends you can cook this in a pan the whole time it's too thick you see you want to cook it in the pan the whole time you have to cook it in medaille so it'll be about half the size of this and that cooks really really really fast if you want to do that there's nothing wrong with that either you know it's a quick uh medallion of filet mignon sauteed it goes really fast okay this is very simple right all right we're not gonna take it and we're gonna pop it in a preheated oven at 425 degrees my friend right there go in the oven goodbye let's not worry about it you know what i'm gonna do friends i am going to move my asparagus right here so i'm going to do the asparagus right here and asparagus all i did friends is uh let me put some butter every time i use butter i love it i love my job period i have a fun job i love to cook i'm retired and now i'm cooking for you guys it's really cool okay so look guys masala wine does not need to be reduced so we're not going to reduce it very much all right we're going to put a little bit of broth for those of you that have been following my recipes my channel you have made a beef broth i know you have made some kind of a beef broth i'm going to be stuck if not friends there's video on our channel i want you to see them 40 asparagus we saute a little bit of shallots and we're going to put our sun dried tomato if you got them you don't have them don't worry about it okay remember this is cooking not rocket science so we're not trying to impress anybody we just want to cook a quick little steak dinner all right so look the asparagus my friends what do you do with asparagus you must rehydrate them in water cook them in water first and then we put them you do that with all the vegetables friends all the vegetables to make sure everything is okay yeah um all the vegetables friends okay uh they they do you poach them in boiling water then you put them in ice water you do that with green beans matter of fact there's a video on how to do the green beans on the website right over there it should be a link and you go and check it out okay you do the same thing with the green beans you do the same thing with asparagus you see i cut them and i cook them really really simple right a little salt and pepper in there let's put some crushed black pepper we like it it looks good right a little salt right and then we're going to saute the asparagus in butter i mean look at this a child could do this now how do we cook the asparagus you know i showed you that in a few videos but if you have never seen it before a lot of people tell you to break the asparagus please don't do that we're going to break it here here here here where don't break it you don't need to break it cut it in a bias because you know it's dry as a bone right here you need to rehydrate it so it's nice when you cook it right you can't just cook it like this you see people putting raw asparagus on the grill don't do that look first you want to peel it how do you peel asparagus hello you take a vegetable peeler you see it's very fancy here you don't need to peel the top the reason why we don't eat the bottom usually friends is because it's too much fiber and we don't like the fibers right so what we do we take it and we cut it in a bias you see look right there and let me tell you something then you poach him start with this for a few minutes before and then you go you put this if you put them at the same time this is going to be overcooked by the way this is a nice and fresh asparagus you see when the buds are really close like that nice and fresh they get old they get all wrinkly and it opens no good all right so we finished cooking that letter friends we're going to finish the um the filet we're going to let it cook a few minutes and then we'll come back we'll plate it very simple the sauce we're going to finish it together we're going to let it cook a little bit get the shallots to get some flavor of it maybe 10 minutes 5 minutes we're going to take the filet we're going to let them rest and we're gonna make a nice presentation i'll be back in a few minutes okay okay friends it's been about almost 10 minutes and we'll take it out of the oven take it out it's hot it's supposed to be hot that's good we like it when it's hot so what i'm gonna do friends i'm gonna take them out they're beautiful see look at that gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so they're not really big you know six and a half ounces eight ounces you know this is uh yeah it's this one is about seven ounces actually they are seven ounces so the clarified butter you have in here friends it's kind of burn at this point you know and i don't really like it but what i like is the font in there that i'm going to use for the sauce you see all of this all of that goodies right there friends i'm going to use all that goodies right there because we all know this is like liquid gold print okay so even if it's a quick unit this is liquid gold okay and we want it we want it we do want a period period page so we're going to take it we're going to deglaze this pan it's going to be a lot better to wash too we got all that stuff and right there now remember if you're using a red wine you gotta let it reduce but a masala wine or a pork wine or a madeira wine you don't need to let it reduce okay so now what do we got well we got a sauce that is looking pretty good and the sauce is looking very good already but it's too thin so you can let her get it reduced to the right consistency but if you let her reduce you lose half of it right so since it is good already since it is good already all right let's check it and see [Music] delicious panini salt and pepper so here we go all right salt and pepper so like i said yeah if you let it reduce now friends yeah it'll reduce but your reduce you'll have nothing less so what i like to do is i like to bring up the consistency with a little bit of cornstarch that's all just a little bit of cornstarch voila very simple and you put just a little bit of cornstarch be careful a little bit of cornstarch my friend you see don't be using a lot now sometime we have tendency of using too much just a little bit goes a long way changes the consistency okay now all the flavor is there oh by the way i i had a dinner party last night and i made some extra potato i saved them those potato right there the foam dump potato i got right here there's a video on that i made a video i already released it somewhere in there okay then a portabella mushroom i love to serve portobello mushroom with a dinner like this and i show you how to prepare the portobello mushroom in a portobello mushroom video that i released a year ago over there you got to check it out friends it's really good and you can serve it with it you don't have to serve it with a portabella bathroom just everybody's whatever you want right but it's really cool okay i have them i want to show you how to do it you should try it this is going to make a really beautiful plate uh where was i going oh i know what i was going i was going to go i wanna strain this i wanna strain this i wanna strain now you know you're gonna say oh mama mia look at how many pot this guy's dirtying he's dirtying too many pots here we go well we got plenty of pots so those are not just garnish okay i use them and i'm going to strain the sauce so it's much more beautiful okay now you know there's a lot of sauce recipes on my channel and this basic technique because it's easy when this is the basic technique okay this basic technique technique right there is uh is a is a classic technique okay it's the way you use it because there's no other way around you want to extract the flavors let me tell you something the fig and all that this is going to be amazing okay look look look at this okay here we go let's put it here i have a mess so how do we serve this first let's look at the sauce let's look at the sauce you see let's look at the sauce look at this folks what it's missing it's a little thin right it's a little thin little thin let's see oh oh my god oh i'm telling you this is the sauce for the god yeah i'm telling you it's amazing we're gonna put a little butter also at the end okay we're gonna wait so the portobello mushroom how do we serve this place let me get a plate here we go i got a plate how do we serve these friends how do we serve this first we're going to let it rest a little bit more so i don't do i don't use any of the juice actually it's the butter that i got in there because i didn't have any juices i didn't cut it on there you see there's a little bit of the butter in here let me dry it up a little bit because i don't want that butter to be in our on our plate you see all right so we got it right there and uh yeah because it's not been cut into it yes so all right potable mushroom you can do the portobello mushroom plain you can put it in the bottom of the plate or i'll show you a little trick okay then we used to do in a restaurant you measure your filament y'all may get a towel to reduce this really quick i don't want to make the video too long but it's pretty cool right so you measure your filament and you figure with a cookie cutter what do you got here that's about the right size that's the better size right so you go like this right that's if you really want to make it fancy okay you certainly don't have to do this but if you want to make it fancy you're taking your your portabella mushroom and you make it the size of your filet mignon you see yeah you i didn't cut it mama there you go come over here yeah i'll show you how to see look look you go like this you take it you fill the menu right there like this you see what i'm talking about now now we thought now we're talking right all right so there's oh the potatoes i got them so we're going to put a potato in there yeah we're going to put it in asparagus now you can skip all this it's just extra stuff that i give you friends because it makes it a complete dinner okay but you certainly can skip a couple of those things right put whatever you want on here on that plate right there it's beautiful right just like this and then let's butter the sauce let's butter the sauce friends that's the best part oh yeah butter the sauce right there don't turn the heat off remember the minute you butter the sauce you want to turn the heat off so then the sauce uh the butter does not separate friends i think we're going to go with two potatoes i got them right there two potatoes and then we're going to put the sauce now you can put the sauce right on top of it or you can leave the sauce on the side it's really up to you my friends it's really really up to you you see put it on the top and i put it on the top it's it's a gorgeous look at this look at these friends look how beautiful that is is that a picture on its own right there friends put as much of the sauce rub some on your body let me tell you just wait until it's not so hot okay look i made i put it the the tower going there right the targo was i keep it in water so it stays nice right put a little sprinkle and look at this my friend bon appetit bon appetit my friends right there let's cut into the meat let's see let's see how it looks like it i got to get a knife here we go jean-pierre get a knife right there right there let's look at it beautiful medium rare it's actually medium medium rare but it's still perfect you see it's still beautiful right there gorgeous and there's a little bit of a gray mark on it but not too much not

BFrkRFgHLVk.json;[Music] hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with lasagna that's right i'm finally making lasagna it's been requested so many times and because it's such a popular italian-american holiday tradition i thought this would be the perfect time to do it so for me there are two keys to a great lasagna a fantastic meat sauce and a great cheese filling so first things first so for the meat sauce i'm gonna take some italian sausage and ground beef we're gonna put that over medium heat and while it's browning we're going to break it up into as small a pieces as possible while that's browning i'm going to take some mushrooms and give them a really rough chop okay don't worry about them all being the same size those are going to break down in the sauce anyway so i'm going to add those to my brownie meat all right go ahead and stir those in i'm also gonna add some salt some black pepper and some red chili flakes okay so at this point i want you to turn the heat to medium high and cook it until the meat's browned and any liquid that came out of the mushrooms has evaporated so you see this the meets brown in the bottom of the pan is pretty much dry and at that point we're going to add our prepared marinara sauce am i using homemade well i'm not at liberty to say but you can use just about anything here homemade jarred sauce as long as it's good quality not a problem right you saw me had a splash of water there if you're using jarred sauce make sure you rinse the jars with water and then we're going to bring that to a simmer turn it down to low and simmer for hours how long exactly i don't know it should simmer until the meat is extremely extremely tender alright i did mine about two hours you want to make sure you add a little more water along the way if it's getting too thick and once it's done and you're happy with the texture turn it off taste for salt and pepper and set it aside alright so that's half the battle our beautiful meat sauce is ready on to the cheese filling which is simply a couple beaten eggs some ricotta cheese and not that skim milk stuff the real whole milk variety for this recipe you just need the highest quality cheeses possible will people know i don't care i will know and you will know so after that we're going to add our reggiano parmesan and fresh mozzarella now you notice how it's diced and not grated you shouldn't be able to grate good soft fresh mozzarella in fact there's no saying if you can use a grater you should be a hater all right so use that nice fresh soft mozzarella they have it in stores now use it we're also going to add some salt and pepper and cayenne and then last but not least some fresh italian parsley and give that a good mix so like i said earlier if you have a great meat sauce and a really great cheese filling you are going to have a fantastic lasagna there's no way not to so before we can assemble this of course we have to boil one box one pound lasagna noodles all right make sure you're using salted water now this is the only time ever except for maybe pasta salad where i'm going to tell you when the pasta is cooked drain it rinse it and keep it in cold water alright so you see that here my noodles are ready and it's time for final assembly and yes in case you're wondering i have tried using the raw noodles not boiling them first i don't like that method all right let's talk about the pan this is not something that goes in your wimpy little 9x13 casserole dish this needs a lasagna pan 10 by 15 by like three inches deep is perfect all right so get yourself a nice lasagna pan now assembly is super easy if you can do some simple math divide your sauce into four parts your noodles into three parts and your cheese into two parts so one fourth of the sauce goes down on top of that one third of the noodles all right i had 18 noodles so i use six okay so once the first third of the noodles are down the base of our lasagna is done and we're ready for the first half of the cheese mixture right so divide that perfectly in half spread that cheese mixture out onto the noodles and then top with another portion of the meat sauce all right so once that's spread nice and even we are going to take the second third of our noodles place those over and as long as it's covered you're good don't worry about what it looks like don't worry if you got a couple broken ones it's all good when it bakes so the second layer of noodles are down the last of the cheese mixture gets spread on there i don't know about you but i'm getting kind of excited on top of the cheese just like our last layer goes the meat sauce at this point we're going to give it a little shake to settle it and yes the old tapatapa and to finish this beauty off the last of the noodles go over the top you can see the end there i just pieced together some of the smaller broken pieces doesn't matter relax once this cooks it all looks fantastic all right over that goes the last fourth of the meat sauce spread that over make sure all the noodles are covered i'm gonna dot that with more fresh mozzarella we're gonna finish with some more grated parmesan cheese cover it loosely with foil i don't want the foil touching the cheese but i do want it covered i'm going to put it on a sheet pan in case i have any spillover i'm going to put that in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes at that point take off the foil continue cooking for about another 30 35 minutes until it's done and when it's done it will be golden brown it will be bubbling and it will be hot all the way through what a gorgeous gorgeous lasagna if i do say so myself and i know you can't wait to tear into this but let it sit for at least 20 minutes it's just gonna be too hot to enjoy unless you do all right but after that all bets are off cut it into nice squares you'll get like 12 decent portions out of this or like nine huge ones you can see all those beautiful layers that super meaty sauce with the sausage and the beef and the mushrooms adding a little bit of extra something the beautiful cheeses so so delicious so whether you're serving this for your italian american christmas dinner or

all the way through remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that Bell stay tuned friends we're making it right now together [Applause] okay friends the moment I've been waiting for this is a beautiful primary right there frames this is actually a rib roast prime rib would be if this was Prime this is not prime I couldn't find the prime I found Choice it's beautiful choice though when you get it my friends this is a three bone you see one two three bone that's gonna be for about six people a six person or six people six of them yeah uh if I ever come over you better get a bigger one only kidding um uh so we're gonna do that and last year I made it just like that friends with a fat in it and everything I just did it like this and I took the bone after I cooked it this year a lot of people have asked can you please do one boneless and and without the fat on it and everything so I'm gonna do a beautiful rib roast without no ribs very simple to do friends we're going to take the bones out really simple I'm going to show you how to do it um and then we're gonna clean it up and then we're gonna make that beautiful uh um a crust that I'm gonna do on it okay so as you can see there's a bone right there oh oh one more thing I gotta tell you when you buy it friends you want to make sure you buy it from the Chuck hand because you can get that beautiful Spinelli muscle right here you see this this look at that look at that look at this look butter this is if you notice this has been out of my soul right there and if you notice on the other side friends it's very small you see as as it gets uh toward the other side of it uh we don't we don't get hardly any of that and we know we love this so much and that we want to make sure we get it so it's from the Chuck end you'd ask for the Chuck end okay all right so now we're going to remove the bone friends it's very simple to remove the bone okay no no you butcher can do it for you okay you need a a boning knife it helps with a boning knife we're gonna cut in a little bit and then we're going to separate it the secret my friends is to make sure then we keep a knife on the bone and your finger out of the way out of the way and we're gonna see at the beginning it's a little difficult you grabbing oh my goodness make sure your knife is on the bone friends the whole time you're cutting on the bone you see like my knife is on the bone and I'm scraping the bone and you can see I'm going to show you in a minute okay I'm I'm gonna got a position first and then I'll take the camera and I'll put it right in there you see look my knife friends is on the bone so you may also need a bigger knife if you want a scraping and you scrape the bone you see look and you're pushing it down it'll help you keep the knife on a bone see let's get down let's take it down all the way down to the end all the way down to the end and when they get to the end you can flip it on the other side and you can release it that way also makes it very simple you see voila now this is this is a a Ribs Right Here friends this is a ridge right there we can save them we're going to use it okay we're going to clean a little bit more you know I don't I don't really like all that fat right there but some people love it so you can do whatever you want it's really up to you it always is up to you friends it's your ribs it's your roasts this is very expensive Mama me I'll take a second mortgage on house this is so expensive but we don't do it all the time right we do it once in a while only so now in the front right there you got a huge fat cap right there and you can help yourself with your fingers Friends by the way the knife I'm using is the boning knife how much you're removing this part is really up to you okay how much you remove it's really up to you we're not going to throw all this stuff away friends we're going to save it but if we want to make a beautiful roast we gotta get rid of it see and we're going to cut it straight like I said I'm not throwing this away friends this will make a beautiful stock this will be one wonderful we are trying to create a uh a a a a a fat free kind of fat-free like I said for those of you that like The Fat Friends don't be afraid to use the other video than we did it's beautiful we're going to cook with the same principle we're going to do the reverse Sears that's really the perfect way to do it how much fat you remove it's up to you my friends I like to be nice and clean because I'm going to give it a different crust it's um it's very elegant and it's easy for you all you got to do friends is current that's all you got to do you see look spend a little more time if you really want it to be cleaned it's very simple you see a child could do this cut it there you go let's not remove too much now the least possible amount but if I don't remove it friends you know what's going to happen my quest that I'm going to put on it is going to be removed anyway because it's going to melt and my crush is going to remove you see so I want to I want to get rid of this to see all right friends I'm going to take a few more minutes to clean it I don't want to make the video longer than it has to be clean a little bit more in the back we're not going to put a crust in the back so I'm not too concerned about cleaning the back but a little bit is okay and then we're going to come back here we're going to finish to put the crust on it all right we can leave the fire right there this is going to be a top and this is going to be gorgeous all right I'm going to finish it up clean it up a little bit more and then we'll put the crust and we'll put in the oven but before we do that now we're going to take it and we're going to put the salt on it I'm gonna put the salt on it friends on all the way around it you got to leave it in there for a few hours my friend okay four or five hours if you have time Do It um do it overnight my friends do it overnight if you have the time okay we're gonna remember just a little bit more and voila we put it on a rack don't be afraid it looks like a lot of salt don't worry about it it's not all this is gonna penetrate it's gonna make the crust nice beautiful dry we're gonna put it on the rack right here friends and this rock right there it's right right there it's going to allows the air to circulate it's going to allow the salt to penetrate in an hour and a half from now just turn on the other side like this and then we're going to finish it up with a crust that's all there is still it's pretty simple right be back in a few minutes all right friends while the roast beef is resting with the salt on it we are now going to make the break on them we're going to put in I'm going to put the pecorino Romano just a little bit of pecorino Romano a little bit of Parmesan oregano may we buy him good cheese now everybody good cheese you make good stuff um and then I got a little trick here friends I like to put a little bit of cornstarch on the cheese it avoided from sticking to get to it to itself otherwise it gets all Gummy okay so we're gonna brush this a little bit I always do the cheese first it's easier right and then we're gonna put a little more let's do a little more see the cheese got a good Head Start very important right and then we're going to put a little bit of sun-dried tomatoes those are a wet sun-dried tomato I mean they're not in oil but they're moist when I want to buy them want to put a little bit of parsley chapassi you know I like to use the curly parsley sometimes sometimes I use the Italian pasta it depends we're going to put a little bit of salt not too much because the cheese is going to be salty already right I'm gonna put a little bit of garlic little chopped garlic put as much or as little as you want well that's really a matter of opinion here then we're going to put a little bit of a whole squadish a little bit of hot it's going to make a nice and wet it's going to give us the horseradish that is going to go great with the horseradish sauce this is a preparedish I love it it's very simple to use we're getting fresh horseradish these days not easy friends not easy at all it used to be the every grocery store no I can't find it so you got to use the prepare one I know some of you out there growing you're lucky good for your nostrils okay here we go we're gonna put a little boy come in here now because this is wet I just take a country bread sometime I remove the crust when I make it with fish but with this I don't need to and we're gonna mix all this up friends and you see I got the uh the cheese and all that stuff prepared in advance because otherwise it doesn't it doesn't work that way so this is the best way to do it hello and turn it on and we're gonna have a nice moist breadcrumb friends and we're gonna put on top for the roast you see you've been using them fish this is delicious I use them on salmon someone similar not exactly the same but you see look look it's nice and weight wet wet fancy we want to keep it that way a little bit more and we're done we're gonna put in a bowl and we're done friends we are now going to put this in a bowl and when we're ready to cook it we're going to put the Dijon mustard first and then we're gonna put this on top of the rolls all right so we're gonna wait a little more for the roast to be ready okay friends it's best if you wait at least three four hours my friends if you have the time it's even better if you do it the night before all right so remember this is uh see it changes color after the salt as I had an opportunity to uh get away some of the moisture in there it's really nice so now friends we're gonna put some black peppercorn on it because you haven't put any Peppers so far and then we're gonna season it with a mustard and we're gonna put a crust on top and uh and then we're gonna bake it and we're going to do a reverse here which means actually we're going to uh We're Not Gonna sear it we're going to cook at a very low temperature until it gets to what we want we're not going to sear this drink it's gonna have a nice beautiful crust and uh so here we go we're looking good so now I got the breadcrumb that we did earlier I got some Dijon mustard I'm gonna put Dijon mustard in there friends and we're going to rub a a gentle layer you know we don't have to be too thick in it because you put two you put too much it's going to be too much some philosopher than I am today you put too much you can have too much yeah that would be it what I meant to say and I don't explain it good if you put too much it's gonna run and then it's gonna take whatever it it has with it you see what I mean I never you know what I gotta move over there it never that's what I meant to say I meant to say then it doesn't stay on because it's too much I tell you my friends it's a good thing you're patient with me because I love doing this it's sexy see I like it okay enough now we're gonna put the break on let me put this over here I'm gonna wash my hand and because and then I'm going to take a spoon to put it on so that I don't uh or I got the spoon over there you see I'm glad I didn't go directly into the jar or mustard this is the background I want to show you friends the breadcrumb it sticks to itself you see look it's because of all the wet stuff we put in there smells amazing we're gonna put it on there this is a very simple roast to do friends it's very simple it's kind of like the same crust I use it for a rack of lamb and then we really gotta packet in Friends we gotta pack it in pack it in pack it in you know what I forgot guys is a a canola oil I want to put a little canola oil you spray on it I got one over there if you'll be so guys to get me one I always forget something you know canola oil is spray will be kind of nice in there just a little bit we don't need a lot we don't need a lot you see just a little bit or any kind of the olive oil spray or something we want to get a little bit of oil in there a little spray would be kind of great to have in there friends you see I forgot to put it in oh here it is beautiful that's perfect just wait so look friends yes yes yes yes right over there thank you very much see so now look guys pack it in pack it in pack it in pack it in pack it in you see the way I'm doing it you really got to be like packing it in seeing now we don't need to sold it because it's already in there really friends be very very packed in be very packaging yep we're getting there friends look at this it's already beautiful so a little bit of canola oil spray very little very little very little I'm talking about like see just a little bit that's going to hold it together nice voila boom that's it now I gotta I'm gonna put it on the Rock friends because uh I I saved the bones and then we can give that to somebody else then wants to eat it and we'll put it right in there you see now make sure it's nice back then then friends you're gonna lose a little bit of calm don't worry it's not a problem okay we're gonna get rid of the one on the side we don't need it right there and pack it in okay okay one more thing friends let me wash my hands one more time I gotta show you the important thing friends which is where to put your thermometer remember we're going to cook it at a very low temperature we're going to cook it at um uh 240 to 150 degrees until we get to an internal temperature of a 120 degrees and then we're going to take it out we're gonna let it rest as long as 45 minutes not a problem and then when we're ready to eat we're going to go back in the oven at 5 5 50 and give it a beautiful crust on the outside that's a beautiful way that's an easy way to cook the prime rib you see right so now we're going to put it in the middle gonna put it in the middle let me see let me make sure I don't know if you guys can see but I gotta go in the middle I'm trying to get you guys so you can see it I go right in the middle and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna stop right there so I'm gonna be about right here so basically I'm gonna put it in about that much you see so I go in right in the middle right there and I put it in about that much that's it that's all I got to do I can leave it like that in a pan it'll be perfectly fine and this guy right there I'm gonna put it in the oven and I'm gonna plug it in my oven is 250. so let me just go and put it in the oven okay hold on hold on don't go anywhere the oven was a little harder than I want I want it at 250 250. what have I got oh it's a little higher so 250 is what I want and now I'm going to put my thermometer in there and I'm gonna tell it let me know thermometer when it's 118 degrees so at 118 degrees it's going to give me a warning BBB I'm going to take it out and then we'll come back and I'll show you what I'm going to do okay so let's do it so you could take a good two you know I did the one on the bone it took almost three hours this one right there is probably gonna take a good two two and a quarter hours we're gonna find out I'll tell you exactly how long it took okay okay friends it's almost three hours so I'm gonna take it out I got about uh oh 118 degrees friends so I'm gonna take it out let me unplug this thing and uh and we're gonna put it back here friends and we're gonna yeah Mommy so we're gonna let her rest friends you see and that and the beauty is oh I didn't tell you but I put an aluminum pepper in there because sometimes um even if it's a low temperature friends it's uh the aluminum paper gets out of the aluminum paper the the rust gets just a little too Brown because remember now we're going to let it rest because you know you always have to let a piece of meat rest before you cut it otherwise you lose all the juices right who we want to make sure the Jews have an opportunity to redistribute that so we want to let a rest and the cool part about this recipe friends is you're gonna be able to let her rest and and then when you're ready to eat you can let it rest at half hour 45 minutes you're gonna see what it's going to get cold it's going to get a lot colder yes indeed but it's okay because this is not completely finished what we're going to do when we're ready to eat we're gonna pop it in a 500 degree oven matter of fact that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my oven right now I'm gonna put it as high as it gets and then I leave it in there 10 15 minutes it's going to get beautiful and then we're ready to eat and at that point we don't need to uh let it rest anymore because it already rested okay this is just to finish it up so I'm gonna let the rest right here about a half hour and then we're gonna pop it in the oven and then a few minutes to get a beautiful kind of BUN and then we're gonna slice it all right we'll be back in a few minutes okay friends been 30 minutes you can leave it up to 45 minutes you know but 30 minutes is enough my oven is 500 degrees now we're going just a few minutes okay friends and voila let's go and it's only going to take a few minutes 10-15 minutes 500 Degrees and we're gonna get a nice Golden Crust and we'll be ready to slice it we don't have to wait anymore okay friends we're gonna take it out of the oven it should be beautiful golden brown whoo there you go it's gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so now at this point friends uh remember it's on the bone uh and we want to take it out of the bone and uh so we probably can take a one of those guys and you know I had two of them before and somehow I lost one but I got it I got another one and uh we're gonna take it out of there let's take out the whole thing and we'll take it out of the uh we'll take it out of the um the bone what's what's on the cutting board so now at this point friends we don't need to let it rest anymore because it already rested so it's ready for us just to go so we're going to take it out I'm a bit of bones are just they're not even uh they're just attached to it and this is a beautiful yeah you can slice it like that and give your guest or you can take them and finish them up quick in a fry pan and give it a little Maya reaction if you wanted to do this but that would be really cool also so now friends all we got to do that's the beautiful thing about not having to worry about the bone not having to worry nothing I'm not having to worry nothing all we got to do announce the friend is cut it and cut herself a beautiful slice and it's really that simple there's no bone there's no nothing in the mouth the smell of the whole Squad racing sun-dried tomato cost in there my friends is amazing so how big a small of a slice you cut it depends how hungry your guests are and what it is you want to give him obviously the outside pieces are going to be a little more cooked than the inside pieces but you see I have a slicer so you know remember I like it rare the medium rare it's up to you how do you like it my friends and this right there is rare the medium rare and it's absolutely gorgeous so remember foreign degrees and it will be cooked more for you it's up to you it all depends how you like it there's no right or wrong here it's really up to you I took it out at 118. you take it out of 125 127 a letter cook to 130 135 and then you'll have more of a medium rare medium it's really up to you that's the way I love it this is going to melt in my mouth this is gorgeous this you can see right there they spinoli mussels whatever it's going to be there this is going to be beautiful my friends look at this look at this this is going to be like like perfect oh oh and you see it's very elegant those are beautiful and arrogant is glorious mmm also friends we're going to serve it with the ocean this is yoshu then we made we have a link right there for this um oh got friends that hope you make it we're gonna slice the pretty make a beautiful thumbnail out of it this is another way to prepare a prime rib friends I hope you make it remember thumbs up if you liked the video subscribe to the channel and ring that Bell thanks for watching okay friends I almost forgot to show you something very important you see the reason why we cooked it slowly at the beginning and finished with the hot heat at the end is to avoid the gray line if you notice it's cooked to Perfection from one end to the next same exact one so it's very important to cook it slowly first okay that just want to make sure I didn't forget to show you that [Music];['segundos']
BInghsrnS_g.json;hello everybody it is Michael Brownstein here from the food and wine Life channel and I'm here with the beautiful ever play and today Eva is going to make beef bourguignon beef bourguignon is everybody's favorite in my household uh it's a great holiday dish it doesn't take long to make and it's a traditional French dish today I made the bourguignon that is very simple easy to follow directions and it's not that complicated like everybody is trying to make it out to be so I hope you've enjoyed this recipe it comes out every time it comes out delicious smooth the the flavors the texture and it's a real crowd pleaser [Music] okay so first step in our beef bourguignon will be we'll add a little bit of butter just for flavor and a little bit um olive olive oil in our pan just to coat it slightly okay and since our pan is pretty hot I'll just melt it melt the powder pretty quick and then we'll add some bacon roughly chopped bacon that's about six ounces and 12 Brown it we'll cook it till it's brown and starting to crisp up so now since uh our bacon browned a little bit um well take it out of the pot drain it a little bit and put it in the another container because we'll use it later do that okay let me do this yeah that um if you're cooking on this uh gas stove make sure you don't burn yourself so okay so now we're gonna add a little bit of beef at the time so it Browns nicely and easily on each side we don't want to overdo it so a few pieces at the time [Music] and it's called Browner and we'll repeat the steps like we did with the bacon foreign the beef right now to a nice caramelized edges so when the beef Browns then we'll add it to the pot where the bacon is so right here I made some homemade crushed pepper from all peppercorns like this and um this is just way better you can use a small food processor to um to grind your peppercorns and to add extra flavor to the whole dish okay after we Brown all the beef and we place that to another pot [Music] well add a little bit more butter to this okay so let's cut this a little bit maybe a tablespoon of butter whatever you need and melt it and we'll put our carrots in it and we'll cook them a little bit to Brown them so after a little while uh we'll add our onions I have two chopped onions in here and again we'll spread the onions a little bit okay so now we'll add our garlic to the mixture and we'll cook that for a minute but while we're doing that we also can add um our bay leaves I put four bay leaves they're pretty good but um I use them for aromatics and I love aromatics in my dishes plus the fresh ground pepper [Music] and a few pinches of salt but be careful with salt because we'll add stock to it and salty already so now we'll add our flour okay and we'll coat all the veggies with the flour so we don't get lumps and next we add our stock and two cups of beef stock okay we'll mix it a little bit and then we have two cups of wine red wine I have Cabernet Sauvignon you can use any wine that you drank I would suggest do not use cooking wine or anything that you wouldn't drink so my my base my sauce was getting a little thick so I added a cup of water to it you can add more water because um it depends on the moisture of the flour sunflower has a little bit more water depends on your pantry and where you live Etc so I guess the flowering in This was um need it a little bit it was dry so I needed more moisture so then I'll add about a tablespoon or two some let me stir around and a little bit of uh thyme and I love thyme so I'll put a little bit more than you might like but thyme is really good in it and we'll cook it down and then we can take out the I sprayed at the end and right now after we have all that done we'll add the meat and the bacon that we cooked previously okay so now we have our bacon and our beef all together with the sauce we'll stir around so it coats easily but all our aromatics salt and pepper and we're getting ready to put it um in the oven for about three to four hours okay so it's ready to go into the oven so we're cooking it for about three to four hours in the oven part of beef bourguignon that when you're at this stage you just put in the oven for about three at 300 degrees and leave it in the oven for about two and a half to three hours I'll check after that time see where you're at with your dish and in the meantime you can work on your side dishes so we're going to check on our progress looks really good uh let me get a little fork in here and see if it's fork tender oh no it's it's about a couple more hours that's for sure we're at Mark of hour and a half so it's starting to look great and smells great wait okay so we had some olive oil and now we're adding a little butter we're gonna melt the batter and we'll saute the mushrooms to finish up our beef bourguignon Dish as you can see on the back we have we started some potato for mashed potatoes I'm gonna serve them with potatoes today so as we melted our butter we'll add our mushroom and we'll satayam until they get the brown and then we'll finish them up with salt pepper and a little bit of garlic so we just took out our beef bourguignon from the oven oh oh it's fork tender definitely so it's ready for us to add our mushrooms so right now we have those cooked mushrooms beautifully browned I'm gonna add them to the dish it's heavy okay and then we're gonna stir it together and we'll wait for the potatoes to cook and we'll be ready to serve our dinner this is the finished product over the mashed potatoes with little green chives well we're back and we're fixing to do a taste test let's see so as you can tell the beef is fork tender let's see and uh the sauce looks very smooth silky oh yeah maybe yeah I did yourself on this one you like it yeah you did a great job well it was simple just few hours in the oven the rest easy peasy so um we'll see you next time cheers cheers;['segundos']
BPsRVwNvorM.json;well hello there friends fantastic video today i'm going to show you how to make the most tender the most delicious skirt steak with the chimichurri sauce stay tuned i'm going to show you how to do it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel then ring that bell stay tuned we're making right now together [Applause] well hello there friends let me show you how easy it is to do this and if we're going to marinate a meat a piece of meat scotch steak friends is the piece to do look how big that is and this is actually a lot of people cut it the wrong way so they find it not to be very tender but this is actually very tender the secret is to cut it against the grain and i'll show you how to do that but right now what we're going to do we're going to marinate it first of all if we're going to buy a skirt steak you want to buy a one from the outside the skirt steak comes from the in the front of the animal in the in the belly in the itself in the plate um just behind the bliss where the brisket is which is in the front of it they know in the back there's a plate over the belly and it's in front of the belly and it's the outside you want to get and uh and and it's uh it looks like a a lot of fat in there we love that fat that fat is going to give us a lot of flavors it's going to help us penetrate it and sometimes they're quite thick this is a really nice thick piece and we're going to do we're going to cut it in pieces so then when we slice it we're going to slice it with the grain it's really simple not difficult at all i'm going to show you how to do it but this if you're going to marinate a piece of meat this is the piece of meat you want to marinate so we're going to cut it in about the size then we can handle to cut it a sideways so this is gonna be uh perfect right there about that size so we got right there we got a lot uh uh and this one this one i have no choice i'm gonna make two little pieces but you'll see when i cut it you're going to really like it the way i'm going to do it frank all right so we got some garlic that's going to give us some flavor a little flavor in the marinading the purpose of it is to introduce a little bit of flavor marinating any meat it really goes maybe one or two millimeter into the meat which is a beautiful thing for square steak because it's so thin so if you're going to marinate something this is a piece of meat you want to marinate a little bit of time and just crunch like this a little bit of rosemary we love it we love a little bit of the oil right there the essence of the rosemary and then what else do we need in the marinade now good marinade needs a little bit of acid the acid is going to help us breast break the connecting tissue make the meat a little more tender so i'm using a beautiful sherry vinegar use a good vinegar whatever vinegar you have then you want to eat we definitely want to use a good oil i'm using a tuscan olive oil or a garlic olive oil the olive oil is going to help us make it sticky really important and salt we need salt in there like when we do the brine that help us introduce moisture really important so a little salt in here that helps us make those flavor goes in soy sauce i like to put a little bit of worcestershire sauce yes again some salty products nice flavor umami flavors also wonderful to have okay and we're gonna put some fresh black pepper and we're gonna put a little bit more salt just a little bit more salt and then we're going to put just a little bit more oil i'm using a tuscan herb olive oil the garlic olive oil is wonderful we're going to mix all this together and then we're going to marinate this and probably the dish i have is just slightly a little too big but it's okay we're gonna marinate this for about remember acid will break down connecting tissues sometimes too much so we have to be careful not to marinate marinated too long okay this will be very happy to be marinated for three four hours no more than that three four hours it's thin um the vinegar will get through it and uh it's gonna be nice and acid it's gonna be beautiful all right we're gonna let that marinade every so often just flip it over it's great to do on a grill uh or great to do on uh um in a pen syrup you and and do it in the oven if you don't have a grill but this is perfect for the grill okay we'll let it go like this for um three four hours and i'll see you on the other side when it's nicely marinated okay friends meat has been marinated the grill pan is hot we don't have a grill in the studio so i put a nice green pan i got this stuff that's a beautiful grill pan and um so we're going to grill them and while the meat is grilling we're going to make a little chimichurri sauce and that's a very simple olive oil and herbs and garlic and it's got like a best pesto without the nuts and without the cheese so we're going to make a chimichu sauce so what we're going to do is see the grill marks right there the pan we're going to use let me make sure my heat is good we're going to put the the mysore muscle fiber in the same direction as a grill band so it's going this way it's going this way okay and same directions as the muscle fibers are going and you'll see why in a minute when we cut it i got an extra piece over there that i had it's gonna make a lot of smoke that camera over here is not gonna like it so what we're gonna do also friends um we're gonna leave that alone for a minute and we're gonna make the chimichurri sauce very simple and chimichurri sauce let me get a spoon right there uh it's just a little bit of chopped garlic i made it in advance because i like to seal it i like to make it to the way it sits a little bit for like a couple of hours if you have the time to do it i just want to make a little bit of it for you for you guys right there a little bit of parsley a little bit of cilantro i know a lot of people don't like cilantro it's because sometimes cilantro is overdone but if it's not overdone it's delicious a little bit of french fresh oregano can't find oregano don't worry about it don't put it in there i like to put oregano in there and i got this beautiful roasted garlic olive oil or you could use a tuscan herb olive oil which is wonderful which is why we're using a marinade use garlic olive oil you stress gonna do whatever olive oil makes you happy it's really really that simple folks you see look you can't get any more simple than this right and then i got this um uh scotch bannet pepper this thing is so hot you got to be careful friends and if you're going to use it you don't have to use it i just kind of like to use it a little bit i use it i remove all the seeds because the seeds is really really hot friends we don't want those seeds right there you know if you're sensitive your skin is sensitive use some rubber gloves in there they're really hot but if you put very little of it you're going to be just fine as long as you use very very little and what i like to do and i have to cut them in very fine julienne see very very fine julienne see look how fine that is fine fine fine fine fine julienne right and then we take that fine julienne and we cut it in very very small dice you see a child could do this but don't let them do it it's too hot and you put this in there let me tell you this is not just going to give you some heat friends it's going to give you an amazing flavor scotch bonnet pepper are wonderful so you go one scotch bonnet pepper goes a long way friends so don't use too much of it okay let me see how we doing with my heat over here yeah we're doing good let me check with my um we're doing good are we're not going to do it yeah we're doing good we need to cook a little bit more this is very thin they're going to cook in no time at all so you see look very simple right all right you got this i've already made this one in advance that's the one i'm going to use that ac i like to just uh marinate it like that leave it in the fridge in the fridge for a day or so three days you can leave it don't worry about it it's gonna last okay i reduced the heat a little too much earlier let's see how we're doing over here friends we are we're doing good except it's not really giving me the beautiful mark that i want so we're not doing so good i've reduced the heat too much not supposed to do this so leave it alone you know what i'm going to do friends i'm going to make some quick little potatoes i got look at quit look at those potatoes one last time you seen potatoes that's small they're pretty cool right they call those baby potatoes you know what we're gonna do we're gonna use the chimichurris then we have right there we're gonna put it in a pan and we're just gonna saute them that's all we're gonna do well i poached them first in advance they are already cooked you see they're already cooked so what i gotta do i gotta got a butter one in there and i'm just gonna saute them really quick so if you can't find a little one like that you can find those nouvelle potato that's usually the color they are red or white cut them in half boil them in water first okay let's see how we're doing now hope we're getting enough color we're not already getting the color that i wanted it's because again i reduced it i was afraid i was that's what i was looking for right here that's what i was looking for right here friends not enough color i didn't get enough heat i was afraid to put too much smoke for the camera but it's okay i'm gonna let them rest for a minute let's do this potato really quick so all i do is saute the potato i mean push the potato in water until they cook they got to be cooked okay they got to be cooked completely because you're not going to cook them in there you're just going to reheat this this oil and herb and garlic and we know we don't want to burn this we'll put it right in there like this the only thing we're going to do at this point friends is put a little bit of pepper a little bit of salt and pepper and let me tell you those are going to be amazing little potatoes that's simple your cooking don't have to be complicated all the time all we want to do is warm them up a little bit warm them up a little bit that's all we're interested in doing all right let's see i hope i get some colors in here friends i'm looking for some maya reaction here and uh we're here right here you know what i'm not gonna cook this much longer my friend because if i do they're gonna be overcooked this is very thin you see just a second or two okay i think we're done we're going to let it rest to meet the rest a little bit and then we're going to cut i'm going to show you i want to show you the trick folks now if you notice the muscle fiber they're running parallel parallel to each other running parallel to each other the idea is to reduce the size of the muscle fiber to make it tender so you never cut with a grain you see a lot of people cut with a grain whenever you see that change channel okay i think we're done friends i'm just going to leave them in there for a second to let them rest and like i said the secret is to let it rest for a second to begin with and then number two here we go that's what i'm looking for right here see i got some nice color here friends finally mama mia finally finally found you we're gonna let it rest for a second and then we're gonna slice him and i'm gonna show you the right way to do it it's very important and this is perfect for the grill but if you don't have a grill like i said take a fry pan and do it now if you happen to be very thick on it you maybe want to be careful not to get them too brown on the outside because it's going to take a while to cook the inside sometimes they thick when you buy also your uh steak you want to make sure you buy it from the outside skirt steak you gotta put from the outside not the inside of the belly okay you gotta stay on there inside or outside if it doesn't say on the board it's probably not from the outside probably from the inside which means it's not going to be a standard you know you can buy choice you can buy prime if you can afford it by prime but if you count then by choice it'll be fine also all right let's see how we're doing with the potato okay we're good the potatoes are good i don't want to burn them see they're nice and hot what's going to make them even better is a little black pepper in there all right see how simple that was now we're going to cut them friends this is where we know how it goes okay so let's take now you're going to understand why i cut them in little pieces like that okay what we're going to do now we're going to take them and we're going to cut them a little bit of an angle i don't want to give it too much of an angle if i give it too much of an angle as much as they're going to be the same thickness the muscle fiber is going to be too big so we take it and we flip it like this friends see look look remember when you do with a knife you do long stroke and you flip and look up beautiful that is friends look how beautiful that is let me tell you my friends this got thin thin thin thin okay not too much of an angle i wanted to show you i wanted to show you just look at this you see this my friends melt in your mask and melt in your mouth this is amazing all we're going to do is we're going to put our potatoes in there and then oh there you go bon appetito just like this my friends now you can also take that chimichurri sauce that we made and put a little bit on it you can put you know you can do a nice paper i didn't do it i suppose presentation here normally i'm so much better at it than this you know i wasn't paying attention i was more interested in the eating that i was interested in making a nice presentation here what's wrong with me sometimes i wonder about it look at this you gorgeous you put it right in there you eat this you eat it right in there my friend you eat this thing right on there hey stay here you stay right there and you take that chimichurri sauce with this right there my friends and you put it right in there yeah this the flavor we're gonna get out of this my friend is just amazing that's how you serve it really simple dig it in i'm telling you a mess in your mouth friends i hope you

c1CbErl26UM.json;hi guys welcome to my youtube channel in this video I'll be sharing a recipe for garlic butter chicken if you new to my channel please consider subscribing by clicking the subscribe button here for this recipe you're going to need the following ingredients you're going to need chicken breasts boneless chicken breasts some garlic some flour this is all-purpose flour you're going to need only a few seasonings some smoked paprika some salt and some dried parsley you can use the fresh one if you prefer you also need some butter and I'm serving this with some couscous but you can serve it with whatever you like first I'm going to start by cutting the chicken into bite-size pieces make sure that all of your chicken are cut into the same size so that they could cook evenly and at the same rate [Music] [Applause] [Music] then get a paper towel and pat dry your chicken pieces we don't want any water on it because we're going to season and we want the seasoning to stick so you get a paper towel and dry up your chicken and make sure there's no water left on it you're going to want to transfer it to a bowl so that you can add the seasoning and mix it up in there next I'm adding my smoked paprika my parsley and my salt and then a tablespoon of all-purpose flour the flour is going to help the seasoning stick to the chicken where we cook it now mix everything up together make sure you mix it properly so that there is no seasoning left in the bowl you want everything that you've put in to stick to the chicken [Music] [Applause] [Music] and a frying pan I'm going to add some butter and allow this to melt [Music] her turn them might heat way before time so my frypan got too hot and I had to turn it off but I've turned it back on now I'm going to add a little bit of oil I'm using butter and oil for this recipe because I want the flavor of the butter but I don't want it to burn as I'm cooking my chicken so and make snow it's a bit of oil when it's hot adding your chicken pieces make sure not to crowd your frying pan so do this in batches it doesn't matter if you do it two or three times so it's important that you don't crowd the frying pan so they chicken doesn't boil instead it fries after a couple of minutes turn them over to the other side about two minutes turn all the pieces over and cook the other side for another two minutes [Music] I'm going to mince my garlic and add it in now for flavor and then I'm going to stay everything up together for another 1 minute until my chicken is properly cooked once this is ready I'm going to take it out add some more butter to the frying pan and do the next batch I'm not going to add any garlic in the next batch because there's still some garlic left in this oil and I don't want the garlic to overpower the chicken when you're doing this make sure you keep an eye on it cause it will burn if you leave it too long you can't go anywhere need to stand with it and it doesn't really take a long time cooking chicken that you've cut into bite-sized pieces like this don't really take a long time in five minutes one whole batch will be done and you can start on the next batch I had put up a picture on Instagram with this garlic butter chicken but I had served it with some plantain and some fried yam and it was so good when I put the picture people wanted me to share the recipe so here's the recipe for you guys but in this video I'm having it with couscous you can have it with anything that you want you can make an extra dip for it and have it with something else if you prefer that this chicken is really versatile you can really have it with anything that you want you can even have them on their own as a snack [Music] [Applause] now that his butt just cooked I'm going to take it out and his time to make the couscous [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the oil that's left in the frying pan I'm going to add some water just enough to cook my couscous I'm cooking just a little over half a cup of couscous so I'm going to add about a cup of water my water was already boiling so I'm going to add in my Crisco straightaway I'll add a pinch of salt to this I'm turning off the heat stir it cover it and allowed to steam I don't cook my couscous on heat at all I turn off the heat once I have the water boil it and the steam will do the rest for me otherwise you end up with soggy couscous and I really do not like soggy couscous I don't like soggy anything to be honest look how nice my couscous is looking you can see the individual grains I added a little bit of parsley off-camera because I wanted a hint of flavor in my couscous also but you don't have to you can cook your couscous plain and have it with a sauce if you want I'm just gonna go ahead and serve my couscous now with my chicken and I tell you this was so yummy even want to make a gravy for yours if you want but I didn't have in mind this way and I tell you it was super delicious I hope you've enjoyed watching this

cPV3P2z7XHg.json;folks beef stroganoff another fabulous classic and a delicious and easy recipe to make i know you're gonna like it don't forget if you like the recipe gives us a thumbs up don't forget to ring the bell so every thursday you get a notification when i put out a new video and please subscribe we love to have you subscribe to our channel thanks for watching you're going to love making this recipe here we go okay friends well this is a redo we're going to redo a recipe than we did about eight years ago on youtube uh and uh it was shot with old technology so now we got four k's so we're gonna do the recipe but it's a good thing because uh it's gonna be even a better recipe uh and it's gonna have a little history attached to it because uh in eight years then that old recipe was post we certainly got some feedback from everybody from uh the dishes from russia and now it's from france no it's from poland now it's from god i heard it from every country well i'll tell you a little story in a minute tell you exactly where it comes from but let me get going uh because when you make a big beef stroganoff you can certainly make it with a t-bone steak you can make it with the new york shrimp then you can slice thin and you can make it really fast or you can make it with a chuck roast and if you can't get chuck roast then you can get the stew meat and you can get at the butcher shop or you can this is a chuck roast and i cleaned up uh and and we're going to do it it's very simple i mean it's simple it requires a little prep as you can see all my recipe requires a little prep by the way and a quick note for those of you that have never seen my uh my uh uh channel first uh this is not a quick recipe one two three it's a recipe then if you have your mison plus and you're ready we can do it together at the same time it's real cooking it's not like a tic tac taco they don't even target they do like a two and three second recipe and uh a little voice over and you go ahead and and you figure it out well here i'm doing it with you uh so if you want to uh make you have your mison plus ready that means everything chopped and that's ready to go then we can do it together so i hope you have it you can download the recipe on our website print it get your museum plus ready and then come back and we'll do it together so we have a a fry pan going and we also have a a pot an enamel caster and pot that i'm gonna cook the stew in okay first thing we're gonna do is we're going to saute some onion and we're going to saute the beef i already got some sauteed right here that i did earlier to save some time i'll talk about that in a little while but let me first get going number one thing we're going to do is uh uh we're gonna saute the onion and and the onion remember the onion is always first always first doesn't matter whether you're cooking doesn't matter if you're making a soup if you're making a stew if you're making a sauce i don't care what you're making the onion is always number one that's gotta remember that and and and you don't put anything with it i don't care if you having uh celery and carrots and leeks and whether you don't put them at the same time whenever you see somebody putting the garlic and all the vegetables at the same time with the onion i highly recommend you go to the playboy channel maybe you learned something nah i didn't say that so uh we're gonna saute the onion and then we're going to saute the beef we got to make sure the the fry pan is super hot i'm looking at like 365 and i'm going to saute the beef and uh and this is very important it doesn't matter if you're making if you're doing it with a the only thing that matters is cooking time if you're doing it with a a a new york strips or if you're doing it with another meat you have to cook a very short amount of time but if you're doing it with a chuck roast which i think is one of the best meat to do a stew with um is you want to really really take the time to caramelize the meat so first we're gonna put a little salt and pepper on both dish right measure carefully the salt and pepper right there i can hear the recipe police from youtube oh he's not measuring hey cooking is not rocket science folks we're not sending a man on the moon we're just making a little bit too so it's okay if it's at all different every time we make it it doesn't really matter i'm going to move this stock a little bit out of the way so right here why are we doing this let's talk a little bit about this like i said this is a recipe then then i teach you along you know i've been doing this for 50 years and in 50 years you'll be amazed how many things i've heard or i've learned throughout the years so it's a it's a wonderful opportunity for me to be able to teach you the reason why we're doing this right here friends is uh we really want to brown the meat i try not to put too much uh meat in the pan so they don't crowd each other it doesn't you're not stewing the meat it really wouldn't matter that much if we did it in this case because that meat's going to require two and a half hours of cooking time so if if it stays a little bit too long and a flight pattern it really doesn't matter what we want what we want friends is to create right here this mala reaction i hope you can see this right there you see that that mala reaction right there this is the carmelization of protein and this friends is super super important flavor i mean really really really important flavor also you know i have a another youtube recipe on um on youtube that's where you get youtube recipe it's my beef stew it's very similar to this a different wine a different kind of cooking method but it's very very similar to this so if you like to be student you should check out a beef stew recipe also it's a wonderful recipe i'll tell you right so remember now we are satin on you you see what i'm talking about right the carbonization right there friends i hope you can see it right there i'm moving across to the camera not sure if we can get a close look out of this but and orlais macaroli but it's very important that we take the time to do this this is flavor friends clever flavor flavor flavor we really got to do this okay so let's look at what we got here we got caramelized onion you see you see caramel donut that's what i was looking for caramelized onion okay look very very simple right we're gonna put some fresh thyme and then we're going to saute our mushrooms all right a mushroom what a mushroom made out of water water is the enemy we want to get rid of all the water we want to get rid of all the water in the mushroom because mushrooms are full of water and i don't like the texture of it you know a lot of people don't don't like mushroom it's not that they don't like mushroom flavor they just don't like the texture of it so we're gonna get rid of it all okay holy mackerel this is very hot this is what i'm looking for right there actually i'm good i am really good right here you see this is all that caramelization right here look how beautiful that is friends if you could be here right now smell you were like oh man can i ate some of that well you certainly can you can come back and eat some of my food right there look at this you know what we're going to do friends we're going to deglaze that pan [Music] we're going to deglaze that pan right there i'm scrubbing it right there i am scraping what we call the phone the phone f-o-n-d that's the combination of the protein in the bottom of the fry pan right there it's going to be delicious oh so let's get rid of the water in the mushroom one more thing friends the mushrooms i sauteed the mushrooms i sauteed the mushrooms i mean i'm sorry i cut them in quarters whenever you're braising a mushroom that means you're going to be cooking it in a wet environment submerged with liquid you want to quarter them or six them or ate them if they're very big because they maintain a better texture okay so if you slice them and you cook them for two and a half two two and a half hours they're gonna be nothing so it's really really important then you take the time to do this okay now could you do everything in the same pan at home you probably could do all this in the same pan you probably could do all this in the same pen let me remove some other stuff i don't need and then i'm going to start to be able to put some ingredient also in a minute garlic by the way folks garlic i have a video to show you how to smash your garlic no not to smash how to make a garlic puree but if you haven't seen it this is an easy way to do right there you just smash it on the board right because you got to put our garlic in there right and then we're just going to chop it fine you just chop it fine [Music] and we don't have to chop it too fine because you see it's gonna cook for two and a half hours so we don't need to worry too much about it having it too fine here's a small one right there so i'm gonna put all this back in there because i'm not ready for the garlic i just wanted to prepare it so i have it right there ready let's see how we're doing with everything okay the beef i stopped it for a minute i'm good let me see if all the water is out of my mushroom this is doing pretty good it's doing very good friends all right we're gonna put a little bit of tomato puree very little okay very very little because my beef stew already got tomato in there might be stuck so we don't need a lot we're going to put the garlic and how long do we cook the garlic for we cook it however long it takes to release fragrance and as soon as you smell your garlic you're going to put some liquid on it be strong enough believe it or not folks got white wine not red wine classical recipe i'll talk about this in a minute all right because there's uh there is a uh a youtube recipe police i don't know where they get the information from sometimes when i hear the comment they make mamma mia carrots diced carrots we're gonna let those cook for a minute we're gonna let the wine reduce for a minute it's very important when you're putting wine to let it reduce now let me stop for a second and tell you a couple things number one a classical beef stroganoff and i mean classical as per if you know i'm one of those this is for chefs okay it's not something you wanna i was gonna put it on my counter but hold on hey this is not the kind of book then um my counter has got little stuff on it i don't want to put my book on it is the bible for chefs if you will okay it's a it's a real dictionary for chefs okay and and if you don't sometime where a recipe come from and i heard so many different things about where the strawberry come from everybody got an idea oh i come from there i come from there in the meantime i'm letting the white wine reduce so i'm not killing too much time i just wanted to explain it okay now the ingredients in by the way it's it's it's troganov it's the right spelling of the word it's not shrugging off but if we call it stroganoff nobody knows what that is but that's the real name of it and and according to the larus gastronomic which is the bible of of all chefs all over the world the story goes in the according to the to the book another book or so-called a test of russia the original beef stroganoff recipe derived from a basic french mustard for seasoning beef combined with the dollop of of russian sour cream so whether the recipe recipe comes from he says accept the story of the beef stroganoff is an a french chef called charles briere which is almost like my last name i have nothing to do with charlotte i don't know is who worked for a wealthy sem pistol saint-petersburg family created this dish for a cooking contest in 1891 and he won the contest and he named the uh the dish after his employer and his employer was was the count patel alexandrovich stroganoff and that's the dude that's the dude i took a picture of it to show you but of course i can't open it but that's the dude right there so jack is gonna put a nice picture of it on the screen so you guys can see who he is but that's the dude and the ingredients are very simple okay those are the classical ingredients right there the beef changes depends what it is you want to do but if you want to do just a plain beef 2 we're going to take it right there friends look and you know what we're going to do all that goodie down there we're going to deglaze it with a little bit of white wine all right we're gonna deglaze it right there a little bit of white wine and another thing that tells you the classical way of doing it is then you would um marinate the uh uh the the beef overnight with uh white wine and carrots and bay leaf and celery overnight you would marinate but you know what who's got time to do this okay i think it'll be perfectly fine as long as we cook at the right time look look my fried pan right there i got all that goodies in there right now i'm going to take the beef then i sauteed this afternoon oh one of them went on went on the floor there's no dog here in the studio so we're gonna put in the garbage oh man this is that so we're gonna put it all right there all right let me take my book out of here before it gets so messed up and then we're gonna put a little bit of brown sugar very little very little brown sugar right and i'm gonna show you a cool trick if you've seen my beef stock recipe you've seen the trick you know what it is and now we're gonna put the stock okay so this is of course a beautiful stock and and not everybody's got access to a beautiful stock like this uh you know i run a professional school and kitchen so it's easy for us to do but so what do you do at home you can buy a good beef beef stew beef broth if you see one in the store then it's very nice the problem is there's not many places where you can get a good beef broth so if you wanted to start from scratch you can i have an old recipe on youtube which we're going to reshoot eventually but right now it's pretty good it's a beef stew recipe then you have a few dish type chef jumpier beef stew you'll see it's really wonderful in fact that's the recipe that's the recipe right there that's that's my beef stew recipe than you have on youtube but if you don't want to go through this um this will work to do this you can start you can buy a beef broth then it's decent you know try a few of them to see which one you like right beef broth and then you can add some tomato paste to it and cook it for a little while and if you have some extra leeks carrot celery and onion or meat trimming you can put it in there and let it cook for a while and then you you portion it in in like eight to 10 12 16 ounce container whatever you got and you can freeze it you know lasting your freezer forever and then you got a beautiful beef stock because at the end of the day friends the stock makes a very very big difference okay so now we're going to thicken this now another thing you could do you can do so many things you can make a roof and thicken with the roof but a lot of you don't have time to make a rule right so you can put flour in there and i see a lot of people mixing and mixing flour with water mamma mia please don't do that and they do it at the end you got to put the flour at the beginning so it has time to cook and so we're going to do it now uh for those of you that have seen my uh my uh bish2 recipe you know what i'm going to do but for those of you that have not seen it i'm going to scare you oh what happened if i did that no no no not so good so we're not going to do that we're going to take a strainer all right we're going to put the strainer in in the stew okay and we're going to thicken this with flour like i said if you have a root by all mean roux equal amount of flour equal amount of butter it's best if you use a clarified butter but for those of you that don't cook you want to make it easy and that's the whole idea of my channel it's for you to be able to cook fabulous food but it's easy to make so far i haven't done anything you cannot do right so now we're going to take a little flour i try to make it easy and then take this right there look and mix it up you see you see look look look look how easy the flower incorporates you don't even see it right well let me tell you something no lumps is ever going to be created this way you see so here we go we're going to take this we're going to put a little more flour in here because it needs just a little bit more and we're just going to go in like this you see we're going to mix it up and it's going to incorporate it as long as you just mix it you see look and if you don't have enough it doesn't makes just go deeper that's all let me turn the heat off a little bit because it's really getting hot in there you see look and the idea is to incorporate all the flour and you want to do this at the beginning of the cooking process friends you don't want to wait the end you want to do this at the beginning of the cooking process because at the end if you do it at the end the flour doesn't have time to cook okay look all right so now you see you watch what's gonna happen and you want to kind of like let's let it loose a little bit you see and then we're going to finish this with uh we're going to cook some beautiful egg noodles and and then we're going to put the sour cream and the chives to finish it up this is going to be delicious this is going to require about two two and a half hours to cook because we're using chuck roast if you were to use a another meat then you would cook it a lot less you you would cut it a little different you would cut it in strips but this right there friends is absolutely beautiful you see look we're gonna let it cook and then we're gonna finish it up later with uh uh let me put a little more salt and pepper in there a little and salt and we're just gonna cook with adjust the salt and pepper till the end but this friends it's gonna be absolutely wonderful and like i said we're gonna serve it with a large egg noodle maybe a papadella maybe a fettuccine and we'll put that in the bottom of the plate and then we're gonna put it on top with uh sour cream and chives it's gonna be delicious and that's it that's the um classical you know what we'll do we'll put a description of it i'll spill the uh la rus gastronomic on on the website on a recipe so when somebody ask you where that dish come from you at least you have an educated opinion all right we'll be back when it's all cooked after two two and a half hours okay well here we are we cook it about two and a half hours uh it's uh wonderful already nice and soft i can tell so at this point there's a few things we need to do one we need to put a little dijon mustard in it because it's uh it's traditional you put dijon and and don't worry about cooking mustard okay a lot of people oh mamma mia look at this a lot of people um cook they are mustard you don't need to cook the mustard okay you really do not need to cook the mustard as my fact it's best if you don't cook the mustard okay there's no reason to cook it all right so here we go mix the mustard a little bit now at this point you can put a little bit of sour cream in there and a little bit of sour cream on top it's up to you what you want to do i'm going to put just a little bit of sour cream in here like this just a little bit of sour cream because it is nice a bit strong enough it's got a little bit of creaminess to it all right so we just mix it up really good nice all right and then we're going to serve it with a papadela pasta a large noodle a fettuccine is good whatever you want whatever whatever pasta you want you can even serve it with a with uh with a potatoes but you know it's kind of traditional to serve it with a with a pasta but serve it with whatever makes you happy and i say it's cooking it's not a rocket science right so be cooking with whatever is happy i put i did it the papadela pasta right there and uh and and i just put a little bit of butter on there it's surprised and put a little butter in there right and it's very easy all i do is i cook the pasta right and when they're a little bit al dente it's still a little bit of dente and then i take um uh a little bit of powder when they come out i drain it i keep a little bit of the water because i don't really mind the water or pasta right and and then i put a little bit of butter in there that's why we got this beautiful shine on it right okay so now what we're going to do we're going to take it we're going to take some of that beautiful stew right there we're going to put it right in the middle of it just right like that we'll try to keep the uh the the uh the meat in the middle of it if we can so we don't dirty the plate and uh and the noodle around it okay put as much or as little as you want all right this is very simple dish friends okay and if you mess up the plate like i just did right there you just clean it up okay don't be out there serving dirty plates now remember the plate is a bigger the plate more of a canvas you have right and then what we do we take a little bit of the sour cream just a little bit of the sour cream and you put it on top you don't have to put the sour cream on top if you don't want to you know it's your dish make it however you want it put a little bit of chives on there friends look at this look at see how simple that is right there let me tell you friends i know i dare this uh youtube recipe police is gonna say that's not a stroganoff caller whatever you wanna call my friends but this is the classical stroganoff as per remember as per the larus gastronomic okay we have to have some kind of a bubble chefs and this is our bubble right there okay so friends this is wonderful you're gonna make this recipe i know you're going to love it

Cyskqnp1j64.json;beef wellington has to be the ultimate indulgence one of my all-time favorite main courses and it would definitely be on my last supper menu my version is a lot lighter and sexier and for christmas i'm going to give it an added twist first off the fillet of beef now look at it it's beautiful first the most important part is to sear it salt pepper the fillet is the leanest and the most expensive cut of beef it comes from underneath the lower backbone a part of the animal which has very little muscle and this is what makes it such a tender cut very very hot pan olive oil and literally roll it around the pan we're not cooking the beef we're just searing it which will really help to give another layer of flavor and beef in lovely now use the side of the pan so the beef sears down the back when you tilt it it's a secret to get it done quickly it gives that really nice roasted flavor delicious once you've got the colour very carefully lift up the beef and see it on top and sear it on the bottom out and onto the plate english mustard what this does now it gives it a bit of sort of bit of heat just lightly brush the mustard over the beef so really important that you do this as the beef comes straight out of the pan as the beef starts to cool down it absorbs all that heat from the mustard horseradish is a really nice alternative as well just leave that to sit and relax as the fillet rests prepare the filling which is called a duck sale put 700 grams of chestnut mushrooms into a blender add a chopped clove of garlic season with salt and pepper and blitz [Music] christmas wouldn't be christmas without chestnuts and just crumble them in to the mushrooms the chestnut sweet nutty flavor works brilliantly with the earthy taste of the mushrooms and because they contain more starch and less oil than other nuts they have a much softer texture that is perfect for the filling that smells amazing smells like christmas once the mixture is finely chopped cook in a hot dry pan this removes the water from the mushrooms and intensifies the flavour [Music] you can see the water coming out instantly [Music] such an essential stage really critical to the success of the wellington that you dry those mushrooms out and get rid of all that water take the mushrooms up even further some fresh thyme in there which will make it really nice and light and fragrant when all the water's been fried off remove from the pan and leave to cool then start assembling the wellington stage one wrapping the beef fillet first of all these wonderful slices of parma ham and look beautiful overlap it and set it there so the secret of overlapping the palmer ham is to make sure it contains all those juices coming out of the beef in the traditional recipe for beef wellington a thick chive and spring onion pancake is used instead of ham but the parmesan makes the dish much lighter and its sweet salty flavor really complements the mushroom and chestnut filling a little touch of pepper no salt because the ham is naturally salty just a little twist of pepper and then from there your mushrooms and basically mushrooms go on use the back of the spoon to spread them nice and thinly half an inch from the ends rump holes no hop it every time there's meat now he comes next lay the beef on top and very carefully fold that over now we're going to lift that up and wrap the beef nice and carefully so all that mushroom and parmesan is encasing the beef all the way over push it nice and tight roll it nice and tight and go all the way over now the secret from here is to really let the clint film do the work just nip it at the ends and squeeze and what we're doing is just creating this wonderful sort of cylinder shape off and then just twist it nice and tightly and the tighter is the more perfect the shape then place in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up [Music] once it's set it's ready for the final wrap a little bit of tim film puff pastry beef now very carefully first roll the puff pastry over the beef until the two edges meet then trim off any excess pastry and twist the ends together to ensure the beef is completely sealed in its pastry case to set that perfectly and get it really nice and firm to make it really cylinder type clip them over [Music] and just pull that nice and tight but the big secret behind this is that it can be done the night before and the tighter the clint film the better the shape the more even the shape the more evil it cooks put it back in the fridge for five minutes to fill up again then take off the tim film always like the perfect christmas cracker to give the pastry a lovely rich golden brown color when it bakes brush it with egg yolk and then finally you don't have to do this but it's a chefy thing a little bit decoration back of the knife down and then just twist and mark the pastry when it comes out of the oven it's got that wow factor add a generous sprinkle of salt to ensure the pastry becomes lovely and crisp then bake in an oven at 200 degrees for around 35 minutes depending on how rare you like your beef once out of the oven it's crucial you let the wellington rest for at least 10 minutes this allows the meat to relax and reabsorb its delicious juices making sure it's tender and succulent nice and gently hear that pastry how crisp that is this is the bit we've been waiting for oh wow my god i'm in heaven and for me if you want a really nice change to roast turkey this has to be the ultimate for the table it smells christmassy the chestnuts the mushrooms and that nice crisp pastry on the outside look at it i'm ready to die and go to heaven [Applause] [Music] you;['segundos']
dHKplYI3PHY.json;hey folks this your boy Jay rapid filling back with another video Philly boy Jay Philly boy Jay back in the building and today I'm gonna be making some pork chops now I did a video like this on my previous channel which is still available by the way PBJ show and I've also done pork chop recipes in the past I'll show you guys how to make mother baked pork chops and I showed you guys how to make smother fried pork chops this recipe is sort of like smothered fried pork chops I said we're not going to be coating the pork chops with flour okay we're gonna be frying them without flour but yeah you want to need five pork chops and you're going to need assi medium cut pork chops they probably don't refer to them as medium cut they usually only refer to them as thick or thin cut but these are in between thick and thin okay do not get thick cut pork chops for this recipe unless you're an experienced cook and you know how to get them nice and tender all right make sure that your pork chops are medium or thin cut okay and you're going to need five of them and we're gonna rinse the funk off of these pork chops I don't care what nobody saying people try to tell you that oh you ain't supposed to rinse me because of the spread bacteria listen this soothes my mind okay because I just can't bite me or put me in my mouth if I rinse it all with some salt and water first also salt and lemon juice or some salt and vinegar so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna rinse these pork chops off we're gonna remove some of the excess fat and we don't get the cooking now we ain't gonna move all this fat because the fans would give you food what it give it flavor that Philly boy Jay you know I made my food Billy stop Billy is a soulful city we are about flavor okay so waiting taking all of this fat off but we will be taking some off okay so let's do that now because we're not deep-frying knees I'm definitely doing some like look at all that right there come now look at all that that water is dark and dirty and I don't want all that floating in my or you okay I ain't gonna let don't owe you that I'm cooking my food and remove the funk I'm gonna remove it before I put it in there you know me so that's just my take on a cleaning of music but just want to rub it rub the salt water solution up against the chops like that and that's pretty much it you gonna take them out a season we're going to be using some black pepper some paprika I like that freaking because I like the color that it gives food so I put paprika on pretty much every meat that I cook if you guys notice we're going to be using some garlic powder some onion powder and some parsley flakes the parsley flakes give it a nice look it's just for decoration purposes more so okay and the paprika now for taste we're going to be using celery salt I use celery salt because I like my pork chops to have that subtly flavor if you don't have celery salt you can use adobo seasoning or salt okay or either seasoning salt all right so you can substitute the Sun result with a lot of different seasonings just make sure a has salt in it all right unless you can't have salt so these are the seasonings that you're going to need let's move on it's about the other ingredients we're going to be using you're going to need some chicken broth so there are pork chops have like a nice thin gravy and it's not going to be much gravy left over when we're done cooking the pork chops all right just gonna have a nice thin gravy or like a wetness okay to it um you want to need a small onion you want to need some margarine or butter and some cornstarch okay so make sure you have those ingredients alright guys so first thing that you're going to do is you're going to cut your onions and you're going to slice them into thin pieces all right so that's the way you want your onions in look we're going to move on down and create our slurry ok guys so here is our broth into your bra you're going to add your cornstarch okay and therefore once you stir this in stir it in until the cornstarch dissolves like that there okay guys so here are our pork chops we rinse them all so now we're going to season them and I'm going to add my celery salt first okay now I want them to be well seasoned so that's the celery salt we're going to add our onion powder and I just season one side and then rub it one to both sides okay um here is our garlic okay so drop it here's our free condoms when we give it a beautiful color and again for the full recipe with all the detailed instructions cooking time in measurements visit my website Billy Jay cooking dot-com okay here is our parsnip links and that's not least we're going to add some black pepper one a massage all of these seasonings in on both sides besides it everyone alright guys those are you well seasoned pork chops and they look well seasoned don't they I see the total bad boys 20 and you could tell that they are going to be extremely extremely flavorful because of silly folks we like our food to have flavor so we make sure that we season it not too much but breviary well let's move over to the stove now okay guys so we're going to be cooking our pork chops over medium-high heat if you have a dialer on your stove place it on about a seven okay that's about medium-high and I use this instead of for you because I like the flavor that it gives the foretop want that milk should go to add your hon you want a caramel a boon about a minute or two now we're going to add our pork chops and if I go up to brow down for little while Hey all right we're gonna turn our push off over let them round on the other side ok so now we're going to go ahead and add costs Larry and look at the color because we browned it and also we seasoned it with paprika we didn't need to add like any gravy master or anything to darken the gravy look at that some beautiful color we gotta add a thing right so just let this go for about 20 to 25 minutes you can cover it with a lid you want to get real tender and you're just going to cook this until the gravy cooks down a little more alright and that's pretty much it so I'll get back to you guys once our pork chops are all done okay and actually I think I'm going to cook it on medium heat not low medium okay I'm cooking on medium heat get back which one is done okay guys so our pork chops are done in the way that I make my pork chops when I'm making it this way is I always cut the pork chops fall once the gravy cooks down so you should be left with a rubbery thin gravy okay so we're going to cut the fire off now because they are done and we're going to get ready to play them this recipe it's really good with like eight noodles or rice okay but I'm getting ready to grow up and I'm gonna run these down with the hot sauce all right guys here are our pork chops these are gosh you gotta try this recipe these are amazing making it this way hmm I don't know what's my favorite way to make pork chops

Dpwiulx33OM.json;well hello there friends another fantastic recipe today i made a pot roast and i'm serving it with papadella pasta stay tuned i'm going to show you how to make it it melts in your mouth remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and by all means ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] well hello there friend let me show you how easy it is to make this sport roast this is the pot roast my mom used to make and she served with papadela pasta and on her memory we are going to cook it with pepper papadella pasta which is a large fettuccine and it's going to be delicious let's get going right away my friends today i'm going to try to do something i've never done before to use only one pot all right because i know a lot of you don't like to do dishes i don't blame you i don't like them either so i'm going to get going and then i'll talk a little bit about my mison plus okay i got a pot going one pot we're going to try to do one part i got a little clarified butter you don't have clarified butter friends use a good cooking oil whatever makes you happy okay try to get one with high smoke points um avocado oil is great high smoke bone vegetable oil whatever you want to use okay i use clarified butter if you don't know how to make clarified butter friends you got to check on our videos it's over there somewhere there's a link in there and and you'll learn how to make clarified butter it's really easy and then your high smoke point like 400 degrees 450 500 we don't build in with clarified butter it's wonderful my friends all right we're going to put a salt and pepper we're using a gr a top round a uh a chuck chuck rose czech roast not a top round a chuck roast chuck roast you can find that in most stoves um sometimes they call it a seven bone steak or the top one is different they're almost tough the top one is a little cheaper but this is wonderful my friends you can find that everywhere okay and um sometimes they call it a seven bone steak also it's got a little bone it looks like a seven in there we wanna make sure we're hot and we're looking at 365 degrees so a lot of people put flour on it supposedly to cook the flour it doesn't do a damn thing okay so don't waste your time putting the flour in it number one it interferes with the maya reaction which is creating that beautiful crust until we don't need it not now we're going to need it later and also you know what it does the flower will burn in the bottom of your pot and we have enough trouble as it is uh today we don't need any more trouble to create the flour will burn i promise you it doesn't do a thing i've done it with or without i've been doing like this for 50 years okay maybe more look we have hot we're going to put it in the pan and and we don't touch our friends we don't touch it that's it i'm telling you don't touch it all right let me wash my hand really quick my friends um we are going to uh to let it get the maya reaction and that's creating the caramelization reporting and it gives us a lot of flavor so what we're going to do normally i take a fry pan okay it's easy for me to take a fry pan and um let me make sure oh here we go i don't know well the camera when i was setting up i didn't want it to be too high so now all of a sudden not cooking anymore that's okay it'll be good we're not going to touch it you'll see it's going to be beautiful golden brown and we're not going to have to worry too much about the font and the bottom which is the carbonization you get in the bottom we just want to make sure we clean it so it does not burn okay so it's okay to use one part but you just got to pay attention of what's happening to your ingredients and we're going to find out in a second okay first we're going to let it do that's why you don't want to touch it right now let's get first of all two things if you touch it right now it's probably going to stick it's the same thing you do a stack in a frypan if you do a chicken on the grill right you put a chicken on the grill and and and after 30 seconds you want to play with it what happened it sticks right leave it three minutes then don't touch it you'll see what happened and i'm stick on thick is that a world right and unstick itself because the protein releases himself okay so it's important to leave it alone don't be playing with it we want to though right but we're not going to do it all right they only are big i cut big you see what i do and when i do friends i uh i want to show you how i cut the onion right so remember the root end of the orion and the top end of the onion right very rarely do we cut against the grain that's the grain right there right but in this case i want big piece of onion so i cut one time two times right you can see this right one two three i cut against the grain then i flip it and then i cut it like this big big big big because they're gonna cook two and a half three hours so now when i get to here what do i do here flip it you see otherwise too difficult right and voila now you got big cut on you see so remember one cut against the grain two cut against the grain flip it around now with the grain you see so now you get here what do you do what do you do there you go don't do this let it flip it right and and don't worry it doesn't matter this is not like uh uh very important they're gonna cook for three hours we don't want them to be too small if they're too small you know what's gonna happen friends if they're too small they're gonna completely disappear we don't want them now it looks like a lot of mono my onions are huge and and they're beautiful they're wonderful they're organic onions and i buy a whole food i love them they're wonderful um uh they're big and i don't think you can ever have too many oreo i mean really somebody's gonna say you know i like your roast but don't do much on yours get out of my kitchen on yo mushroom and you know the thing right you know the thing and what i do is i cut them in quarters i cut them in corn don't get me started i cut them in quarters you see look look you cut them boom boom in quarters if they're big i cut them in six segments i don't slice them what do you think we should check it no no yeah carrots beet carrots you see look look they're big remember that they're going to cook for a long time right celery's big also you're going to be flavored then i got rosemary and thyme chopped nice and i got a few cloves of garlic i got some red wine if you don't use red wine you don't have to use white wine what do you think what do you think oh baby you don't have to use red wine if you don't use white wine you don't need it you know if you don't drink it you don't miss it i would have a problem with it and my my household with all that uh worcestershire sauce a little bit of extra almighty flavor very nice okay and a little bit of stock okay so now very simple okay we got the thing we're putting it in here now look look look look at this look at this you see what i'm talking about friends this is just the create the maya reaction to get a beautiful crust around her now you hear a lot of people then tell you searing the meat seasoning the juices i don't know where they got that idea from okay it doesn't seal any juices it just creates the maya reaction i heard somebody the other day say that's why he puts the flour so the juices in i don't know what book or television they're watching but that doesn't do this okay we're gonna put it on flower because we're gonna need it after we put all that liquid in there we're gonna do it but we're not gonna do it that way so we're going to wait for the maya reaction to happen on the other side and then we're going to do it even on on the bottom right here because that's pretty big and when this is done we're going to come back to you and we're going to do the onion we're gonna do the mushroom so it's gonna be in stage okay i don't want the video to be too long my friends all right so stay tuned we'll be back in a few minutes when both sides are beautiful golden brown and and even a rounded also a golden brown okay so we'll be back in a few minutes you know jack it may be good when we're filming this then without a sound you can take the quick motion you know of me doing this right i think it'll be kind of cool to do a quick motion with your music what do you think okay friends look you see how beautiful that is look i even did the side right there both sides down they're beautiful okay and the smell of it is amazing so now let's deal with the pot okay because this spot is very hot first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to put the onion okay so now we're going to deal with those onion guys very carefully now let me explain you what happened here we got some fonts in the bottom you see right there you got the phone right there right so i'm taking a wooden spoon and i'm scraping them i am because if i don't scrape them they're going to burn friends so that's the only issue about having uh only one pot you have to be careful with the bottom of your pot then you get rid of all the foam those are wonderful the combination of protein is delicious this is all flavor friends so we want to make sure we get it all all right we're going to continue we'll be back in a few minutes when the onions are really beautifully caramelized okay okay friends we are back and uh and the onion and nicely caramelized now we're going to put the mushroom remember now it's very important to have this order my friends okay very important we got the orders because if we don't have the orders uh then you put everything at once if you put the mushroom at the same time you put the onion you get all the water from the onion and it's gonna be very difficult to caramelize the onion you're gonna have to wait for all the mushrooms for the onion to escape the pot before the onion caramelized and you're never really gonna get them nice but if you do it this way one time at a time you know what i i know i explain all the time and i'm gonna be redundant of some of you but forgive me uh we you know it's amazing uh uh last month we had like 60 70 80 000 new subscribers it's really amazing and all those people have never seen never heard me say that so i know a lot of you have heard me many times but it's okay you know it is what it is folks we're here to learn and to have some good time and have some great food so look i want to show you i'll show you look at the bottom of my you see a nice and clean that is you see nothing burn same pot so i use one pot i've been trying to use only less spot because everybody's telling me use too much pot what would help me get rid of the um the water in a mushroom salt and you know what we have so many fabulous salt we have a garlic salt it's not that garlic salt you buy a grocery store okay i promise you this this garlic salt right here my friend is amazing mediterranean sea salt with roasted garlic okay this is not like a crab they put on here we go all right so salt is really going to help us extract the water out of the out of the uh the mushroom okay we're gonna do that all right we're looking good so far all right now we're gonna put the garlic release a little bit of fragrance in the garlic and we're gonna start to put a little bit of uh you'll see all right so now before we put the the garlic is just going to be there for a few minutes a few seconds got it doesn't need to ground quite the contrary i don't want it to brown some channel do that i don't do that i don't like the brown garlic i like it to be very delicate we're gonna put a little bit of flour in here now and then we're gonna start adding some liquid okay so a little bit of flour if we have a lot of liquid you've seen how i do it i put my strainer in the liquid and i introduce it that's a good way to do it but if we don't have any liquid then we gotta have another way to do it and the best way to do it is to take your flour and introduce it gently with a strainer you see introduce it gently with a strainer so you don't have big lumps okay all right so we're gonna do that we're gonna introduce it to the dish one mushroom came out okay so now you have to be careful of two things now one the flour could attach in the bottom so now we're going to put a little bit of wine if we don't do wine we're going to do a little stock if we don't do wine we do a little stock you got to put some liquid now otherwise you know what's going to happen right it's going to stick in the bottom all right so now we are again in a mission to clean the bottom of our pot to make sure it doesn't stick and you feel it that's why i like to use the wooden spoon for that prince i can feel the bottom of my pot feel the bottom of your pot you see all right really important and we're doing two two things at one time we are now reducing our wine you see reducing one the minute you put wine folks and you're gonna cook for a while you gotta reduce it you gotta get rid of all that alcohol to reduce the wine okay how much wine did i put in what do you think half a bottle there you go a little more and the rest is for me okay now we're going to bring it to boil and we're going to let it reduce it's doing so many things right now first we're doing really good introducing the flour that's number one number two uh we are getting rid of the alcohol bring it to boil and the garlic is gonna start releasing its delicate fragrance all right so so far we're doing really good we haven't put any stock yet if you're not drinking wine you can just add stock but remember now don't forget scrape the bottom of the pot friends i know it's gonna stick okay you wanna i like to keep my pot clean in the bottom not because it's easier to clean of course it is easier to clean but most important let me put it in the middle my most important because i don't want any burnt bits trust me you're cooking for two and a half hours i don't care how slow you are if you have burned bits in the bottom of the pot then you're gonna test them that's gonna test burn and i hate that it's terrible terrible terrible all right so we're looking good we're starting to look beautiful now we're gonna put a little bit of stock for those of you that have followed my video on the stock folks this is my beautiful bee stock look at gold your studies you see look at this it's gorgeous all right so now i'm gonna take it and i'm gonna put my stock in here i'm putting about um too late all of it yeah it's an eight ounce little uh i like extra sauce extra juice okay it's really up to you my friends whether you put in there or not okay so now we're looking good we're looking really good i'm tired the smell of it is amazing my friend i'm gonna put some peppers i'm gonna put a little more salt because i don't have enough salt here just a little bit of some more salt i'm going to reduce the heat i don't need it to be so high anymore now right and then i'm going to put my carrots now those guys are going to take a long time to cook trust me they're like there's mamma mia and the celery and everything is big is everything is sliced big all right we're gonna put this in there like this you see it's looking good it's looking good now tonight i'm going to serve it with today i'm going to serve with papadela pasta but you can also serve with the little potatoes you know there's a little potato in there put them in there they'll be perfectly fine they'll cook perfectly fine all right let's put them in there wash them and put them in there to be great i think i'm going to put just a little bit more stock so that'll be about three cups of stock and then we're going to take a beautiful hunk of meat right there my friends and oh oh mamma mia look see i always forget something it wouldn't be the right channel if if i didn't forget something i gotta forgot something every time look i have time and and and uh and rosemary use sage it's wonderful also in there if you don't have fresh herbs you want to use dry herbs there's nothing wrong with it if you don't have them right if you don't have them you don't have it what are you going to do use dry herbs but be careful use less they're more intense okay in the volume of it so be careful no use less okay so we're not gonna oh worcestershire sauce you don't have to put worcestershire sauce in there it's just great wonderful unami flavor there just an extra flavor different layers of flavor very little of it i promise you it really it gives it a new shape generously yeah i don't know what it is can't describe it but trust me it's it'll a good good in there just a little bit worcestershire sauce worcestershire and look at this my friends so now remember we're braising this right braising means in liquid you know i do a filament like that amazing yeah absolutely amazing my friends right there so now you got two choices to cook this cook it on the stove very slowly bring it to a bloop bloop bloop bloop now don't go any crazy you know right you can do that or you can put a cover on it and pop it in the oven in the oven it's going to take longer you cook it at three and a quarter 350 fahrenheit and keep an eye on it uh for you know take about three four hours as well okay on the stove it might take a little bit less time we're gonna see i'm gonna show you when it's ready it's ready when it falls apart you know you can actually put it with a fork on it that's when it's ready and you can serve with mashed potatoes you can serve with a potato in it you can say with pasta like my mom used to do whatever you do i know you're gonna love it we're gonna bring it to boil we're gonna cook it slowly and when it's done we're going to serve it all right so we'll be back in um however long it's going to take i would say a good two and a half three hours okay we'll be back okay friends well that took forever to cook i mean we're talking about three and a half four hours folks do me a favor put it in the oven much easier than putting on the stove on a stove it's very labor intensive you gotta constantly mix it it's gonna stick you know and you gotta cook it slowly put it in the oven then you don't worry about it one every hour once in a while you check it and you make sure and what you're looking for is it's falling apart you you're looking for the meat to fall apart my friends you see you're looking for the meat to fall apart look at this you see right here it's falling apart that's all we're looking for okay i'll show you i've taken two fork and that's the idea that's what we're looking for here friends you see look look you want to make sure you see it falls apart that you know what i'm going to do friends i'm going to take it i'm going to put it on on the cutting board so we can all look together okay because that's really the only way you'll see my friends we're going to take it right here and you see look look you see this is what we're looking for here friends you see right there it's falling apart look at this let me tell you and the meat right there my friends the flavor oh let me tell you this is fabulous so what my mom used to do they said take the meat like that right and shred it all and put it and mix it with a pasta and give it to us with a sauce and a pasta and let me tell you that was really something my friends all right so let me turn this off we don't need it to go anymore i got some papadala pasta which is just a this just do it with rice dirty with mashed potatoes do it with whatever you want papadela pasta is a papa papadela pasta is a large fettuccine okay and uh and they're wonderful and what i like to do is just put them in a in a boiling water which is not boiling that much right now but it's supposed to be boiling and uh and and then i what i do is i i dry them i put them with a little butter because we can never have too much butter and uh and remember at the last minute friends sprinkle it up on the parsley you know give it some more brightness because after that many hours of cooking your vegetables and i've lost their their their punch if you will their brightness because they cook so long right so what we're going to do we're going to put a roboto in there and then we're going to take this pasta is oh it's hot it's hot oh yeah it's hot and we're gonna put it in here and just mix it up with a raw butter and a little bit of parmigiano reggiano that's all we do very simple my friend you do this with mashed potatoes oh man something is hot on my hand this is it mashed potatoes also it's wonderful okay but very simple right a little salt and pepper very little salt because you already got it in there see little salt and pepper a little parmigiano-reggiano on the pasta you can certainly skip that if you don't want the parmigiano region but i think you should want it it's delicious right and you know what let's make the pasta even a little more pretty right there let's turn the heat off i don't need no more heat i love it beautiful pasta with just a little bit of butter and a little bit of parmigiano reggiano that's all very simple you see okay come back over here you you see and i love it when it's just plain like that my friends very simple and now we're going to take this meat right there my friends and it's right there you see you can mix it up my mom used to put it in a big pot and mix everything so it was it was beautiful right and then we take it a ladle and we pour some of that beautiful sauce right here my friend you see we take some of the vegetables right there and we put some of the carrots that are perfectly cooked you see and some of the mushroom and some of the garlic right there and we take another piece of meat and we put it right on top and voila and voila hold on hold on i made a mess out of my cutting board so now and then what i like to do is a reminder i like to remind everybody what herbs i have in there so i have some thyme and i have a little bit of rosemary so i like to remind them so then when they get the dish they expect those two flavors and this is it my friend a touch more parsley right there and since we're among friends if you don't mind i'm gonna take a bite out of this it's too much i'm gonna have to take taking before look at it it falls apart completely oh melts in my mouth my friend but now remember leave it in the oven three four hours until you can do what i just did with a fork that's all you have to do my friends i hope you enjoyed remember thumbs up if you liked the video don't forget to subscribe to the channel and ring that bell we see you in the next couple of days with another fantastic video

the perfect pan seared steak it's actually not penciled all the way it's penciled and then we'll pop it in the oven because it's too thick to cook in a pan you know in a rule of thumb i always say if something is uh is about an inch and a half like this you couldn't really cook it in the fry pan you'll end up over cooking in the outside in order to cook the inside so you want to pencil it and just pop it in a water in a hot hot hot oven my oven is set at 500 degrees so i'm gonna cook it really really quick we're gonna say maybe four or five minutes depends how you like to cook right but i'm going to show you how to make a beautiful pen sauce and we're going to make a sticker puebla with a peppercorn sauce i'm going to show you how to do it it's very simple right we have our sticks and uh we got a fry pan going over there we're going to put a little bit of uh olive oil you can't cook steak and butter remember now you see people cooking steak in butter your butter will burn before your um uh your your meat or your chicken or your fish whatever you're cooking is cooked because milk uh a butter has milk milk has protein and they burn at 250 degrees so you can't really cook anything about it you get most out of the butter if you put it at the end that's all we're going to do we're going to put in the sauce so i want to make sure that my pan is hot and i'm looking at 350 375 okay i'll make sure my pan is super super hot i got a stainless steel pan so it's oven proof and we're going to pop it in the oven and we're going to finish it by making a nice pencil so we're going to serve it with a potato grater and a buttered green beans very simple dish okay for the potato gratin uh we'll give you a link for the recipe for the potato grated and they're right there they're ready to go and this is very simple to do we're using a green peppercorn green peppercorn and what's the difference between a green peppercorn and a black peppercorn yeah i can hear the smile alec over there saying oh it's there one is green when it's black it's the same uh uh berry it's from the pepper tree the green peppercorn i put into a brine and the black pepper corn are roasted so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna prepare the steak and we're going to put heavy heavy duty peppercorn okay i'm talking about really really really heavy peppercorn let me just slow down on the heat for a second i'm talking about friends very very very heavy peppercorn okay this is cracked black pepper mediterranean sea salt you want to put less pepper in there you'll go ahead and put less pepper and it's your steaks okay but i like to put a lot of pepper in there i really really like to put a lot of peppers so we'll put a lot of pepper in there okay and don't be afraid it's a peppercorn steak yeah remember also one thing is the pepper when you cook it it gets milder it gets really really my roasted black pepper i mean you can still test you want to test it and um so mediterranean sea salt floral cell celery which i want to make you happy all right let's check it to make sure we have the right temperature in our pan we're not quite there because i slowed it down a little bit i didn't want to not be ready okay and we are going in in the oven in a second i want to put them in a pan i'm going to show you how to make the perfect steak by the way this is new york strip i removed some of the fat because it was too much fat on top of it you keep it in there if you want to sometimes you go to the butcher shop and man they give you like a thick little fat and if you like fat then you go right ahead remember now the secret friends of having a perfectly pen steel steak is very simple the minute you put it in the pan you do not touch it anymore until you're ready to flip it so you put it in don't touch it don't do nothing don't touch it everybody wants to play with it right have you noticed that everybody wants to play with it we're going to leave it in there let me get my wet towel we're going to it in there for a second and we do not want to touch it for at least two three minutes and i'm telling you i mean two or three minutes friends do not touch it don't play with it my oven is 500 i tell you that already the oven has to be preheated 500 see i'm all ready i'm all ready to go i just like it clean my uh is it now see that's when everybody wants to oh let me play with it no don't touch it have you ever noticed you put something on the grill right let's say for chicken let's say you put steak on the grill and uh and and a minute later you say oh let me play with it guess what happened it sticks right leave it alone for three minutes then you touch it the protein will release themselves but it's not gonna stick the secret is not to touch it not to play with it like everybody wants to do they constantly want to play with it so let me tell you what we're going to do okay we're going to in in a minute and a half from now i don't know i'm not looking at the time but we'll see it we're going gonna flip it on the other side and we're gonna take the whole pan and we're gonna pop it in the oven we're gonna leave it in there i don't know it's pretty thick four minutes five minutes we're not really gonna pay attention to the time too much we're gonna check temperature depends how you like it cook 130 135 medium rare or rare okay 125 for rare but let's say 130 35 get yourself a good thermometer okay and uh you know get yourself a good thermometer there's a bunch of thermometer we use this is really good it's called a thermapen i believe thermapen yeah it's really good it's expensive but it's good polder makes a really good thermometer instant read thermometer it really good so now what do you think do you think it's been about two and a half three minutes well we're gonna find out okay because i want it to be really pretty i'm what i'll tell you this is the prettiest steak look look look check it out look how gorgeous that is look at this look at this friends is that beautiful or is that beautiful that friends is a perfectly fancy steak opuama peppercorn we're not going to take it and we're going to go to the oven all right we're going to go in the oven and and then we're going to make the pan sauce in the pan because i'll have some mala reaction in the bottom of the pan and have some fond in the bottom of the pan then i can deglaze with cognac while the steak are resting i'm going to make a pencil so everybody can do this kind of like what you need though kind of like what you need what kind of english is that you're going to need a little bit of a beef stock now this is a beef stock that we make of course because we have a commercial kitchen so it's easy for us to do it right but it's um if you don't have a commercial of course if you don't have a commercial kitchen not everybody got a commercial kitchen but what you do you make a beef broth or you buy a beef broth and you add some tomato paste to it and if you have some extra leeks carrot celery and onion put it in a pot with your tomato paste and you beef broth then you bought already right watch for sodium right and then cook it for a while and look look see how beautiful that is that's going to be super easy to make a beautiful sauce with it all right so the green beans they're already poached remember when you cook uh most vegetables green beans um broccoli you wanna blanch them first you can't take a green beans and saute in a pan right so you want to blend them first blanch means just sautee them a little bit in advance well now we're going to take some butter wait wait we're going to use the butter don't worry see look at that everybody's always asking me why do you have such a big thing about her right why do i have such a big thing about it it's a mental support so look friends green beans are sauteed already right all i'm gonna do now i mean they cooked already all i'm gonna do is i'm just saute them in butter really simple they already cooked right so what i'm doing now is i'm coating them with so i'm going to put some floral cell on top of it just use a good mediterranean sea salt if you don't have floral cell a little bit of black pepper but little because because the um the stick is going to have a lot of that in there already right we're just going to saute them nice and pretty they cook remember there's a butter you could you can add some shout outs to it i got some right here look we're gonna add a little bit of sugar so you can cook them a little bit right while the steak is in the oven we'll cook a little bit of shallots a little green beans right there delicious simple you know what i do is i uh when i do the green beans i cut the ends then it's attached to the to the plant and i keep this it's it's kind of cute right what do you think i like when i ask you what you think or you you tell me in um in the um in the comments hey don't forget to subscribe okay we need some subscriber we just relaunched this youtube channel and there's a lot of cool videos out there we taped a lot of video uh the last couple of weeks so we have a lot of them we're gonna try to come out at least with one a week we're gonna try okay it's a lot of work folks but uh we like it so look we got these uh beautiful green beans we're gonna leave them here for a second my green peppercorn i open up you buy them in a jar okay in a jar in a can green peppercorn that's the way they come like that and what i do is i drain them out of there because it comes in a brine and it's usually salt water you know that brine is just salt water and maybe some citric acid or something i'm not really sure what the hell they got yeah yeah look green peppercorn water salt and citric acid that's usually how they and then i drain that and then i put it in a type of wet container and i replace the water with cognac so so and then i keep it in my fridge i don't know if you've ever used it uh green peppercorn but the traditional in classical french cuisine we use it a lot in in dishes and that's the typical that's a classical second problem i'm going to show you it's really simple right it's really simple to make i'm gonna make it i have totally demystified the whole recipe to make it simple but this is gonna be a crucial ingredient for you okay what we're gonna do we're gonna deglaze the panda who's coming out of the oven in a minute while the steaks are resting and we're going to deglaze it with a cognac and then we're going to put a stock and we're going to put a little bit of cream just a touch of cream in there and then we're going to finish it up with butter yeah you got our butter butter oh baby no margarine you know margarine is the molecule away from acrylic you like plastic yeah you eat your margarine yeah yeah eat your margarine i'll eat my butter thank you very much okay what do you think the steaks are gonna be ready you know what we're gonna do we're gonna check them let's check them it's gonna be smoky in there you watch whoo i'll tell you what i'll tell you now be careful when you're taking the pan out of the fry out of the oven always keep a rag on it because you know it's hot right when you take it out but then you're going to do something and you're going to forget the pen there you're going to want to move it you know in a commercial kitchen it's a rule you take something out of the oven you leave the towel on okay so depends how you like you stay cooked this feels pretty good to me it feels about medium rare rare and that's the way i like mine so i'm gonna take them out okay and i'm gonna let them rest oh yeah look look at beautiful daddy you see if you could be here and smell them we got to let them rest it's very important it doesn't matter what recipe we're making we are letting them rest and now what i'm going to do friends i am going to get rid of the extra oil right there the extra oil and the fat you can keep it in there if you want i rather replace that fat with butter because it'll give me consistency will it bring me creaminess trust me i like better that way you do however you want to do it but this is a simple preparation for this is no big deal okay anybody can do this all right so now we're going to get the pen super hot that's not not that it's not hot already it's pretty hot right and then we're going to flambe it no

ingredients that   we're going to need for our beef stew okay so here . i have one and a half to two pounds of stew meat   and you can definitely use like some chuck roast . kind of a tougher cut of meat is fine to use here   or of course you can use like any kind of cut up . steak or more tender kind of meat as well and then   i have some onions and i'm gonna be using some . carrots and this is some celery and you can use   the leaves here i have you know the ribs of celery . and then along with like some cut up leaves that   gives it a ton of flavor here too then of course i . have some garlic and these are russet potatoes and   i have just them in some water here so they don't . turn brown while i'm waiting for my things to cook   and i'll just drain that water off when i add them . and then i also have some fresh thyme and for this   recipe you can use fresh thyme you can use dried . thyme you could even use like an italian seasoning   blend okay so to get the beef stew started what . i'm going to do is add in a few tablespoons here   of flour and if you have somebody in your family . who is gluten intolerant then you can definitely   skip this step and then add some cornstarch a . little bit later in the recipe just to thicken   things up a little bit but i'm going to do a few . tablespoons here for my two pounds of beef and i'm   going pretty heavy on the beef on this one but . you can definitely go a little bit lighter too   okay and then to get started i'm just going to put . a few tablespoons of olive oil into my dutch oven   here and we're going to let . that warm up and to this   meat i'm going to add probably about two teaspoons . of salt we want this to be really well salted and then also we're going to add some pepper in . probably about a teaspoon of pepper maybe a half a   teaspoon pepper and just mix this all in and then . the first thing we're going to do is we're going   to brown our meat here and i'm just going to put . that into the bottom of the pan and you want to   be sure and allow room between the pieces of roast . here and that's so that it has room to caramelize   here we go just add a little bit of that and spread it . around in the bottom of the pan and we'll let   it get brown on each side before we turn it . okay and when you are doing this roast here   when you're browning your meat you can let it get . really brown on the underside before you flip it all right that is just about perfect you . can see it's brown on the underside here all right and then i'm just going to . take it out of the pan here with my tongs and we'll just go in some shifts and   around as much meat as we can at a . time without overcrowding the pan and this is on just a medium high heat so now you can just set that browned meat . aside and to my pan i'm going to add a large   diced onion and then also just about a half a cup . of water and this is going to help the pan deglaze   on the bottom and get all of those nice little . playful bits that are on the bottom of the pan   so you want to bring those up and . cook the onions at the same time   here we go and now we're going to stir these . onions until they become translucent after you   give the onions and a little bit of water or beef . broth a chance to soften the bottom of that pan   it will come up really easily and this one is . actually a great time also to add some red wine   to this a lot of people love red wine in their . beef stew but i prefer just using beef broth there we go now we'll just let these onions . cook until they are translucent and tender   which is about five minutes okay so now . these onions have had a chance to tenderize   just a little bit i'm going to add in . about a tablespoon of minced garlic   and we'll just cook this again . until the garlic is also translucent okay and then into this i'm going to add my celery . and my carrots and just stir that up a little bit and then i'm also going to be adding some . thyme and i need about a tablespoon of thyme   and if you don't have time on hand you can use . some italian herbs that would be fine you can   also use dried herbs that's okay i have fresh . thyme in my fridge so that is definitely going   to give you the most flavor and with time what . you want to do is just grab the end of it and   then you'll gently pull the leaves pulling down . on the stem and it will take the leaves right off   and then i'm just going to use a little . knife here and cut it and also if you   don't want all this thyme in there you could . just put the sprigs in and then take them out   when you take the bay leaves out too but i . just really love all of this thyme flavor okay and now you can put . the beef broth into the stew   and i've got some little bits of my beef . broth in here i'm just going to add those in give this a little stir and i also have . my potatoes i'm going to strain them and add these to my stew and along with my . browned meat and any juices that are in there we are just going to give that a quick stir here we go and i've added quite a . bit of potatoes and beef to mine so   you can definitely add another . cup or two of beef broth to this all right and there's a couple last minute . additions we are going to add in about two   tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and . this is just going to add a ton of depth   to our stew and then also we're going to add . about a half a cup of tomato sauce and you can   add just a scoop of tomato paste if you want but . the little bit of tomato base in this stew recipe   just makes it really rich and gives it a ton . of flavor all right we just have one last thing   and i'm going to add in about four bay leaves . and we will take these out before we serve it   but there we go now we'll just let it cook for . about a half hour and those potatoes will get   nice and tender and the carrots will be tender and . we'll be ready to enjoy our beeps too all right   here is my beef stew and as you can . see here i've just got a few of these   bay leaves in here that i want to take out . before i serve it let's see there's another one there we go okay   and then i'll just give this a quick stir and as . you can see those carrots are really flavorful   and are cooked perfectly that beef is fall apart . tender it looks so good and you can definitely   taste it now and see if it needs maybe just a . little bit more salt or a little bit more pepper   all right and i like to add just a little bit . of fresh parsley on there before i serve it   all right here is my beef stew recipe and this . is just like my mom used to make it's loaded with   beef and then it has this awesome tomato and beef . broth base and i promise you start out with this   recipe you can make all kinds of variations you . could add peas at this point you could add corn at   this point like some frozen corn would be really . good but this is an all-time favorite classic beef   stew recipe that your family is going to love . all right now for the fun part i get to try it oh it is so thick and rich has so much flavor   this is the best way to eat some beef and . potatoes and carrots it is so

d_Sn1lAEmSQ.json;[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel i hope you all are having a fantastic day and someone had requested chinese fried chicken and today's your lucky day we are going to be fixing chinese fried chicken here i have four leg quarters that i washed and prepped i have some soy sauce i have ginger garlic green onions star anise i have some chinese cooking wine and some chinese five spice i also have some white pepper and some sugar let's get started so guys the first thing we'll do is brine the chicken we will do that by adding some sugar and some salt to this chicken and we will let this sit for four to six hours if you can let this sit overnight that will be best you will get the best results if you let this sit in your refrigerator overnight but i don't have the time today so i am allowing it to sit for about four to six hours i'll go and um run a few errands uh cook some fried rice and then i'll get back to the chicken so we let this soak in the sugar and salt all of the ingredients and measurements will be listed down in my description box we let this soak and i'll be back with you guys next we'll add all of our ingredients to this pot with water i have added three cups of water to the pot and now i will add my soy sauce my sugar you know all of the ingredients like i said before everything will be listed in my description box we'll add them here and we will let this boil for about 10 minutes we want all those flavors to just absorb into the water and just be a nice broth for our chicken to parboil in so after about 10 minutes our water should be ready now and what we'll do is add our chicken in here we'll add it in and we will allow the chicken to boil in this water for about 15 to 20 minutes and what we'll do is every five minutes we will baste the chicken with the liquid we'll go in with our spoon and we'll base it you know just to make sure that the um chicken is being really good and submerged in that liquid and we'll let it go for about 15 to 20 minutes and then i'll show you guys the next step after about 20 minutes we will now remove the chicken from the liquid we'll turn our heat off and we'll simply remove the chicken but you have to be very gentle because we don't want to damage the chicken skin okay we want the chicken skin there you know because it's just better to fry the chicken with the skin it's nice and crispy it's also better for presentation purposes so we don't want to damage the skin be very gentle and remove the chicken so here i place my chicken on a draining rack because you want the chicken to drain off and dry a little bit before we start frying it you don't want to place the chicken straight out of the water into the oil it's very very dangerous so we let it drain next we'll go ahead and fry our chicken we will deep fry it in enough oil that the chicken can be submerged in there we'll fry the chicken for about 10 to 15 minutes or at least until you see your chicken starts to look golden brown at this point it should be thoroughly cooked because we parboil the chicken first so once your chicken starts to look golden brown you will remove the chicken from the oil and proceed with frying the rest of the chicken you can allow your chicken to get as brown or as light as you like it is your choice so now we'll continue the same process until we are all done and once you're all done guys this is how your chicken should be looking nice yummy and delicious now i'll plate this up and i'll show you guys the finished product okay guys so this is my take on a delicious chinese fried chicken whoever asked for the recipe i hope it met all of your expectations if you follow the steps you should end up with something amazing it's crispy on the outside soft moist and juicy on the inside i will be pairing mine up with some fried rice but you can have yours with whatever you like i do hope you guys enjoy the video if you did give it a thumbs up share it leave a comment down below and don't forget guys hit the subscribe button for me i will be leaving all my ingredients and measurements down in the description box and i'll see you guys in my next video enjoy [Music] you;['segundos']

and I got a ground short ribs you can use um 80 20. uh ground beef then you buy the grocery store so I got I started with the onion I got a big onion I'll tell you when I made it big onion I made a big onion look at ammonium I'm using beautiful Spanish uh yellow onion look look we're gonna put the ground beef in here friends then I'll tell you about everything I said I'm just going to saute that to create that nice Maya reaction to get some brownie that's so important friends I see people making chilies they stew the beef they stew it don't ever stew it you wanna um uh so dead he got a beautiful golden brown and I'm going to do the same thing with the sausage and as I say we're going to put a little bit of the uh uh the um a garlic olive oil you know just a little bit and we're going to Brown this and this right here the onion we're going and we're gonna get some nice caramelization plants you see very important friends they will get some nice caramelization otherwise it'll be like stew and the sausage I'm gonna break it up this my friends is the most important thing you can do right there right there I buy a spicy Italian sausage sausage um most good Italian Market will ever but most grocery store have it um I'm not so sure I want to buy the regular grocery store but uh if you have an Italian Market in your neighborhood they're usually pretty good with this so we're gonna Brown the meat we're gonna burn the meat because uh that create that Maya reaction I was telling you about and that's key they make a good chili friends then we're gonna have some beans we're gonna put some cannellini beans some kidney beans some red beans and then we're gonna get this golden brown now this is very spicy already but I'm still gonna put some uh I got a secret ingredient not secret anymore now because I'll tell you you guys are the best you know let me tell you I tell all my friends that I chef than a retire or a better retired say you know you've been cooking for 30 40 50 years there's so many chefs and I've been doing this their whole life I said it's time for you to share all that knowledge then you have acquired with a YouTube start your own channel and uh and a lot of them are gonna do be doing it I'm inviting every Chef I did there is a professional chef style your own YouTube channel people want to learn what you got in your head and you'll want to share it with everybody it's amazing when you think about the platform right so look the most important thing you want to do and you see so many people violate that don't let them caramelize the meat all right friends it's gonna take me a few minutes because this I really want to do it right so I'm gonna do it let me talk real quick about the ingredient I don't want to miss it I got celery cut very small carrots small Boon ones tomato puree fresh thyme cumin little chili paste powder cilantro or parsley and I got a hot a chili pepper garlic and my dear friends you can get it in the can it's a Chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce oh that stuff my friends it's so hot you have to be careful this is a can right there I used a little bit I mostly use the Adobo sauce and uh just a couple of spoon of this is enough this is enough for the whole church okay if you're gonna cook for the whole church you're going to use the whole thing but you need at least three 400 people okay you can never use the whole can I always forget about it nobody's going to eat it no no I promise you nobody's gonna eat it because it's gonna be too hot we want a spicy but delicate okay now see we don't have any color yet then I got the beans right there I'm using the uh the Goya bean I love Goya bean I think they do a fabulous job because they're still very firm years ago I would have never thought of using a can in a in a I mean a bean in the can because they were mushy today I don't know how they did it but they know how to do it correctly and uh and I joined them sometimes I use a little bit of that water because it's a nice starchy water but sometime I don't I got some tomato in there I got a 28 ounce can of uh tomatoes and uh so I'm gonna put all this together and let me continue sorting this for a minute my friends oh I got a little brown sugar also to have said if we have a little bit of acidity from from the tomatoes just a little bit sometime because they're not going to cook that long um if we have a little bit of acidity then the brown sugar is going to help us on the brown sugar it's a dark brown sugar it's not as um not a sweet that's regular sugar I wanted to show you real quick folks you see right here this is what I'm looking for right there see right there I hope Jack can show them right there I'm sure you can see it you see this is what we're looking for right here folks see I'm looking for the caramelization right there I don't care what you do yeah okay anything you do you're using ground meat or ground sausage friends you gotta get the Maya reaction okay really really important oh yeah baby this is gonna be delicious how are we doing here we're doing good it's starting over here all right I continue doing this I'll be back in a couple of minutes when it's all done okay okay friends see it took a few moments I want to show you see right there friends this is what you're looking for okay that colonization it's a mustard it's a must-have now the beef didn't caramelize as much we stay we still we got some nice flavor we got some nice gum not as much because what happened is then the pot is stolen some of the moisture stays on top of it you see in the fry pan so if you're gonna caramelize something you're doing it perfect do it in a fry pan instead of doing it in a in a pot okay so you see right there much much better right okay so now we're gonna take some uh some of the carrots I'm gonna take some of the celery some of it about the whole thing not that big of a deal just a little container in here I'm not sure how many ounces that is but we're gonna mix all this up this is very simple recipe my friends it's simple the a little prep that's all remember break down the cake the carrot the carrot break down the carrot sometimes I wonder about myself break down the the sausages you don't want a big piece of sausage you want it to be crumbed crumble see right there beautiful beautiful all right here we go put it all in there now you see now of course can you do it in one part yeah you can do the whole thing in one part maybe nothing wrong with that nothing wrong doing it in one part friends nothing wrong with doing it all in one part just takes a little longer that's all and uh and and for the purpose of this video I don't want it to be too long all right so now we're gonna put a little bit of tomato puree there's a little bit of tomato puree I'm gonna cook this just for a second yeah and then we're gonna put a 28 ounces of the tomatoes and what I did I squeezed them I squeeze them in my hands yeah I squeeze them all right now let's put some flavoring in there friends all right let's not forget nothing usually I'm always forgetting something I could have put the garlic a few minutes ago this is a lot of garlic it looks like it but it's not that much you want a nice big healthy tablespoon of garlic I should have put it just a little earlier earlier I make mistakes so I can explain it um a little bit of the chili pepper you can pass you can skip this if you don't want it uh a little bit of a parsley or cilantro the chili powder so remember this is a matter of opinion how hot do you want it cumin cumin cumin is some magic about cumin it really is and then um a fresh Time Fresh time fresh Time Fresh time very important my friends the fresh timer and now now my friends we are going to put our uh chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce be careful with this thing just like look one two oh that's enough I mean I like a little spicy deep but the the smokiness the flavor then the Adobe the uh chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce give you my friends oh my Lord this is heaven this is really heaven so I have a little bit of the beef stock that I'm gonna put just a little bit of the beef stock I don't want to put too much yet I can always add more okay I can always add more my friends but I think that's going to be enough right there now we're gonna put the beans so cannellini beans if you don't like beans it's not a recipe for you there are red beans right there friends and this is a a white kidney beans and we'll decide in a minute we're gonna decide in a minute friends if we are indeed going to put some of that water from the beans I love a lot of beans so I hope you like beans too that's a lot of beans I love it to me this is like a an amazing chili you can also add some bacon in there too you can saute some bacon and add it to it and now what we're gonna do friends we're gonna cook this slowly and it's going to release more liquid we're gonna cook it slowly for about uh 30 minutes and we're going to see what happened so we're going to do it very slowly and then we'll adjust the seasoning of it and uh we're gonna have a self an amazing chili so I'll be back in a few minutes when this is nicely cooked down and we're testing and we'll adjust it accordingly be back in a few minutes okay friends 45 minutes perfect timing and look at look how beautiful that looks it's gonna be delicious so you can sprinkle a little bit of parsley in here to give you or the or a cilantro whichever one you want to put just to give you some nice fresh bright color to it I added some of the water from the beans one of them uh it's up to you how much liquid you put in it all depends how thick you want it you see and uh and there's my friends looks absolutely gorgeous you see this is perfect now so far I've not missed my uh serving Bowl and uh now there's I have to say six million ways to serve that obviously and what I like to do friends I'll take a little bit of the sour cream and I mix it with uh uh with a little bit of heavy whipping cream and uh and I'm just gonna put a little bit of it just just a little bit just like this just like this right just a little bit and then I'm going to put uh a little more sour cream in the middle and they can put it with a ice cream scoop that I forgot to take a uh a small one I don't want to take a big big one I put an ice cream scoop

promised you friends it's going to be amazing I promise you it's going to be amazing and and I like the sour cream because it cuts down a little bit of the heat from it just enough you see and this is going to be hot so be careful don't burn yourself you may have to wait a little bit oh oh you know what I love the most about um oh I'm gonna eat that whole thing what I love the most about is a

EfXyVh8wT2c.json;today we're going to show you a really amazing slow-cooked beef cheeks recipe so soft then it falls apart with just a touch of a fork so this is what you need onion you can use any color you up a carrot you actually do me two celery stalks I don't have but okay I like celery for clip four cloves garlic I'm using three beef cheeks because they're fairly big but you can like use six small ones or big ones I guess kind of depends on how many so they'll probably eat this and all all right so first thing do is this my carrot shave it on down you're just gonna dice it up for me I like to usually cut it in half and then in half again I can do more fine dice I like my great uncle so there is the carrot done next we're going to dice up the onion I have few tricks up now I do this first you gotta peel the skin off so what I do is cut the onion in half like this then you push down on the top like that if you prefer and cut a few just fight those alone like that find one more and then you do wipe away those tears it'll all be worth all be worth it in the end next thing you gotta do is just check your beep cheek like you want to cut off any like really fatty bits I mean leave some of it but um you know what too much fat I like to cut off anything that's going to like feel really top in your mouth so like if anything feels really gritty this is a really hard fit you want to make sure your knife is really sharp when you're cutting into me because you don't want to like chop it up and make it this that I'm using is grab you that's why it's so marbled like that I'm just you know feel around if there's anything that feels extra tough cut it right off a lot of people don't do this and you really should so we have to see your offer meet but I'm going to do that you really want to make sure you're it's nice and dry so get a paper towel and just like dry off each of the needs so that when you stick the salt on it and you sear it off it doesn't have any of that water or liquid on it and you can get really nice sear but this is an important step when you're cooking anything that you're going to sear off in the pan so if you're making a nice steak for dinner make sure you just pat down your meat with paper towel and get off some excess liquid that way that nice crispy outside and really tender meat in the middle now when you're seasoning you want to make sure that you coat each side of your meat with plenty of salt and pepper what I like to do is spread it on like this and then Pat it in to make sure the salt is getting right into the meat away when you sear it doesn't fall off so what you're going to do is just see your bowl slides of the night when you're scaring me want to make sure that your temperature on your burner is up high that way right when you put your meat in the pan it starts to sizzle the other thing to note is to make sure you do not crowd your pan because then your meat is not going to get a nice even sear see that nice bit of crispy Brown sear that is beautiful that's what we want to see also remember when you're searing off any kind of meat they do tend to shrink so whatever you start off with originally it's not going to be what you end up with that's a nice here we'll pull these out get ready to saute our pennies now we're going to come back over to the pan which I've taken off the heat added some olive oil to my pan is really hot so I didn't want to burn my veggies when I was putting it in I'm just going to stir these around make sure we can get to nice and mixed in with the olive oil oops there goes an onion flying up into the great beyond now I'm using a garlic press for my garlic because I don't like to take the time to chop it up so here I go I don't like to put it directly on the pan so sometimes I like to make a little bit of vegetable so that I don't burn small bits of garlic when I'm putting it in and then I'm going to stir it up and it'll all get incorporated you know it's ready when you get that nice smell of garlic and your onions are translucent and soft so we're going to turn our burner down so we're going to add some wine to this but first what we do is we're bringing our maybe mentally over to the slow cooker putting it on there and then we're going to bring our meat over and stick it on top of I'm just going to lay our beef cheese on top look at that knife here the next thing we do is my favorite part the one now this recipe because it's going to be the slow cooker needs kind of a punchy like full big red wine so like caps off we're low would work glue white caps having this also that's what I'm using some yellowtail doesn't need to be that nice of wine like I wouldn't use more than $20 bottle do this anyway so you're going to do two cups of red wine now we're going to bring that delicious red wine over to the pan try not to take a sip when you're walking over I know it's tempting but it is 2:30 in the morning for me make sure you scrape down the bottom of your pan so you're getting all those that's absurd meat and vegetables off the bottom giving it that extra bit of flavor then we're going to bring it up to high heat and make it to simmer get the bubbles so after you let it simmer for about a minute take it off the heat bring it over and give your me a nice line back get in my belly next you're going to add just the remaining ingredients so this is enough of beef stock fish put that right on top does it need to be heated just to add more flavor then you're going to get these you can get fresh thyme so it's like your fresh thyme sprigs you could do like four or five sprigs of it I was not thinking ahead enough so I didn't get any fresh it's always better to use fresh but today we're dry so you're going to add a tablespoon and a half that's over half and then you're gonna if you have fresh bay leaves I would only add three because they're a little more potent but I'm using dried again so I'm going to add four because they're just a little less hope then fresh bay leaf so one two three now what I usually do for the crock pot is you have to tie on high and half the time on low it's really up to you like for this recipe can do 10 hours on low or eight hours on high but I can't do half and half so I'll do about eight hours but they for on high and then for low so then you just say slow cooker then check it in about nine hours I like to cut like I said come back in about four and then turn the temperature on so low and then I'm going to make some really nice creamy mashed potatoes on a stove and roast some asparagus in the oven make a really nice salty crispy asparagus that's about it all right now we're back about eight hours like I said I did at about four hours on high and four hours ago I checked my feet size beef cheek beef cheeks and they're really tender code when I pull them out now it's going to be really soft and then we're going to make gravy mmm see look at that like falling apart barely wants to stay together I'm so slow cookers they have a saute flesh here button find us not everyone does so if yours doesn't you'll just need to do this in a sauce pan on a stove what I'm doing is getting an immersion blender like a stick blender and I'm going to puree the crazy in the drip tonight sides are crispy roasted asparagus in the oven and mashed potatoes but first you want to check your gravy and if it's not at the right consistency and it's not thick enough add a little bit of cornstarch and kind of make it whatever consistency you like your gravy to be as for my mashed potatoes I like to add some sour cream and milk and really blend them well coz I like my potatoes really smooth so I'm just using my immersion blender again to make them the consistency that I like I have made some mashed potatoes and some crispy asparagus in the oven and I'm going to get the plate together and it's gone beautiful thanks guys for watching this video I sure did enjoy eating it with my hubs if you try it yourself I would love to hear how you put in the comments below till next time this is Abbi I can't wait to eat with you again;['segundos']
eKu4w1TIFeg.json;made with guinness beer tender root vegetables and chunks of hearty meat this irish stew is rich delicious and super easy to make hey everybody kristen here as someone who suffers from a chronic disease i believe homemade is best but it doesn't need to be complicated i had several requests the past couple weeks to share with you a recipe for st patrick's day and while i have a delicious instant pot corned beef and cabbage recipe that you can get by clicking the link above i felt like it was high time this irish girl share with you more irish recipes so that's exactly what we're going to do today i'm going to show you how to make a delicious irish inspired stew so let's get cooking to start this recipe we're gonna hit saute on our instant pot and add in a little bit of oil we're gonna let our oil heat while we season up our meat now it's traditional in irish stews to use lamb stew meat however it's a lot easier for me to find beef and it's a lot more affordable even with the prices of beef going sky high right now i have a little over a pound of meat here that i'm patting dry with a paper towel that way our meat can get nice and golden brown when it sears and then i'm going to season generously with salt and pepper once the oil is heated i'm going to add my seasoned meat right to my inner pot just in a nice even layer there we're going to sear that for just a couple minutes on each side just until it's golden brown it doesn't need to be perfect my meat looks nice and golden and so i'm going to remove it now to a plate to our inner pot we're going to saute some onions and garlic and celery and really build the flavors of this stew now it's a little hard to see in my instant pot right now but i still have a little bit of oil and some fat that's rendered from the stew meat if you didn't you would want to add just a little bit more oil right now to my inner pot i'm adding in one small minced onion and one stalk of celery that's been finely minced we're going to saute that up just for a couple minutes until our onion begins to soften now the celery is totally not traditional in my classic beef stew but i really like the celery in this stew because it adds a nice bright fresh flavor that's going to counteract with some of the bitterness of the beer that we're going to add here in just a little bit that's looking good now and so i'm going to add in two tablespoons of tomato paste one tablespoon of minced garlic which is about three cloves of minced garlic and one teaspoon of dried thyme i'm just going to saute that just for 30 seconds to a minute just to toast the tomato paste and bring out its richness and to of course toast the garlic in time as well but we don't want our garlic to burn that'll ruin a dish really fast and now you know the drill we must deglaze our pan to get up all those brown bits on the bottom of our inner pot and there's a lot of them today so for my thin liquid today i'm adding a 12 ounce bottle of guinness beer extra stout guinness beer and then i'm just gonna scrape scrape scrape get up all those brown bits really make sure to get all the bottom of the inner pot and now we're just gonna let that simmer for a couple minutes to slightly reduce and really develop its flavor typically i tell you that if you don't drink alcohol you can substitute the beer or wine in a recipe with additional stock for this irish stew i really really do recommend a stout beer it's going to give this irish stew all of its flavor the beer has tones of coffee and caramel and just so much rich flavor that to make this stew using only beef broth won't impart the same results now we want to hit cancel on our instant pot to turn off the saute function after our dentist has simmered for a couple minutes and to the inner pot i'm adding in two and a half cups of low sodium beef broth now if you like a thicker stew i recommend only using two cups of beef broth we like our stew a little bit on the thinner side so i'm using a full two and a half cups to further season this braising liquid i'm adding in one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and one tablespoon of maple syrup the maple syrup may sound like an odd addition but we need a little sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes and the bitterness of the beer and the maple syrup pairs beautifully with the stout beer the notes are very similar you can certainly use honey or granulated sugar but for the best flavor i do recommend using pure maple syrup also adding in two bay leaves about a teaspoon of salt you can certainly reduce that salt to just a half a teaspoon if you need to watch your sodium and finally we need to add in our seared meat back to the inner pot now that's it for right now we're going to cook our meat first so that we can add our vegetables later so they don't get mushy nobody wants mushy vegetables so we're going to pop our lid on our instant pot we're going to make sure our vent knob is pointed towards sealed and then we're going to set the cooking time for 30 minutes on high pressure don't be tempted to use the stew button we want to be in control of the cooking time ourselves so that we can guarantee great results so you're gonna hit manual or pressure cook and then use the plus or minus buttons to adjust until the time reads 30 minutes while the meat is cooking let's use this time to prep our veggies i have two parsnips and two carrots that i'm peeling and then chopping into one-inch chunks parsnips are traditional in irish stew and they have a nice sweet earthy flavor sort of like a mild carrot if you don't have parsnips or you can't find them or you just don't want to use them you can certainly use an additional two carrots now for the potatoes you can use russet you can use yukon gold you can even use red potatoes i have baby yellow potatoes today and you want to make sure your potatoes are in larger bite sized pieces like one to one and a half chunk sizes if your baby potatoes are on the larger side you want to cut them in half and the smaller ones you can leave whole now once the cooking time has elapsed it is really important to let pressure release on its own for at least 15 minutes so that our meat stays tender once pressure has been released you can open up your instant pot we're gonna add in our veggies i have those carrots that i chopped and the parsnips and i have about one pound of baby potatoes that i'm adding we're gonna pop our lid back on our instant pot make sure your vent knob is sealed if you happen to do a release of pressure after 15 minutes and then we're going to set our cooking time for only three minutes on high pressure three minutes is all you need to get those vegetables tender and our beef to finish cooking once the cooking time has elapsed you must let pressure release naturally for 15 minutes again that way the meat stays tender and the vegetables finish cooking through then you can open up your instant pot smells so so good in here it almost smells a little bit like coffee i'm telling you i wish you guys could smell it now at this point your stew is completely ready to serve and it's just the way my family likes it however if you like stew on a thicker side what you would want to do right now is you would want to turn your instant pot back to saute and let the stew come to a bubble only take a minute and then you want to mix together one tablespoon of cornstarch with one tablespoon of water until the cornstarch is dissolved add that to your inner pot whisk it in and let your stew bubble until it thickens it shouldn't take that long but i'm ready to dish this up right now going for a bite just so that you guys know it tastes good it's a winner all right the vegetables are super crisp tender and the meat it's fall apart but the real magic of this stew is that guinness i'm telling you the caramel coffee undertones oh it's just perfection it's made this irish girl happy i hope it makes you guys happy too but if you're not in the mood for an irish stew be sure to check out my next recipe where i share with you how to make classic beef stew using the instant pot until then happy

Esz8_KrsarI.json;in this video you will be learning how to make roasted butterfly chicken and vegetables [Music] for this recipe when you cook the chicken you will need one whole chicken two to three tablespoons oil two cloves garlic half a tablespoon seasoned salt one tablespoon Italian seasoning and two teaspoons of paprika for your vegetables you will need two pounds potatoes one pound carrots one to one and a half pounds of yams one full onion one tablespoon seeds and salt two cloves of garlic two to three tablespoons oil one tablespoon Italian seasoning and two teaspoons Paprika in a large bowl add your potatoes carrots onions and yams make sure to cut your potatoes carrots and yams and onions nice and large so that they cook and are done around the same time as the chicken give your vegetables a quick mix drizzle your oil over top Stir It Up Until all of your vegetables are nicely coated with the oil [Music] once it's all coated add your garlic and all of your seasonings and stir it until everything is coated evenly spread your vegetables evenly on a parchment or foil lined baking sheet preheat your oven to 450 degrees okay so now we're going to learn how to Butterfly your chicken what butterflying your chicken does allows it to lay flat so that it is easier to cook a really good set of kitchen scissors or you can use a knife you're going to go beside the backbone so I like to start at the tail and just cut right straight down [Music] and you're going to want to go beside the neck because you're going to cut the neck right out just like that I find for grip it's easier to turn it around and again going beside the neck you're going to want to cut straight down the back [Music] there's one tougher bone right about here [Music] just like that now you can keep this and use it for chicken stock okay so now that your chicken's been butterflied we're going to need to cut this little piece of cartilage here so that it'll actually lay flat so take a nice sharp knife and you're going to just want to slice right down through there now once that cartilage is cut it should be able to just open up just like that super simple and now what you can do is lay your chicken nice and flat [Music] and it'll allow it to cook much faster and more even so now I'm going to show you how to Butterfly this chicken using a nice sharp knife your basic idea is exactly the same you want to start around the tail going beside I like to score it a little bit along the skin so I know what way I have to go and just pushing down firmly so you can cut through the bone [Music] all the way along to the side the neck [Music] and again on the other side [Music] and once again we've got the little piece of cartilage here a quick little slice down with your knife push it and your chicken lays nice and flat to be able to cook much better [Music] place your chicken on a wire rack over top of a bowl or you can even do it over top of your sink you're going to want to boil two cups of water you can add a couple tablespoons of vinegar too if you would like and then you're going to pour it carefully and slowly over all the skin parts of your chicken what this does is it closes off the pores so that it will hopefully cook nice and crispy [Music] so making sure to try and get all of the skin areas of your chicken place your chicken on top of your vegetables try and Center it as best as you can combine your oil and garlic together to create a bit of a rub and then pour over top of your chicken then you can use a brush or use your fingers and just spread it around making sure that all of the skin parts are nice and coated with that garlic and with the oil and then what I've done is I've mixed all of my spices together ahead of time and you're going to want to sprinkle the spices around your chicken once you've got enough spices on your chicken you can use your fingers or again using a brush if you like and just rub it around Pat it on make sure that all of those nice little skin parts are coated if you have any extra spices afterwards you can sprinkle them over top of your vegetables again or just save them as a rub for later then you're going to place it into your preheated oven and bake until the internal temperature of your chicken reaches 160 degrees usually around 45 minutes you can even double the recipe if your chickens are small enough or you need to feed a big family like I do it just might take a little bit longer to cook but should still be just as delicious [Music] once your chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 remove it from the oven allow it to sit for about 10 minutes and then enjoy;['segundos']
fgFhcPyGr3A.json;right this week my mates in ginger peak have sought me out some top-quality lamb for a lamb burger oh the thing-thing it was called a Larry it's very juicy like myself moans of happiness you might say might say mountain of mind your trousers right guys welcome back to the street kitchen now this week I wanted to cook something for my neighbors so I'm gonna make a beautiful lamb burger but I'm gonna make the ultimate lamb burger by getting all the best mates to get on with lamb together so anchovy in the burger salty and sweet I've got pea shoots going on the top it's so good with lamb almonds in an almond pesto off and then to finish it off I've got some goat cheese it's gonna be delicious first up I'm gonna use shallots you could use onions for this but she lots of sweet and it's gonna really help so we're just gonna dice it down just take the skin off and then you've seen me do it a thousand times I want nice small dice okay then get that into your bowl now I want two teaspoons of garlic powder just drop that in and then you've got your beautiful anchovies now you put how many you want in I'm gonna put quite a lot in because I want that salty sweet flavor but I'm gonna hold back on the sea salt when I put that in so four or five nice big Phillips and then we're just going to cook through those and you're kind of getting it down I'm working it till it's obliterate it into a paste right into the bowl and then we want 500 grams of lamb mince drop that in salt and pepper and then hands in bring it all together so just get it there and that's that and now it's time to make into patties we're looking to make sort of 200 gram burgers and you can use your scales I'm pretty good at getting them right this has got a fair bit of air in it because I've had it all mixed in together so slap it in your hand and what that does is is it's forcing the air out and compounding all the meat so it will cook more evenly and then another little tip that you can do is then start forming it into your pate [Music] then stop forming it into your patty and then you can take a ring put that down put the patty into it and just push it in to the sides all round the ring and that way you're going to get a nice shaped burger that looks quite professional in its presentation that's gonna be beautiful right let's crack on and make a load more [Music] okay I'm gonna drop these lamb burgers in the fridge for about an hour just so they set so they don't fall apart when I cook them then I'll get them out 20 minutes before and then we'll cook okay so I'm gonna make a parsley and almond pesto no it's not a traditional pesto but the almonds in the pasta will work so well with the lamb and you may notice new era new cane he's back said an upgrade now he's gonna make a big difference to this pesto now this my friends is the blade to the Blitzer it's been in the freezer and it's super cold and it's going to make such a difference to the pesto the reason why I've put that blade in the freezer is because when you normally blitz something in a food processor the blade heats up with all the friction because that's freezing cold it's going to keep it cold which means it's going to keep the beautiful green color and it will make all the difference to the presentation and some of the flavor so let's load it up and make a pesto first up I'm just gonna tell this garlic drop that in now I'm gonna get just a few our moons because what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make the base I'm gonna blitz it all down finely and then I'm going to add other ingredients to make it a bit chunky about 10 almonds drop those in just a little bit of parmesan a little bit of parsley and then just get some good quality extra virgin olive oil pour that in so we can just make a initial base so and then just now you can see that the garlic's been completely blitzed down you don't want big chunks of garlic that's why I'm doing it in two slots okay rest of ingredients in a good chunk of almonds go in there we want a good scrunch of parsley the rest of the parmesan in I'm just worried chopping that up because it's gonna get cut in there and then get the lid back on and blitz it down now we don't I don't want to do it loads because I don't want it super thin I want it quite chunky so it sits on the burger now look how beautiful green that is it gives you an idea of how much flavor is in there and if you just look at this it just looks beautiful so well with the burger okay that's the pesto done now we've got a food bus key in the house Perez he's just having a coffee watching while we're doing next up I want to show you it's really simple but it's just a little bit of a goat's cheese Mayo sort of vibe so first stop we're gonna combine these two ingredients at 150 grams of goat's cheese to about 60 mils of creme fraiche nice good pinch of salt and whip it together then what this is gonna add it's gonna add an indulgent cheesy creaminess with the perfect cheese that goes with lamb go she's gonna be so indulgent okay so these lamb burgers have been out the fridge for a good 20 minutes they hold together really well time to cook so just gonna get a little bit of salt on there and then I'm gonna get them in to my griddle pan [Music] they're juicy as hell let's build this baby so goat cheese cream let's just get that on to the burger then grab your first burger scoop him up and drop him on oh haha that looks good okay next up we've got our beautiful pesto let's get a nice generous slather from that onto the burger then your next burger drop him on more naughtiness on the top then get a little bit of pee shoot now the piece chute peas and lamb are just best mates work so well it's got a sweetness to it and then the rocket has got a pepperiness to it it's going to just be your beautiful salad relief to all the naughtiness that's going on we're gonna drop it on the top then you just want a little dollop on the top put your top on

fmCJhIe8aMY.json;[Music] what's up guys welcome back i figured i'd slip one more comfort food recipe in on you guys before the weather warms up today we'll be making beef stew but before we do that please take a quick second to subscribe to the channel make sure to hit that bell enable notifications as well alright guys meet me in the kitchen let's make it happen first we're going to go over these ingredients here i have some garlic paste you can use fresh garlic if you like one yellow onion some carrots some celery and some potatoes of course guys you always want to clean your produce before we get to work so with these red potatoes i'm going to leave the skin on but that's totally optional if you want to remove it go ahead we're going to quarter them up depending on the size of the potatoes you just want to make sure they're all about the same size that way they cook at the same rate and get nice and tender in our stew so just take your nice sharp knife and quarter those potatoes up and set them aside and then we'll do the same thing with our celery we're just going to cut them into nice bite-sized pieces and then set them aside as well same deal with the carrots make sure you peel and clean those carrots and then we're going to dice them up into bite-sized pieces also looking good this knife is making easy work of these veggies make sure you sharpen your knives guys then we're going to dice up one onion as always guys specific measurements and ingredients can be found in the description box below so don't forget to check that out this stew is packed with flavor absolute comfort food perfect for a nice chilly day or hell i'd eat this any day of the week honestly all right moving on to the star of the show the beef here we have some beef stew meat that you can find at your local grocery store or you can just chop up a chuck roast when you're shopping for this beef you want to look for the intramuscular fat these white lines of fat that you see throughout the meat that's called marbling that's going to indicate that there's a nice fat content on this meat and it's going to get nice and tender for you while we braise it in our stew this is about 2 pounds of chuck roast we're going to heavily salt the beef we're not going to add any more seasoning to it at this point because we're going to sear it over high heat and when you do that a lot of those other seasonings burn up like the pepper or the herbs those tend to burn over high heat so that's why we're just going down with a little salt right now just to begin flavoring the meat and we'll add all of our seasoning a little bit later now we have our dutch oven you can use a skillet for this also adding a little avocado oil working over medium-high heat here and then we're just looking for some color to develop on this chuck roast place the meat down into the skillet give it a minute or two to develop some nice color or some crust let's take a look there we go say it with me guys looking good then we're just going to flip that over we want to brown this on all sides about five to eight minutes in total leaving all of that delicious fawn at the bottom of the pan for us to get up later if you want to make this in the crock pot guys you can just go ahead and sear your meat in a skillet and then cook the veggies as you're going to see me do in a minute and then just transfer everything on over to your crock pot if you like once the meat is nice and brown we're going to remove it add in our fresh veggies along with a little bit more fresh avocado oil give them a little stir around as you can see we left our celery out because celery cooks really quickly so we're going to add that at the end so right now we just have the onions and the carrots in there going in with two tablespoons of garlic paste along with two tablespoons of tomato paste and one tablespoon of better than bouillon beef base you can just use regular old beef bouillon if you can't find that stuff get in there give everything a nice mix allow those flavors to come together like a family reunion your house is gonna be smelling so good right now tell your wife to thank me later looking good now we're going in with a couple tablespoons of all-purpose flour this is gonna be thickening agent for our stew so just mix that in until the paste forms and that raw flour taste is cooked off it usually takes about a minute or two you want to reduce the heat to about medium when you're doing that and then we're going in with three cups of beef stock once that beef stock hits the pot we're going to increase our heat to high to get a nice rolling simmer going that way that flour absorbs into the liquid starts to thicken things up get everything off the sides just to make sure nothing burns scrape the bottom of the pan as well we don't want anything sticking and then we're just going to simmer this for a bit as always guys specific measurements and ingredients can be found in the description box below going in with some fresh herbs there we have some rosemary thyme two bay leaves and the world's worst word sauce right here gonna add a lot of flavor though now we're gonna add back in that beef give that a nice mix cover with a lid and we'll let that simmer on medium low for about an hour and a half or until that beef starts to get tender you always want to give it the fork test to make sure it's nice and tender during the last 30 minutes that's when we'll add in our potatoes and celery go ahead and cover with that lid pop it in the oven on 300 degrees or just simmer it on your stovetop for like i said an hour hour and a half check it periodically just to make sure everything's going as planned and then for the final 30 minutes that's when we're adding in those potatoes and that's celery give that a nice mix make sure everything's well combined and then we're going to taste for seasoning and adjust the seasoning into our palette rather than going in the youtube comments and complaining looking good all right let's go ahead and test one of these potatoes we see that the potatoes are fork tender that's a good sign gotta check the beef also you're gonna watch me struggle here a little bit so feel free to make fun of me i'm a big boy i can take it there we go make sure you fish out those rosemary and time stems nobody wants to eat that stuff but you can see the beef is nice and tender as well now it's time to add our seasoning as always guys make sure you season to taste i'm going in with a little salt pepper garlic onion powder a little cayenne pepper if you want to increase the spice factor a bit and just taste as you go and adjust accordingly you can see things have thickened up a bit now i'm going in with some frozen peas for the last 10 minutes if you don't like peas you should grow up all jokes aside guys if you don't like peas you can feel free to leave them out no big deal i do enjoy the peas and i think it adds a nice bit of color as well to the dish and that my friends is a beautiful bowl of beef stew brace yourself for a trademark money shot followed by a taste test because you know i gotta get in there and try this packed with veggies tons of flavor also some parsley for color all i need now is a spoon here we go a plastic spoon i might add let's make sure we get a piece of that beef let's get some potatoes and carrots on there moment of truth oh man that's good stuff right there you can tell by the eyebrows going in for a second bite this recipe is money guys let me know what you think in the comments make

fNccWcPXUBo.json;friends another fantastic recipe today stay diana an old classic you're gonna love making it i made it very simple today be sure to subscribe to our channel don't forget to ring the bell so you get a notification every thursday and if you like it gives us a thumbs up stay tuned we're going to make that steak right now okay friends stegdayan well that's an old classic i made thousands of those in my restaurant in the old days when we used to do tableside cooking literally thousands this was one of the most popular items on our menu tonight i'm going to make it with a film menu i'm going to show you how to make the classical dish very simple as long as you have your miso plus i always say very simple some of you say yeah yeah he says very simple but it's difficult but it's not all right first thing we're going to do is we're going to we're going to do a little different than i would have downloaded at the restaurant just to show you an easy way to do it at home okay first remember mison plus everything ready before you start cooking that's the secret of enjoying cooking at home don't start cooking until everything is chopped and diced okay we're gonna make it very simple we're gonna make just two little servings so we're gonna put a little bit of onion in there and we're going to saute it and then we're going to cut the meat and we're going to make the sauces you can make the sauce in a uh in a saucepan obviously but i know a lot of you don't have saucepans at home but you know what i should show you what it is so then you know you got it this is a typical saucepan this is what i call the ferrari of the cookware okay this is a it's actually the maya is the brand this is the seven ply uh cookware this is actually a fabulous sauce but not if you're doing a two serving you don't need a saucepan this is when you need in more than four to six serving this is really the the ferraris of the pots is really amazing you know and remember heavier the pot better the quality this is a reduction saucepans it's designed to allow you to do reduction but let's not waste too much time talking about this because we got stuff to do so remember ingredient number one always always always the onion i'm gonna put a little bit of shallots i mean a little bit of butter trust me i will put more butter at the end i have to be careful with the butter unless you're using clarified butter the butter is going to burn because butter has milk milk has protein the protein burns at 250 degrees so if you want to cook something in butter without burning use clarify about it but look i'm not going to waste your time with technical stuff some of you don't really give a damn about the classical stuff the uh the fundamentals of it you just want to cook a nice meal and not worry about it so sometimes i feel like addressing the uh youtube recipe police but tonight they can take a break all right so look i i i love it i guess so many comments oh this is not the way you should call the bowl on your ass you're bologna you don't make it with sausage look make your bolognese with whatever you want to make it i like to make mine with sausage and oh you shouldn't be calling in the bowling ears i call it whatever i want to call it and and you don't like my recipe you know there's a lot of them out there so look guys all right stegda yeah we saute in a mushroom and i turn my heat off well how do you like that not a good idea while you're cooking do not turn the heat off and i haven't drink anything so so what could i use right now to uh get rid of the water in a mushroom you got it salt yes you could use a mushroom salt like a porcini mushroom salt today i'm using a mediterranean sea salt use whatever salts make you happy we want to get rid of all the water in the mushroom it's really really important because water mushrooms are 80 water we want to get rid of the water in a mushroom right so we do that's what we do right now we saute them and we want to make sure there's no water left in the mushroom okay so far so good i haven't done anything complicated right that's the idea i want to make sure i don't make anything too complicated then i got the wish sauce and then i got a little cognac just a little bit you don't have to put a lot and then i got madeira that's fabulous but there is a fortified wine you don't have madeira you could use a port wine you could use a masala wine you know as i am cooking the mushroom i can smell i can smell the um the mushrooms so much more as you are eliminating the water you're intensifying the flavor if you could be here right now you would like wow that smells really really good we are doing some caramelization in here of everything all right we're going to put a a little bit of you can put a little bit of thyme a little bit of targon a little bit of chopped parsley and then we're going to put a bit of garlic this is a chopped garlic that we make it's very important to put the garlic in that sauce right and how long do we cook the garlic for you cook the garlic for as long as it takes to make it fragrant which is a few seconds a little bit of worcestershire sauce that's classical to do so we do it classical that's just the way we'll be making it a little bit of masala wine i mean not masada madeira madeira put a touch of cognac in there not a lot now and we're going to put a little bit of stock i'm using a a beef stock and we're going to let this cook and let it reduce okay we're going to let this reduce and while this is reducing we're going to get into the steaks okay if you could be here right now and smell this smells amazing and so far i haven't done anything complicated right you notice all right let me remove all the stuff i don't need anymore i'll i'll use a little bit of parsley left let me remove all these booze i don't need i just want to try to get a clean area so we can a work we can take out the uh the filet mignon the tenderloin out of the out of the oven no not another oven out of the fridge i got a whole tenderloin there i'm just gonna cut a steak out of this this is the beef tenderloin i already cleaned it i made a video folks on how to use this how to uh how to cut it correctly i made a video on it and uh what i do is i make a roast with this and then i make a row another roast with this and i cut this and i fold it and i tie it and let me tell you i make a beautiful beautiful rose with it but that's not today's video there is another video right there if it's not released it'll be really soon how to clean how to tie how to prepare a whole tenderloin of beef but today we're just going to cook let me reduce that sauce we're just going to cut ourselves a medallion so you cut it as thin or as thick as you want okay this is okay this is up to you all right we're gonna remove it we don't need it let's remove it out of here i actually covered the paper that i need and now what i'm gonna do friends is i am going to pound it all right because the steak diana is a pounded tenderloin okay that's all it is the spandex tenderloin so you take a parchment paper right there and you take a meat pounder if you don't have a filet mignon a tenderloin you can do it with a new york strip a t-bone steak you can do with chicken same exact deal friends same exact deal you can do with chicken i promise you all right look at this look how beautiful that is you see assembled hours maybe a little more oh no not this way yeah that's the paper that's that's that's that's only good if you're cooking possums roadkill raccoons only kidding oh nobody can nobody eats fastems out there right if all i'm saying is if you have to use this whatever it is you don't want to eat it all right so look we're ready so now what we're going to do we're going to pencil those really quick let's make sure the sauce is reduced correctly because that's what we're going to do we're going to take that sauce friends we're gonna reduce it and then we're gonna put butter on it all right so now remember this is very thin steak so we can cook it with a little butter because it's very thin the butter is gonna burn normally but by the time the butter is burning we are there anyway so a little bit of olive oil a little bit of butter and we're going to saute that steak right there coco is was whatever steak you can afford okay i love it to do with the filament and you see it's really really really delicate this is the classical way of doing it we're reducing the sauce in the meantime we're cooking the shallots we're cooking the onion we cook in the mush the mushroom and we're reducing the sauce at the same time okay that's why you put enough stock right there and then we're gonna finish it up with butter and we're gonna put it all over the steak i love it i love that stuff a little bit of pepper and you watch we're gonna wait for the uh for the for the batter to turn light golden brown we're gonna be in a pan like boom in and out of there in no time at all okay and you see look look look look i don't know if you can see right there friends but it's reducing you see it's getting a little thicker it's getting a little thicker let me put almost salt and pepper in there i hate when i finish something and then i get a comment you forgot the salt they were not there eating it but they're complaining that i forgot the sober they're right i forgot the soul the other day i'm making a lemon sauce right and i forgot to put the lemon what the hell kind of a lemon sauce is that without the lemon ah yeah yeah yeah yeah

gFSoFst_6hI.json;Black pepper and beef go so well together and in . this Chinese takeaway inspired black pepper beef, the pepper lifts the dish and gives it a . background warmth without the need for any chillies.  We've got tender beef vibrant colourful . vegetables all enrobed in a rich savory sauce. Hi I'm Nicky, welcome back to our kitchen where . we show you how to make delicious family-friendly   recipes. I do love a good stir fry, they can be . a super quick midweek meal or you can make them   something extra special for a treat dinner, and . this black pepper beef for me falls into the   latter category so let's get cooking. We're going . to start by seasoning the steak. Now because this   is a little bit of a treat dinner I'm using 450 . grams or about a pound of sirloin steak. Now for   the seasoning we're going to be using quite a lot . of black pepper in this dish both now and later on   in the sauce, but don't be put off by the amount . of pepper in there it combines really well with   the other flavors and it mellows to give a nice . warming peppery heat. So add a teaspoon of freshly   ground black pepper and quarter of a teaspoon . of salt and mix it all together to coat the beef. Now heat three tablespoons of sunflower oil . and a teaspoon of sesame oil in a wok until hot. Add the seasoned steak to the wok . and cook on a high heat for about   two to three minutes until the steak's browned. Right that steak looks perfect so we're . going to transfer it to a bowl for later. Now add another tablespoon . of sunflower oil to the wok. Add in two roughly sliced onions and a . roughly sliced red pepper and green pepper. Stir fry for three to four . minutes until starting to soften. Whilst they're cooking we're going to make the . sauce, so take a jug and add two tablespoons   of corn flour or cornstarch, next in goes two . tablespoons of dark soy sauce, two tablespoons   of oyster sauce, a tablespoon of chinese rice . wine, 120 mil or half a cup of beef stock   and one teaspoon of black pepper. Mix that all together until . combined and then leave to one side. After the onions have started to . soften add in two cloves of minced   garlic and a teaspoon of minced . ginger and cook for one minute. Now add that sauce from earlier to the pan, stir . everything together and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the steak back to the wok with the peppers . and onions and allow the steak to heat through   and stir to coat in that rich velvety sauce. Then serve the black pepper beef with . some boiled rice or egg fried rice.  And that's my version of black pepper beef a . great beef stir fry for a Friday night dinner.   And instead of chillies we're using black . pepper to give a subtle warmth to the dish   which works so well with that steak. If you like . this recipe then please check out this playlist   with some of our other favorite Chinese . takeaway inspired dishes, see you next time.;['segundos']
gyLCCZnOdTk.json;this is the beef stew you gotta try friends super easy to do remember if you like the channel subscribe gives us a thumbs up and don't forget to ring the bells gotta try the recipe it's fabulous okay friends this is a fabulous beef stew you're gonna love it all right first thing we're gonna do is uh we're gonna get our pot ready and um i got some uh ground chuck i mean some ground trucks i got some chuck roast right there that i just cut up in uh in in uh in little pieces i mean little pieces they're kind of like a big big bite right you can cut them in half with a fork when you cook and uh and we caramelize them so i have a few of them i want to show you how to do that i got some onion and i'm gonna saute some pearl onion i like a pearl onion so it's nice and uh and and good looking i was looking for chipolini onion today i couldn't get them chipollini chipolini is a it's a little flat onion but that big right there it's a little flatter and uh it's really really delicious but i couldn't i couldn't find any so i got the um the the onion right there the pearl onion i'm gonna put them in my oil let me double check to make sure my pan is hot uh i want it to be about 365 and uh and then i'm going to saute my beef i wanted to show you by the way you see i got everything ready yeah i got everything ready uh meaning that my mison plus is ready everything is chopped and ready to go i just have a few more things and the things that i i haven't done is because i want to show you how to do it all right so first we're gonna saute the onion we're gonna caramelize them the onion is always number one always the onion is always number one that means it's always the first ingredient you put in okay i don't care if you got a pearl on you if you got chipolini onion if you got a right over on your guy you want to caramelize them right so now this is the the beef then we're going to use this is a chuck roast uh i i i find that chuck roast makes the bees do the best stew we're going to really really really caramelize them so they look real pretty okay not only they look pretty but we're creating this mala reaction where we have some caramelization on the protein it's very important friends really really important so salt and pepper don't be afraid to put salt and pepper right and um and we're gonna put them in there and don't touch them leave them alone let them get golden brown okay same deal with the onion leave them alone let them do their thing right i got everything ready you're going to love this recipe it's um i got port wine in the in this recipe i'm going to apply the wine in this recipe then i got mushrooms and i got a bunch of vegetables also but i'm going to put the vegetables toward the end remember when you do this you heard the expression it says put the beef in the pan without crowding right without clouding that means don't don't do this don't put them on top of each other otherwise the moisture of this guy is going to go to this one is going to go to this one and we're going to stew and if we stew we don't get this caramelization right there you see it see what i'm talking about right there that's what i want right there that carmelization okay so look that's why you don't touch it you put them in leave them alone no no no different than if i took a new york strip or a filet mignon and i'm cooking it in the pan i put in the pan i live alone all right leave it alone so it has an opportunity to caramelize right the onion are going to start caramelizing your beef is right here i got some mushrooms in here friends then we're going to use and uh and and you know what i like to do is when i eat a mushroom and i do not slice them i cut them in quarters if they're too big i cut them in eight or six so they stay nice you see what i mean you don't slice them like i said if they're very big cut them in six okay if they're small just cover them in quarters it doesn't really matter but you want you don't want to slice them okay see look cut them in sixes all right so we got a mushroom ready to go and now let me see let me see how we're doing here okay one more thing mushrooms what a mushroom made out of if you took my class in my school you know what i'm where i'm going right mushrooms are made out of what water 90 water what does water taste like nothing so you want to keep your water in there that's up to you i'm not interested i don't want an ingredient and there's like nothing in my food okay look can you get that you see how nice that is folks all right so the beef is down okay all we did let me just push this spot over there i like this burner better all right so now now friends now friends we're gonna get rid of the water in the mushroom okay anything with water i don't understand people adding water to their food okay if i'm gonna add a liquid to my food or see like this pan though by the way look look look look at this man right there folks see why that that pan right there i got a little camera in here it's it's full of grease from the meat that pan right there has got some beautiful uh burnt bits right there so you know what i do after i'm done with it i take my port wine and i deglaze the pan yeah yes siree take that pan right there and you can deglaze it you see and then we'll take this and we'll pour it in there all right so yeah we don't want to lose an opportunity for flavor you know to me cooking is like building a building a first story you don't put a second story until the first one is ready right and you don't put the third one until the second one is ready right okay same deal so now look look look i got the mushroom in there cooking and the mushrooms are going to be releasing their water what would help them get rid of the water put it down there let's see how many of you know that what would have me get rid of the water on the mushroom anybody know salt yessiree salt right there right here i got this beautiful mediterranean sea salt that i'm going to put on there that's going to help me draw the water out of the mushroom that water the enemy the water is uh is not going you know what i find interesting you're probably with me too with this one when somebody uses dry mushroom you know they use this beautiful dry mushroom what's the first thing they do before they use the dry mushroom then put them back in the water what is wrong with you people okay if you have a dry mushroom you don't want to rehydrate it in water water tastes like nothing put it in wine put it in broth put it in stock put it in something else then water how great is that if you picked wine and let's say you pick the mushroom and inside the mushroom there's madeira wine oh you can't buy those but if you buy a dry mushroom and you rehydrate them in madeira you got a madeira mushroom well that'll be it something i should do what do you think of that idea let me know in your comment okay now if you could be here right now you would smell who's hot you would smell onion and mushrooms that are releasing their water now what's gonna happen when they release their water friends they become nice and small and that's okay i don't need the water have you ever chew on a canned mushroom don't do it don't ever chew on a canned mushroom that'll give you a nightmare okay you think i'm kidding no i'm not kidding i'm gonna put the garlic and as soon as you smell the garlic friends the second you smell the garlic which should be about right now we're gonna put our tomatoes oh anything liquid okay our tomatoes i got beautiful tomatoes and then you know i'm gonna put the pork wine that i got right there that i got from the pan and earlier at the beef in it right i'm putting it in there and i'm using the whole thing right there right all right so so far i got tomatoes port wine mushrooms fresh thyme fresh rosemary a little bit of tomato uh puree let me get a spoon a little bit of tomato puree all right we're gonna we're gonna bring up the heat this looks like it's slow down all of a sudden okay um oh oh oh i got tomato puree and you know what i got also is cherry tomatoes have you ever used cherry tomatoes or they're the fabulous cherry tomatoes are fabulous they give you a really really nice texture to begin with right nice texture cherry tomatoes look look but the problem is with the cherry tomato can they got a lot of water in there okay i don't know if you guys can see that but look at that they got a lot of water see look at this so i do it taking the water out of there look all right if i want to water i'll add some we're going to put a little more port wine you notice everything is carefully measured be careful then we're going to put the beef then we sauteed earlier all right so to save some time we're gonna mix all this up and then we're gonna put beef stock all right now i'll talk about beef stock in a second you want to put a beef stock okay all right now beef stock friends may be one of the ingredients that you don't necessarily have access to it you see not everybody's got access to a beef stock so what i do is we make our own beef stock of course because we have a commercial kitchen not exactly easy for people to make a beef look how beautiful that is look at this look how nice and thick that is folks look at this see how beautiful that is and the reason why it's beautiful like that is because when we make it we put tomato paste in it and we cook it for 24 hours so not exactly easy to do at home right oh my god are you going to make a beef stock you're going to cook 24 hours so see if you can find a shop then as a beautiful beef stock if not what do you do i'll tell you what you do oh you're starting to look good friends i'm telling you i'm coming back here more often the food is delicious uh let me tell you what you do friends you get yourself a um a um and you know we're gonna add to this we're gonna add some uh i got those baby potatoes look look look i got them cooked already i'm gonna finish them up look how cool they are little baby potatoes right little baby potatoes and and i got those uh baby brussels sprouts i already poached them and then i got those little baby carrots look at small though so i sauteed them i already poached them so they cook right so i'm going to saute them in butter i'm going to add them at the end because if i add them down they're going to fall apart this guy's going to cook this is going to cook for two and a half hours this is ground chuck you want it to really really really be uh tender you got to cook it for two and a half hours at a very very very low heat okay that's the secret okay so where was i oh oh yeah sometime i lose track of what i'm talking about and there's nobody here to remind me so uh to go back to the thing but i was talking about a beef stock so what do you do well you buy a good beef broth buy a good beef broth and and add some tomato paste to it if you have some extra leeks carrots celery and onion add it to it and cook it for a little while with a tomato paste and look it's going to give you a rich consistency like this and you can keep it in the freezer for 17 years approximately don't quote me now i can see people going 17 years we got that you know what we got with youtube we're good we're lucky we got recipe police i love it i got this thing where i do a recipe on well i'm i'm peeling a tomato tomato con case right i'm showing people how to make it american case i'm putting it on the water and i said it should take about 10 12 seconds you know how many of them i said oh it took 23 seconds it took 20. i'm glad they got a better clock than me now they got better things to do than oh my goodness he said 12 seconds 23 seconds what's wrong with him don't you have many things to do jesus christ anyway so look now let's talk about thickener a little bit you know i i like my beef to be able to i'm going to put it on more beef stock okay well why am i putting more you're wondering why what's the matter with them well because i like it to be some egg i like my beef to be also milk you see i submerge that's you know what i mean right some males like you submerged in it all right so now flour i could have put flour it was dry right dry beef and you put it on there a lot of people do that i think it's okay i got a much better trick though pay attention i'm going to teach you something you want to thicken something by the way when do you put the flower at the beginning or the end beginning or the end beginning at the end nobody knows yeah unless they've been to my class if you've been in my class you know beginning the flower goes in at the beginning of the dish not at the end of a dish if you put at the end of the dish it tastes like glue yeah glue you know when i was a kid we used to make stuff uh with flour and water glue them together we used to there was a glue for the stuff i glued 50 years ago is still glued up okay so when you eat raw flour it's in there and it takes a while to to get rid of it you know i always explain people thanksgiving dinner most people they take the dripping of the turkey right like that turkey fat crap and they add flour to it and they give it to their guests and what do they do after they eat the thanksgiving dinner they sit on a couch and they go i can't move i can't move i ate too much turkey there's not enough tryptophan in five turkey to put you to sleep it's the glue you just consumed okay you consume turkey fat and raw flour yeah good luck getting up the couch anyway so look i was going to show you a trick the flower okay look look look look look if you've been in my class before you're probably laughing right now because you know where i'm going but if you've never been to my class before you're going to wonder so i'm going to put the flower in here see how many of you reacted already you don't put it in here if you put it here well i have a huge mess right so pay attention look look you think of the strainer all right deck of the strainer put the flour in there taking the whisk right there right there ready ready look look look at this see you make a pace right there right and you bring it in you bring the stalk in okay bring the stalking don't be afraid to bring the stock in and look look look look look look look look you see what happened now now you got beef stock that is lightly thickened with this flour then we're gonna bring in because you don't remember let me just use the spatula right here we're going to put it in we're going to put it in you see see now let me tell you something friends when you have a soup a gravy a sauce then you want to thicken now remember you can't do that at the end now don't be doing that thanksgiving deal i was just telling you about don't be doing that not working so now look we'll go back and put a little bit more maybe i put just a little bit more stock on top of it i want to get rid of it all you see look and then we're going to mix it up now if at the end all right look see look no lumps none whatsoever it's an easy way to do it but you have to use the double mesh strainer very fine strainer right when you do this and you mix it up you see look now if at the end because the tomatoes are going to release more water you know we're not at the end right there you know so it's very possible then we need more flour because i didn't put that much flour at all okay it's very possible that we did more at the end we won't be able to add any more flour because it has to have time to cook so i could use i could fix the consistency with a little bit of cornstarch at the end but flour of course look if you're a professional cook you have a roux you have a cooked roux you can put that in there but most people don't have a cucu trust me i know that's what i do for a living i teach people okay this is my thing okay and i know i know that most of you don't have a cook roof at home so you need to thicken and and and and this is a perfect way to do it so we're going to let that cook very slowly bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop very slowly yeah not boo boo boo boo boop that's no good bloop bloop bloop very slowly right let it cook we don't cover it we just bring it to a boil the minute it's boiling you'll reduce you let it cook two two and a half three hours depends depends you meat you'll know when you take a you know how i do it i take a wooden spoon right there right and i go in and i take a piece of beef and i put on the side and if it if it start to fall apart then i'm gonna test it i know it's gonna be almost ready to go with seasoned salt and pepper toward the end and we're done and where'd it go let me tell you something this with the mashed potatoes oh all the vegetables are amazing mac extract because the frizz is beautiful i'll be back when it's cooked and we're going to serve it all right friends with two and a half hours went by it went so fast especially for you guys and uh and this is cooked and i want you to see the uh the thickness of the sauce you see it has to be covering the beef right so you you see look there's sauce on the beef it

gZyZTsOIMoQ.json;I'm going to be cooking a whole chicken today and what I'm going to do is I'm going to make up really nice marinade really nice and spicy marinade it's going to be ten Dori chicken now the first thing I'm going to do it's got yourself a knife I'm just going to make some little cuts there's many places in a chicken as possible the reason we're doing that is because I'm trying to get as much of the marinade in there as possible because I'm actually going to marinate this overnight cook it tomorrow it's going to be absolutely delicious and then I'm going to flip it over just try and poke it wherever you can really every time you poke it you get all those sort of spices going into the chicken there we are I think we've done enough for that then a little time though is the season it with some salt it's going to pop some salt on there give it a bit of seasoning I'm going to wrap that in try and get it everywhere get it into those little holes and then we're going to flip it over and put some more salt on that side and again just pop some salt on this side as well and rub that in so try and get all those flavours in there poke them in the holes so what we're now going to do is to put the chicken aside and we're going to concentrate on doing this really nice marinade now to make the marinade I'm just going to run you through the spices we're going to use now I'm actually going to use a teaspoon sort of when you put sugars in your cup of tea now we're going to use one teaspoon of each of these now the ingredients I've got coriander hot chili powder garam masala cumin and cayenne pepper any other spices I'm going to use I've got again teaspoons half a teaspoon of turmeric I've actually used some paprika there I've got about four to five teaspoons of paprika then I've got some cardamom pods I mean I'm not showing you the husks they call them nothing but the shells what I've done is taken the seeds out and I've crushed them I've also got a piece of ginger there which should just show you it's like a 1 inch piece of ginger just sort of peel it chop it up fine and again four or five medium sized garlic's crushed up little bit of lemon juice we're also going to use some natural light sort of yogurt Greek yogurt and it's unsweetened we don't want salt sweet yogurt I've probably used about four tablespoons for there and again I'm going to put a roughly same amount of single cream next to go in I'm going to put some vegetable oil I'm probably using about one and a half to two tablespoons of the oil then I'm going to squeeze the juice I'm going to use about half a lemon I think it doesn't matter if a few pips going try and cut it will in there and I've got some tomato puree that's a thing and then I'm just going to add all those spices that we've already measured out and talked about all right the lovely ginger the smells are great this is going to be really nice now what we need to do is just to smooth this all get it all mixed in so I'll just stir this until it's all mixed up and then we'll get it set of taste now I'm just going to try that and see how it is just try a little bit out cos that's nice that packs a bit of a punch I'm actually going to just put a little bit of salt give that a stir again but for me I think that's probably about right and next I'm going to do is bring the chicken back so I've got the chicken and we're going to marinate it now I actually going to turn it this way up first and we're just going to basically just pop some of this marinade on and we're going to use our hands and just try and rub it everywhere and you'll find that if you leave this overnight you know all these flavors really go into the meat inside it you know in between the actual skin where we've made all those holes again pull the rest of this on and again we just can wrap this all over but make sure it goes in all these holes try and kind of push it in as well because that's why we made them to get the flavors in there and then we're going to cover this through a bit cellophane leave it overnight and this should be all ready when want to cook it tomorrow so I'm just going to pop a bit cellophane over that top lighting now I'm going to put it in the fridge and I'm going to leave it overnight to really intensify those flavors now incidentally this recipe I'm doing you can also do it on smaller pieces like legs and wings and breasts so you know if you chop your chicken down or you buy bits and pieces use the same marinade and do the same thing so I'm just going to take that out of the way and I'll see you tomorrow it's the next day so I've been marinating like chicken for a good sort of about twelve hours early so just pull the cellophane off there and it smells really good now before I start cooking it all I'm going to do is go just lift this up and all this sort of marinade there just fold them down and I put that back on top so now what I'm now going to do is to put a bit of tinfoil over this so I'm just going to put symbol over it right out and pop it in the oven I've put the chicken in the oven and we're going to cook it for about one and a half hours now temperature-wise 180 degrees Celsius which is about 350 degrees Fahrenheit half way throat going to pull it out and have a look at it there aren't way through the cooking so I'm going to take the chicken out and we're going to have a look at it now take the chicken out get off and for the cooking I'm just gonna have a look smells of absolutely unbelievable smells really delicious look at that looks nice then what I'm going to do is any of those bass and juices that we can get from the bottom I'm actually going to put them back on top so I'm just going to lift this up at one end and if we can get some of those already juices there I just want to put those on top really so base in it and then we're going to put it back in the oven and carry on cooking for the other half so I'm going to put the tinfoil back on and then we're going to put it back in the oven carry on cooking same temperature for another 45 minutes tin foil back on there kind of creates a little album in itself and then pop that back in the oven finish cooking mine been cooking for about one and a half hours so what I'm now going to do is pull it out leave the tinfoil on it and I'm going to leave it to rest for about 15-20 minutes so it's all nice and juicy and succulent so I left my chicken for about 15 minutes the rest just take the tinfoil off now it's got a really nice color really juicy but what we can do some of those juices again we can Basin it even at this day so I'm going to tilt it out and get some of those juices and put it on top I'm just going to lift it up all those juices just pop them on top because that's what this chicken is all about the flavors on this is a really good alternative to your Sunday roast chicken if your family wants to make a bit different or if they fancy curry just make one of these serve up a bit of rice bit salad going to put that a little bit in view I'm just going to trim a little bit off so I'm going to use me knife so you can see we've got a nice succulent meat there I'm just going to try a little bit of that lovely really nice flavors nice spice to it let finish that the off whoo lovely if you decide to make this I really hope you enjoy it as much as I am it's gorgeous just going to put some of that marinade back on top really thanks for watching;['segundos']
HQlEg3EdM9g.json;hello oh it is Michael branstein here with the food and Wildlife Channel and I'm here with the beautiful and today Eva is going to cook my mom's Hungarian chicken even though we're a Polish I grew up with this recipe since I was a little girl and was my favorite dish and when my mom was in the hospital my dad was working and I asked him what to do step by step and he gave me directions and it's the first dish I cooked even though I burned it but for about six seven years old it's not bad but today we'll give you a real version not burn tasty delicious and easy to follow directions and if you all like this Channel or like what you see please like And subscribe let's get into the recipe so the beautiful miss ever is going to tell us what the ingredients are for this recipe uh four chicken thighs and I marinated the chicken thighs overnight with salt pepper Hungarian paprika garlic and a little bit of fresh parsley so for the sauce we'll have onions uh pureed sauce tomato sauce it's about 16 ounces black pepper flour sour cream salt Hungarian paprika butter olive oil and some extra tomato paste as also we'll use some chicken broth and water [Music] so we have heated the pan and we'll add first We'll add our butter and we'll toast the batter a little bit to get a little extra flavor so a coat the pan with the butter and let it caramelize a little bit it will start smelling like low brown butter so I will give it a minute before we put our olive oil in it so we'll just basically we'll layer all the flavors and the of the dish one by one so the butter toasts really quickly so be careful not to burn it so I can already see the difference in the color and I'll give it another couple of seconds to work itself a little bit more check out okay so after the batter starts toasting a little bit then we'll add our olive oil it's about two tablespoons and then we'll start frying up our chicken on both sides and if you don't want skin you can take the skin off it won't really affect the flavor that much so this dish my mom used to make probably every other week it was really popular in our household and that's one of the first dishes I learned how to cook and I was only six years old from a necessity plus my mom was in the hospital having my youngest sister so now we'll wait until this chicken um gets a nice color on both sides and we'll come back to make the sauce so our chicken got nice golden brown and ready for us to move us to the top so we're gonna take it all out oh yeah oh it's beautiful that's a great color okay let's do this one that's some great color on that person okay so with the leftover oil we'll put some of our onion into the grease and we'll saute them a little bit uh until golden color look translucent so while our onion is frying we'll add a little bit of salt and pepper to layer the flavors again we don't want our food to be blend if you layer the um seasoning every time you make a dish it will come up come out all always they're very good and it will taste like something you made a day before or hours before because the seasoning has longer time to marry each other then to the other password are checking us so they have really nice um yellow color with a little bit of brown edges and that's exactly what you want it doesn't have to be all the way translucent okay so we're gonna move this here [Music] all right so now we'll remove this pen over here it will add the tomato sauce that was about 16 ounces okay and then we'll add a little bit of chicken broth about two cups and we'll put about two tablespoons of sweet paprika and that's a mild paprika or to taste what I really like all but more of fresh cracked black pepper a couple of bay leaves one or two depends on your liking I'm probably gonna just put one and now we'll cook this for about 35 to 40 minutes until the meat gets tender so we have mashed potatoes ready and our chicken oh wow this looks this smells amazing looks amazing let me check double check the flavor for Meats in the tank very good okay so this sauce if you can come closer I'm not sure if how close you can see this but it's kind of thick so it doesn't need the flour so if it doesn't need the flour it doesn't need the water um doesn't need the tomato paste that I thought it would need so it's actually pretty much done I just gonna add a little bit of sour cream so here in this bowl um I have two different things I have a little ladle for the sauce and the Whisk little whisk for the sour cream so we'll take our sour cream and put in the bigger bowl [Music] and then with the little Ladle I'll put the Whisk in here we'll just add a tiny bit of the hot sauce and we'll mix it it's called tempering so if you temper your sour cream like that when you add it to the sauce it won't curdle but if you want to make sure it doesn't curdle you can add a little bit of sour cream a little bit of flour I'm sorry to your sour cream so we're bringing it to warm and warmer temperature okay it's a little process but it's worth it and I'm gonna turn it off for a minute it's not boiling completely okay it's real nice and creamy it's nice pinkish orangey color like salmon color it's getting ready to be poured into the sauce I like to do it I like to temper it more because I really don't want this to get ruined at the end of the whole process I'll put more okay it's pretty getting pretty warm in my hand so I think it's safe to put it all in the pan with the chicken but we also want to do it slowly and mix it up really gently came out beautiful didn't curl became like a creamy nice and creamy simple tomato sauce and uh this sauce could actually you can add you can make up to eight pieces of chicken as you can see it made a lot of sauce we just had four of them because it's just Mike and I were empty nesters so we cook for two and not for the family okay so now I'm getting ready to play this actually I'll turn it on and cook it for a minute with the sour cream and for a minute or two to kind of bring it to a little simmer and after that we'll plate it and we'll talk about it well we're back and the Beautiful Mess ever plated this all up and we poured some wine to go with it and let's give it a go uh so I made this Hungarian chicken with a little bit of Dill mashed potatoes and some traditional polish cucumber salad so if you would like to know the recipe you can just make a comment below and we'll make a little show about the different little sides that we do in Poland with our main courses so today we also picked Silver Palm uh to go with this dish because it really stands out to the tomatoey sour cream part of the dish and I think it will pair very well let's try it all right you played it first very good did a great job I can taste the sour cream and the cucumbers and mashed potatoes to go with it let me try that too try it again on that side yep very good try loving this cucumber salad it's all goes together very polished dinner and um monthly polish flavor right here on the one plate so on that note until next time Cheers Cheers;['segundos']

again give it aeration from the hops and the yeast and gives it a really nice touch okay and just one potato a care of them for large large waxy potatoes peeled and I'm gonna go a little bit dry because I'll get these things crispy will not find these potatoes in ten minutes we're not going to spend 15 it's one of five them three times they're going to take about three minutes to make the

just gonna dredge yeah actual beautiful Cod in there now fear it's about 160 ml so just be under half a bottle okay I'll sift the flour now give it a really good mix right now get you all on come over here pan down back I've got a frying pan was worried about fryers stop the fryer just a Tesco special non-stick pan 11 pound 99 and cause the Box the cornflakes get the heat hog and work it up okay just a basic pan I'm shallow frying okay I'm not deep frying big difference Thank You Oscar literally agrees with it shallow firing the way therefore we take on less fat and more importantly the actual flavor is delicious now we're studying okay you want it almost sort of like a runny texture touch more beer okay you can make this batter without the beer okay now from there once you've got that a nice sort of liquid moving like that okay whisk you finger sleep i season it lightly okay with that texture pan down big pan down Meg 20 gin and tonics last night girl poured into sin no no right now from there literally bang the whisk gear egg whites okay and whisk those egg whites now whisk them three quarters okay just if peak okay that means basically Tilly stop it laughing the sticking away to just open there don't put the top too early okay now once you've got that aeration those egg whites okay look from there straight into the batter pen down make pen down there you go excuse me look white hand every piece for Miriam now look at two days gone thank you look at that butter beautiful you want the batter just dropping through the risk if he gets a little bit too heavy a special water in there look at the color in that curry powder gives that a really nice beautiful dark color now we have to dredge this let's get the fish in first I'm gonna season the fish first before we go into the flour cuz you can't see the fish once it comes out cuz that batter stills it in okay now lightly seasoned into the flour run it through those spices and then this is really important now okay knock off that flour so just feel next the right don't jump it okay now look from there take the fish and just literally drop that in yes okay don't get that oil too hot if it was too hot okay just thank you all sunflower oil and just put a tablespoon I'll call them there okay that's why I've started with shallow fry so there's so much more control over there yeah watch lift it up and then literally from side to side use the corner of the cod and this is so beautiful so fresh lay away from you put it in okay I'm just literally lay away now I've got to take it off the gas there's no need more heat quick wash their hands okay now like I said if you're probably gets too hot okay add a splash of cold on to it but look at that now look shallow fry turn the gas down and stick that back on there take a little spoon and just put the back of the spoon just face the fish and literally this is the exciting part about basting fish this special or a prime is shallow fry they get really nice and crispy now look at the color that back to pan down make how we do time hold please four minutes gone right potatoes just very quickly square that off means top and bottom okay and literally square it off so it's all nice and flat so is easy to cut and they come down here now we haven't got long so these gonna be tall skinny fries from there in and then from there look down hold them all together uniformed this is one potato but look at the yield of fries on there okay and then finally there now get them into a little piece of kitchen roll okay and Rob them okay when you rub them it gets rid of the start and the moisture okay and it helps to dry the potato batter now lift up to the side turn that over and then this be faced again now cello prime should take literally around three to three-and-a-half minutes now look at that beautiful color again clothing size and then its face now once you've got to color on there okay the fish that thing cooks in about three and a half minutes that's a nice and crispy and from there I'm going to take it out literally drain it aside put that onto a little piece of the paper okay and that gets rid of the excess fat and litter that's been go in the oven for about two minutes now the fries quack up the gas literally a touch of cold water in there because with a blank sheet potatoes first I've rubbed them nice and dry and look we're gonna go in into the same oil now you can see the difference now see how thin they are and he's gonna cut loose we - it's time please hold for Miss don't worry don't worry now they're in there we blanch them now pillow makers needs me sign up now to change the bludgeon could be always cold but a writer okay the gas is nice and hearts are more importantly will get caught on them now tuck our sauce don't go too crazy the tartar sauce in here I've got a little bit of creme fraiche and a little bit of a little bit a little bit okay a little bit of mayonnaise now from there take your gherkins okay thank you to mrs. thank you right gherkins in now I'm doing little tartar sauce okay this is a sort of nice sort of easy clean with the creme fraiche to the bone nice no just a touch just a touch and then from there touches sauce and this look you're gonna go slow and then you will be fine so little bit off it and then from there stop now think what's happening now the fish is getting really nice okay and crispy other tartar sauce that's funny that's your salat oh really lemon juice and squeeze some fresh lemon there okay now look did you really pass your capers you just want a really nice amount acidity in there other half a race and half CalFresh that's a few tradition now fries look at that now so the fries are blanched okay the good news is now our turnings around you can see the exciting part when with shallow frying okay we shove it fry it cook so much better and in many ways a lot healthier I think IQ of actually cut the actual chips just a little bit thinner my eighth grade string source um okay that's a beautiful sauce I've got my lemon there and I see the exciting thing now when we start literally to shut a fire it's so much better deep fry fish raw I blanched them they are not raw make it Megan really panting cannon man honey and honey yes yes yes just a minute 30 seconds okay color those now these four beautiful beautiful from there and tartar sauce is optional shallow fine is super important Oscar what do you think down please [Music] [Applause] every time come on really look how much oil Pat them dry again see the money no you know

hswzCyTStz4.json;you want to make ribs but maybe you don't have a smoker outside or a grill or a kettle or anyplace to do it or maybe the weather's bad well today I'm going to show you how you can make ribs in the oven [Music] yes oven made ribs are easy and you can get amazing flavor texture tenderness everything from them and we're gonna be doing two racks of baby back ribs today I have one here right now and I don't want the seasonings from the other one to get on this one because that's gonna be the smoky one this one is going to be a straight rub we're gonna be using heaven made products Texas best rib rub on this I'm gonna get a nice coating here the membranes already been removed from these ribs [Music] sure you get the edges [Music] all right this rack is ready I'm gonna get the other rack over here and it's okay if some of this seasoning gets on that rack I just didn't want to get the smokey seasoning on this one now if you've watched enough of my videos you know I generally don't use a binder on ribs or any kind of meat unless it really needs it if the surface is too dry to help a rub hold well on this one I am gonna use a binder but it's not to hold the rub it's to distribute the smoky flavor because what I'm gonna be using here is a mixture of 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a half teaspoon of Hickory liquid smoke if you don't want to use liquid smoke don't use liquid smoke I know some people hate it I like the fact that it can add some smoky flavor if you get a quality liquid smoke all it is is condensed smoke vapor and water I'm just gonna drizzle a little bit on here just to start getting us some of that smoky flavor distributed across the surface [Music] and again I'm not worried about some of the rub from the other ribs getting on this rack now the rub for this rack with our smokey flavor is gonna be straight brown sugar nothing else just gonna start sprinkling some brown sugar on here spreading it around [Music] same thing get those edges alright this racks ready are the racks ready let's get them in the oven [Music] our oven is set it 225 degrees and I'm going to pour just a little bit of water in our pan here just for a little extra moisture in there and close this up we're gonna check these in about two hours all right we've been going for two hours let's give our ribs a check they smell great but just like out on any smoker might need to spritz ease and they are looking a little dry so I'm gonna go ahead and give them a spritz this is a 50/50 mix of apple juice and apple cider vinegar I also want to do just a little bit of a flex test here let's see and just just a little bit not much not much yet not much pull back on the bones again we're running at 225 here which is the low of low and slow so I think we're gonna check these again in about an hour before we decide if we're going to wrap them just let them keep going and at a certain point we will sauce them probably for the last 30 minutes to 60 minutes so let's let these keep cooking see you back here in about an hour all right our ribs have been going for three hours total now I have a feeling I'm gonna want to wrap these looking good and smelling great you can see we're just starting to get pull back on the bones not much that's the reason I want to wrap these just like a would if we were out on the smoker or the grill so I'm gonna get these out of here and we're gonna wrap them give them a little bit of moisture all right so this is the rack of baby backs that does not have any of that liquid smoke binder on it and I'm just gonna first add a little bit of moisture and a little bit of barbecue sauce before we wrap it back up because that same mixture we're using 50/50 apple juice and apple cider vinegar don't need a lot and I'm just gonna put some regular old store-bought barbecue sauce on here use whatever kind you like rush it around on the top here I'm not going to put anything on the bottom side where the bones are don't really need it there [Music] and I'm just gonna go ahead and wrap this up I'm gonna put this back on the tray you're gonna wrap up the other rack after giving it some moisture and saucing it and then we're gonna get them back in the oven we're gonna let these go for an hour then we're gonna unwrap them and let them finish unwrap for about half an hour to 45 minutes depending on their tenderness see you back here in about an hour all right our ribs have been going an hour in foil that's four hours total want to get them out of the foil now get some sauce on them and let them finish up just sitting there on the racks all right let's open up our foil packs of ribs here and get them back on the rack glaze them up and let them finish in the oven looking good forgot to put my insulators on so I had to kind of quickly shove them in here because this is pretty hot I need them under the rubber gloves there we go oil out of here there's one rack there's our second rack it's time to get some more sauce on here [Music] I'm a good brushing all over I'm also gonna turn the oven up to 250 now for this final phase all right these are all glazed up and ready I'm gonna get them back in the oven I'm gonna turn it up like I said to 250 and I'm gonna let them go probably 45 minutes or so we'll check them then to see if we think they're done if not they can go a little bit longer but I'll bring you back when it's time to get these out of the oven all right here are our two racks of baby back ribs total cook time on these was about five hours the one in the rear here that's the one we added this hickory smoke flavor to and this in the front is just sort of the straightforward haven't made products rub on there both of them have the same barbecue sauce just a store brand barbecue sauce so what I want to do now is I want to cut into them take a rib from each and that's what we're gonna have a taste with so I'm gonna start with this rack here again I could flip it over so I could see the bones and cut directly between them but I don't want to mess up this nice-looking top here so I'm just gonna do my best think I can find it and there we go on that one right there hey you did pretty good oh that looks nice nice and juicy in there let's move this rack move that rack out of the way and let's go to our one with the hickory smoke flavor this one too nice and juicy inside so both of these in the oven turned out really nicely in terms of moisture the color is great they smell great but really what matters most is what comes next so it's time to taste all right here we go first one I'm gonna taste is the one that has our smoke flavor on it with that brown sugar rub so let's see nice little hint of smoky flavor you get the sweetness of the brown sugar rub the only thing I think I would do differently next time cuz I think it'd add a little salt there because I am missing a little bit of salt there is something that worstest your sauce binder but not enough to really carry through but I really wanted to see the smoke flavor and that brown sugar flavor and the smoke flavor is definitely there but not overpowering really nice and now for the more traditional rib this is that heaven made products Texas best rib rub on there and the regular barbecue sauce glaze let's see well that's really good really good nice bite there comes away clean from the bone I've said many times I don't like my ribs to be falling off the bone tender if you wanted these falling off the bone tender I would leave them about half an hour to 45 minutes more in the foil before having them go out back on the rack with the sauce but for me like I said this is the perfect bite so really when you are making ribs in the oven you are just mimicking what you would do outside on the smoker or the grill the same amount of time similar techniques very close flavors and you can even get that smoke flavor if you want to use liquid smoke these turned out terrific got some good ribs;['segundos']
HZ32ZGfpEcY.json;well hello there friends fantastic video today take dinner on a budget stay tuned i'm going to show you how to do it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we're going to do it together right now [Applause] well hello there friends have you seen the price of beef lately holy moly you got to take a second mortgage on a house to eat two steaks you go to a restaurant it's at least 30 40 50 per person so i decided let's do a stick dinner on a budget okay i bought those two sticks right here two new york script okay it's not prime it's not the best quality there is but it's choice okay that's what you find in most stores today and um and they are uh nine to ten ounces so a twenty dollar pound these two sticks right there were eighteen fifty that's not bad okay that's a and then we're gonna saute some mushroom we're gonna do some potatoes it's gonna be a nice dinner where you're gonna get a dinner for two two steaks for 20 bucks or maybe a little more with a mushroom and a spinach and all that so it's not that much expensive i decided it's time to do something on the budget prices of food is ridiculous these days my goodness so friends i got the new york strip in here we're going to do them and clarify about it i'm going to wait a little bit because i want to do a couple of things in the meantime okay so we're going to saute some mushrooms and we're going to do the the potatoes i have a video already on the potato down it's right over there and and you can click on it you'll see it i'm just going to do them really quick so because the idea of this video is to show you that it can all be down a little bit olive oil you can all be down easily what do we need to do in advance okay a little bit of chopping and dicing chopping the mushroom chopping the spinach chopping the herbs i'm going to make a little herb butter the steaks would you you could certainly do it if you wanted to have a perfect steak friends perfect perfect perfect and you have time you can do it sold to 24 hours before and all that go check out that video we did about how to cook the perfect steak right over there there's the link and you'll see it's really cool okay um but so we're gonna let that and then a little bit here for the potatoes the potatoes the trick on my potato recipe friends the trick it's not really a trick okay it's to pre-cook the potato in advance all right so we're gonna do them a little bit of saute on you know let's put some extra on you all well you never have too many onion oil somebody say there's too much onion on your food you tell them to go somewhere else all right so we're going to saute them onions right there and a little bit of bell peppers but first we're going to wait for the onion to get some colors and the potatoes the only thing i did friends i pre-cooked them and when you check out the video you'll see how we do it correctly we do it with a little bit of vinegar water and if you look at them you can see a little bit of the extra starch and it's coming out when they start to be white like that they you can eat them right now okay but we're not going to eat them okay we're not going to eat them here because we're going to saute them first okay so now we're going to do the mushroom okay so mushroom we're gonna saute them in those shallots you don't have shallots use onion it's perfectly fine okay same family right here little um uh shallots and shallots are not like onion they don't require that much caramelization but they're doing a pretty good job at it right now little mushroom and the mushroom are going to take a while to get rid of the water friends so what we're going to do we're going to put some salt and that's going to help us draw some of the water from the mushroom hey you come back over here you did you see that that mushroom just jumped in the over there uh let me see yeah i'm good i'm good just want to make sure we're all good a little bit of black pepper right here on the mushroom we're going to get rid of all the water in the mushroom we're looking good with the onion here maybe a little more caramelization let's get going with the steaks so on the sticks friends i got i don't have the right temperature yet the only thing i'm really gonna do for those text folks i'm gonna put some black pepper in here can you hear a lot of people tell you don't put the black pepper you're gonna burn it where did i got that idea from i promise you friends that black pepper is not gonna build in five minutes in a frying pan i promise you i've been doing this for 50 years one of my favorite steak is the steak of huawei and i've been doing it like this for 15 years and i promise you that i don't like burned pepper and my pepper it never gets burned you put it in here like this okay okay now i gotta wash my hand i gotta at least get them a little cleaner let's see how we're doing here friends we're doing good we're doing good i want to get rid of all the water okay the onion could certainly caramelize a little more but they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna caramelize bell peppers chop small because we want them to cook at the same time let's make sure i'm not too hot what temperature do i have i want to be at about 350 365. we're using clarified buttercreams if you don't have but i don't use a good cooking oil okay whatever cooking oil you want to use like avocado oil it's perfect to do this when we are oh mamma mia i got to put more pepper in here how am i doing i'm doing good just checking cause i got three pain going you may want to take your time now put less pepper if you don't like too much pepper and salt is best friends if you put the salt in advance if you have the time but this is like a quick dinner we didn't have time to do it in advance so we're doing it right now okay and it's okay the perfect way to do it is to try to put the salt at least an hour before but this thin steaks that they're going to do fine we're going to put them in and we're not going to touch them we're going to leave them alone we're going to create a beautiful maya reaction let me clean my hands we're going to create a beautiful maya reaction caramelization of protein and that's really going to be some beautiful flavor mushrooms i'm going to reduce them a little bit yeah i'm going to reduce them a little bit they're losing all their water the potatoes remember they cooked already friends they part boiled okay you want to put them in there we're going to give them a nice flavor right there a little black pepper and then at the end we're going to put some parsley and butter butter we love butter did i put salt in there nope but here it is hello i know i already put salt over there okay while all this is doing i want to make a quick little butter we're going to put some spinach with the mushroom friends just a little spinach chopped spinach so it's basically a little mushroom spinach dill with um with a raw potatoes and a flavored butter really really simple to do right there you go how we doing here we want to get some color on a potato so let's get some good heat on there how we doing here remember don't touch it leave it alone create some beautiful maya reaction we're not there yet we're gonna make a beautiful butter my friends i gotta wash my hands again you know i got a thing i can't cook in a dirty kitchen and i cannot cook with dirty hands so i have to constantly clean things let me move this out of the way i have to constantly clean things i can't work with dirty hands you have a thing about this okay so now we're gonna make a little butter you can flavored butter you can make them like that i'm gonna make a video on all the different flavors you can do it like that or you can do it simply i'll show you we're gonna take a little spoon here friends let me see make sure everything's okay here yeah everything is good we're going to flavor this at the last minute how we doing here this stick let me check it let me check it i want a beautiful color we're getting there we're not quite there yet okay a little bit of fresh tago restart a little bit of fresh thyme a little bit of fresh garlic i mean a fresh parsley and yes a little bit of fresh garlic okay this is like an herb butter friends very simple to make you see look you can make this at the last minute just make sure your battery is at room temperature when you do these rinse butter has to be at room temperature if your butter is not at room temperature you're going to have a tough time mixing it right and then what we do at the last minute we're going to put it on top of the stack and we're going to let it mess it's going to be great okay let me see how we're doing here friends oh yes we're going to loop we're looking beautiful all right so now let me explain you something how we doing here we're doing good we're getting a little caramelization yeah we're going to do caramelization how are those guys doing those guys don't flip so good that's okay we're going to get them there you go there you go cooking that spinach a little bit all right so there's going to be a nice little side order i'm going to put a little garlic at the last minute potatoes are doing quite well they're starting to get a little caramelization the sticks so now friends this is too thick of a steak to cook we're going to pop them in the oven for a few minutes just a few minutes like maybe four five four five minutes depends how you like it cook my friends this um uh steak right here is about three quarter of an inch steak i can certainly do it in a fry pan but if i do it in a flat pan you know what's gonna happen it's gonna overcook the outside in order to cook the inside so i'm going to put it in the oven for a few minutes i got my oven at 450 500 put it as high as your oven can go 500 we're going to leave it in there it's going to get a beautiful crust remember i flipped the right so the bottom one is going to be really really flavorful it and that's why i flip i put it on top so now the bottom one is now cooking in the oven so you don't need to do both sides as much all right so let's check out those potatoes this potato looks different nice caramelization right there so they're almost ready we're gonna let them rest for a second this is done we're good the butter is done so here's what i'm gonna do friends i'm gonna put this in the fridge for a second because i want to be able to scoop it out with the ice cream scoop to put on the steak when the steak comes out i'm gonna let them rest for a few minutes and then we come back we're gonna finish the video together i'm going to put the whole dish together okay see look at the potatoes friends see we got nice caramelization right there and the last minute i'm going to put garlic and parsley on it at the last minute because i don't want to burn the garlic remember we don't put the garlic at the beginning it was a burn and if it burns it becomes bitter we don't like it mushrooms have been and the spinach will be perfectly fine at the side on the dish it'll be perfectly beautiful and we're going to also add a little bit of garlic because we've got garlic everywhere in here i hope you like garlic all right so we'll be back in a few minutes folks okay maybe three four minutes okay the steak is gonna need to rest when we take it out and then we'll put the bottle right on top of it all right so we'll be back in a few minutes okay friends depends how you like it cook you don't want to leave it in there too long okay get used to it remember don't be afraid friends to get a thermometer then you know how you like it cook if you like a rare medium rare 120 125 degrees if you like it more cooked than 130 135 140. however you like it there's no right or wrong here let's take it out of the oven oh yeah oh this fight bed is very hot let's take it out of the oven remember friends remember number one rule in a commercial kitchen and at home you take something out of the oven you leave a towel on it i don't care if you're by yourself leave a towel you think you're by yourself and then all of a sudden the kids come from home hey what are you cooking here dad oh mom and they grab the pan believe me i did that one time when i was in the restaurant business and uh it was so bad i'm still remembering it's probably 35 years ago where i grabbed the pan that was in the middle of the kitchen full of rice and a pan was so hot then when i grabbed it it stuck to my hand and when i went like this it took the skin with it so i promise you i never do that again in the commercial kitchen if somebody does that we kick him out because that is so dangerous okay so remember we take it out you do that so now what do we do we take these steaks put them on the side look how beautiful they look look how beautiful they look now if i was not doing my clear my butter right there i would pour this out and i would deglaze and make a reduction wine reduction or stock or something you can do a basic pen sauce and i have a lot of videos when i do that but this is not tonight it is not this afternoon this is not this video so we're not doing this all right so now the potatoes are done in fact i forgot the potatoes so they're a little more cooked than i want actually they're good some people are gonna like it and some are gonna say hey they're all too cooked a little bit of chopped parsley right there friends and they are some of them a little uh suntan but i think we're fine with it here you go put a little parsley in there they don't see it right you can also what i like to do at the last minute is put just a little bit of olive oil and we got ourselves some beautiful potatoes the spinach and i mean the spinach yeah the spinach the spinach and the mushrooms are done i'm going to put a little bit of garlic to it just a little bit of garlic i don't remember just the heat of the pan is enough to release the fragrance of the garlic okay very delicate remember so this is done the steak the steak now we got the butter what i like to do with the with the butter friends i take an ice cream scoop small one you see this i don't use that for ice cream ice cream i use the big one i got big ones to show you i got everything this is my ice cream scoop check it out yeah when i go here i want to scoop ice cream here so look you take it right there friends you take your butter right there you see i have an ice cream scoop yeah i got one and you leave it right there friends so while the steak is resting a lot of people think it's gonna get cold it's not gonna get cold friends this is gonna allow the juice to redistribute the mistake but i i highly recommend you go watch how to cook the perfect steak why i explained the whole thing okay and and i promise you you learn a lot but the steak doesn't get cold not not for the little time then it's the rest but the fact that you save so much juice of the meat by not cutting it right now if you're cutting right now i promise you you're going to lose a lot but if you let it rest you're not going to use as much okay 10 minutes i promise you it's not going to get cold so we're going to wait a little bit we have everything done the potatoes are done the mushrooms are done and the spinach are done we're going to wait and while it's waiting this um this butter right there what'd i do with a scoop of yogurt right there this scoop right there is gonna slowly melt on it look at it look at this shake this up you like this i love it yes you know i love a good sauce and don't get me wrong i love a good sauce but this right there too let me tell you my friends this is going to be amazing we got to let it rest let it rest so we don't use all the juices we're going to lose some but i hope we don't lose too much all right so when i come back we'll play then we'll cut into it okay so we're back in a few minutes let's give them it's been out what two three minutes maybe so we give another seven minutes all right it's not gonna be cold i promise you we'll be back okay friends well we are back and uh it looks like we lost a lot of juice but we haven't even cut into the meat it's not the juice right there we got a little bit of butter in there and probably the clarified butter from the pan because we haven't even cut into it yet so um what i'm gonna do is i'm going to what i want to make my plates and and we're going to put the spinach in here with a mushroom right in here i'm doing i'm putting it in a ring just because i like to make it look pretty but you know you just put it in the plate don't worry okay i'm just making one plate all right we'll put it on the plate right there and we leave it alone just like this it doesn't have to be perfectly flat but i like to make it look okay you see try to look here you go come back over here right so we got this and then we're going to put the the potatoes right there the potatoes and have a nice suntan but some of you love that i heard the comment i'm here to comment we love it when it's browned then you know what you're gonna be happy because those guys are nice and color brown nice nice color right with i like the drizzle just a little bit of my garlic olive oil on there just a little bit oh yeah yeah and then we can put a little bit of extra fresh black pepper just extra this is perfect i gotta learn to remove things out of the way right then we're going to take the steak uh where's my tongue oh i got a tongue right there there you go i'm going to take it right there i'm going to put on the plate right there my friends and now you can rub the butter all over the place you can put a nice piece of uh of taragong because remember targon is the herb yeah i can see so clarified butter right there the the herbs of the butter the main one is going to be flavorful is the targong so now all we're going to do is take this guy out so you see so it looks a little nicer right there and my friends we got ourselves a beautiful steak dinner that really did not cost us that much money i promise you you're going to a restaurant and you have this it's going to cost you 30 40 per person that's a meal is very expensive this day so let's cut into it okay friends let's cut into it because i know all of you want to see it so i have it right there and let's cut in and see what we got and right there it's beautiful rare that's the way i like it you want a more cooked remember this is 125 120 to 123. um you like it more good and that's cooker to 130 135 okay and this right there my friends is is amazing you see to me it's cooked perfect and as you notice you know we always have the critique and say well you got a lot of gray line you don't have much at all cooked in the oven like this you don't have that much as long as you paint it hot and look how beautiful this is my friend i'm going to take a smaller piece you know what i like to do i like to put it in the bottle oh mmm the flavor you know what's come out the most the tago is so powerful try to find fresh tacos if you can't find fresh tacos that's okay to use dry but this is amazing friends i hope you tried steak dinner on a budget thumbs up if you liked the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell we'll see you next couple of days with another fantastic video thanks for watching everybody [Music];['segundos']
IB5mPQAdOT0.json;well hello there friends my version of a Smash Burger oh stay tuned I'm gonna show you how to do it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that Bell stay tuned friends we're doing it right now together Smash Burger [Applause] okay friends first thing we're gonna do we're gonna make the sauce not gonna reinvent anything and that's the way I love it it's really simple little mayonnaise in there you can make your own you got a recipe we made on the channel a little bit of ketchup that's the whole idea hey you know we're not measuring anything here friends you know hot sauce right there I'm gonna put a bit of chop back City and I'm gonna put a little bit a little bit I mean very very little garlic I don't need a lot just a little bit of garlic put as much as you want and you know what I love to do friends I love to put a little bit of the juice thing come with a with a pickle just a little bit like oh that's it just a little bit of the juice comes with a pickle and then oh we can put a little more ketchup in here I need a little more color in there a little more flavor ketchup remember that's something you do you test my friends here you see if you like it what do you think a little more this is delicious even put some chopped shallots in there too if you got them there's nothing wrong with that very very finely chopped and you know what I like to do don't tell anybody okay and you certainly don't need to do especially for those that don't drink a little bit of cognac like I'm in there like a look look oh that's it a few drop of cognac trust me friends it brings it to a whole different dimension all right so now we got our sauce we are done we don't need to worry about it we'll get to it later now first thing I'm gonna do is I'm certainly going into get out of the norm for you know I don't like to do standard stuff I like to kind of make it my own so for those of you that make it the same way for the long time you're not going to think it's the right way to do it it's my way of doing it and I love it that way so I hope you try it because every time I seen or I've had a a Smash Burger he's nice no question about it it's delicious but I found it then we lost a lot of the juice of the meats of course you lost a loser you take the meat the magic and you squeeze it to that imagine if you did this to a stick you take a steak and you squeeze it to death and you're cutting board you lose all that precious juices you want to do it that way you go ahead and do it that way I don't like it that way I actually like it smashed before and then I get my caramelization and if you don't think you can get canonization stick around friends first thing we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit of caramelized onion for this I'm gonna use my regular butter and uh I got the onion cut very very thin you see very very thin and you probably have seen the video now how to chop the vegetables this is what it is very thin based and if you haven't seen the video friends then no one will release you gotta check it out all right so we're gonna do that we're gonna put the onion on in the fry pan and this is where I am going to have a revolution on my hand I'm going to do a Smash Burger in a fry pan you don't want to do it in fry pan don't do it on fire pen do it in a griddle not everybody got one of those but if you want to do it in there I'm going to show you a different way of doing it okay so let's put the onion in there let's make sure the butter is hot yes let's put the onion slice very thin we're gonna let them give some color a little caramelization in the Arabic weight let me get to the meat friends what I like to do for a meat I'll do ground ground chuck um chuck roast that I grind and I also like to add beautiful short ribs beautiful short ribs what I do it's very simple I got the grinder [Music] and and here we have it now if I leave the meat for a while it oxidizes changes color a little bit but it's okay this is beautiful and fresh and what I like to do is I like to make a a boat I don't want to manipulate it too much I don't like to manipulator too much um if you have a scale you should do them about three three ounces if you don't have a scale get yourself an ice cream scoop otherwise put it on the scale you got three ounces really simple you get yourself a bowl you take a piece of parchment paper you put another one on top friends and let me wash my hands real quick and then you smash it and you're gonna say really yes trust me my friends you want to do it nice and even do it with something really nicely flat like this and you want to put an even pressure even pressure friends so then you have it evenly smashed so now when we put it in a pan my friends we're not going to lose any juices that's the whole idea of doing it this way that's why I'm doing it this way because I don't want to lose any juices think about it right you don't want to and oh oh and you know what I like to do I like to keep them cold after I make the balls like this I keep them cold and then and don't press it too much you don't need to I got those nice ready to go you see on a piece of paper as soon as my grill is hot I am going to put let me get myself a thong so I don't burn my hands as soon as my griddle is hot we're gonna put the um check it out it's not quite hot enough but we're going to do it you got the butter in there we can just go put them in there we'll just keep an eye on them okay we'll just keep an eye on it in the meantime we're gonna take our Burger then I already smashed you're gonna see you try try my way one time friends you may never again smash your burger on the pan unless you like to squeeze the juice out of it then you do it every however you want to do it with this this is what it's all about I'm gonna put salt and pepper I like a little crush black pepper we're gonna put a little salt and then we're gonna put them in a pan and we're gonna get that beautiful caramelization the Maya reaction let me put this oh no I gotta keep this so I don't forget to put them in so we're going to get that beautiful Maya reaction caramelization of protein then creates all of that Forever Friends very important and we had when we put it in we are hot we go in put it in don't touch it oh I didn't tell you friends I put clarified butter in there if you have it in the pan if you don't have to clarify butter use a good cooking Oiler don't use regular butter because they'll burn for sure your butter is going to burn for sure my friends all right so how we doing with this it's not there yet you know let me turn the heat on the grill a little bit more and uh hopefully by the time I'm done we'll have a nice Toasted Bun and I got also my cheese done I gotta get and I gotta get also my lettuce and my tomatoes see I got all my Mison Plus ready to go here and now let's see how we're doing here I got myself a nice spatula how we doing here this thing is uh it's not really cooking or hot is it get going would you please get with the program so we continue sauteing the onion I really are not going to do much with the onion Prince we're just gonna sit there we're not making a caramelodonia but you know we made a video on Carmelo if you have a time one time you want to try to make them it's an amazing video right over there you gotta try friends oh you know let me not forget to put a quick little salt and pepper on that side as well do we sold them pepper here's my salt voila and it's looking good let's see what do we got here we haven't lost any juices and it's cooking cooking in clarified butter look at this see that's the way I like it and also another thing points I don't like a cremator Now American cheese cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack mixed together with an emulsifier it's cheese who knows for us all this time I used to tell people that's not cheese you guys are not eating cheese it is cheese yeah it's really interesting my fact there's some video online guys and a scientists uh cheese makers they've studied it carefully I watched a couple of them and you know I put a link in it for you guys to watch it how they make American cheese fascinating it really is so now look guys we're going to take it right there you want to take this guy we're gonna put it on top yeah we got a burger coming friends as soon as I bread besides to toast correctly you can also that's it I'm done I don't want overcook it you do it however you wanted my friends I do not want to overcook it that's

[Music];['segundos']
iBqgIBh7pyY.json;hello again I'm John Theurer sack and welcome to another video cooking lesson from the seasoned cook today I will answer the question of how I make a stuffed roast pork loin stuffed with sausage the ingredients that we're going to use are all right here it's a trimmed clean end of a boneless pork loin some fresh rosemary some blanched Italian sausage I have here garlic and a combination of dried tarragon oregano thyme and basil which is going to use for some of the herbs and we're going to put a little olive oil on this and salt and pepper okay so we're going to start out by cutting ourselves a hole for this sausage in the pork loin I'm going to take a knife a small knife initially and make sure that we stay in the middle then we're going to take a bigger knife and push it through notice how it's came out the other side twist that knife around a little bit now I'm going to take one of the sausages I want to cut this off because I want this end to be flat so when I put another sausage into it they come together so we're going to put a little bit of oil inside this hole that we cut and we'll put a little bit of oil on this sausage and we will stuff the sausage all the way through to the other side you see there it is now we'll cut this sausage flat again so it goes up against this one and they are flushed together in there next step is going to be quickly tying this up now why do you want to tie it up you want to tie it up because you want the entire piece of meat to be snug wild it's roasting we're going to cut ourselves a big piece of string here and we're gonna so I'm going to start by showing you the classic way to tie a rose and then I'm going to show you the quick way to tie a roast at the same time so initially the classic what we would call the professional way to tie a roast would be to initially wrapping this around three times so it stays initially find yourself a good slip knot now then bringing this under bringing all this string through doing it again now I'm going to make this roast for you and ultimately it's going to end up with a lot of garnishes like sweet and sour cabbage and roasted apple lining up all of these knots here as they do this now the other way which is the way I would normally do it with a roast like this is I'd make the first tight thing and then I just simply take the thing and wrap it up look hopefully without get my string all knotted up and then tying the first piece of string together at the end of the other piece I'm going to cook this roast slowly as if we were cooking a prime rib or something along those lines let's start by putting the roast in a bowl let's get some of our rosemary picked off of here we got some fresh rosemary for this which is perfect this is going to take at least two hours of slow roasting because I want it a pink and a little bit just a bug paint when it's all said and done and I'm gonna chop that rosemary that's enough now I'm gonna take some olive oil put it all over this roast so that stuff pepper salt acceptor stick to it so I'm gonna get very generous with the pepper and the salt and not all the herbs on the outside of this because you remember you're only seasoning the perimeter of the roast the entire inside it's really not seasoned there's some salt now we're going to put some more oil herbs they could call this an herb roasted pork loin if you wanted to it looks good as you can see okay a little more oil and the rosemary and garlic a lot of garlic well I wouldn't consider this to be a lot of garlic I would consider this to be the perfect amount of garlic okay now I'm going to take a roasting rack I'm a little pan put focus on there take the balance or whatever I got here now let me rinse my hand off for a second and now I'm going to put this in the oven and we're gonna fast-forward this video for a couple of hours until I think this is done I'll tell you exactly how long it was in the oven and then we'll take it out let it rest and relax for 15-20 minutes then we'll get it on a platter for you with a whole bunch of different garnishes all right I'll see you in a couple of hours I can't wait to eat this one this only looks really good already okay the roast stuffed pork has been cooking for about an hour and 10 minutes it's medium rare and I'm gonna take it out of the oven and the reason I know that it's medium rare is by the way it feels it's a little bit soft here you see the internal temperature of course is not what it would be for me to wear because the sausage is in the middle of this if you wanted to test this with a thermometer then I would say you want it to be a hundred 1518 degrees something like that so we're going to let this cool off completely then we're going to take the string trim trim off any jagged edges on this before we wrap it in the pastry and bake it off so I'll see you in a couple of hours you could also put it in the fridge overnight and cool it and wrap it up the next day if you want and then bake it okay so I'll see you when it's cold we'll finish it off okay this roast has been relaxing for about two hours I'm gonna get the string off of it now and we're gonna get it sliced up and get it onto a platter with a few little few little other things that I made to go with this roast all of which are just options which I have some roasted rosemary potatoes and half roast hat half onions roasted with thyme and some fresh roasted apples and I have some rosemary white wine veloute sauce also so there's a lot of rosemary going on with this particular dish make sure you get all the string off too by the way otherwise some of you'll find it end up with some string in their mouth somewhere along the line which has certainly happened to me if you do enough of these roasts sooner or later you're gonna miss a piece of string yeah get camouflaged in there all the cooking juices etc I think we got them all we got the Apple you got it all let's slice the roast and see what we got on the inside here for starters let's go right there oh yeah look at the temperature on that roast that is a perfect medium pink which is what I recommend for this particular dish you know so let's get some of this sliced up and we'll get it on our family size style platter here this looks absolutely awesome I think you would agree with that so you see how easy it was to get the pork sausage in there it's not no big spectacular skilled task you just oiled up the sausage a little bit and stuffed it in the hole oh that looks really good that looks like it's cooked like perfect I hate to be the first one to say that but what can I tell you so let's put some other stuff with it let's put the let's put some of the roasted rosemary potatoes with it let's get a little of that juice on there all that butter parsley garlic on there you have a video for that that I made for you let's put a little bit of roasted apple on this talk about getting all delicious looking this looks absolutely sensational to me let's cut back on that one let's go with those two and then let's put some of those oven roasted time flavored onions that are whole here also these are these are so delicious this whole dish with this kind of garnishing is a way of taking this kind of preparation over the top and finally let's get a little bit of that sweet-and-sour saveloy cabbage on this platter yeah we got some real food going on here this has got holiday presentation also written all over it let's get this moved up here now and let's get us a little bit of sauce on here so we have the rosemary white wine bootay sauce which I made a lesson for you for we don't want to cover up that sausage when we put our sauce on it or the beautiful color of that meat so we want to kind of put the sauce around it a little bit in some ways maybe even a little bit on some of the other foods here you know that Apple could use some of this oh yeah oh my god this looks really really good let's look sprinkle a little bit of parsley on here just for fun and let's squirt a little olive oil on it just for fun so I hope I've answered the question for you of how to stuff a pork loin with sausage and roast it and in fact going beyond that we've got it onto a plate with a whole bunch of really good stuff for you so please enjoy this one;['segundos']

iFESfa7QoKQ.json;hey everybody its Paula welcome to another webisode of the collodi's mood food we're going to show you today because we're going to be ringing in the New Year and this is how we do it okay it's gonna be sauerkraut with a pork tenderloin and we got this recipe from our families when we were growing up we lived in a predominantly at I am German neighborhood and we've got this up for German friends our families did and they handed it down to us so this is a New Year's Eve New Year's Day tradition and you have to start this like three days in advance which may seem like a long time but it's very well worth the wait there's a lot of people out there don't like kraut so don't shut the video off or anything stay with us and watch it because we used to work for restaurants and caterers that would open cans of crowd and barely warm it and it just it's gone awful I'm sorry it's the powerful gonna get crowd gonna do it right we're going to show you how and we're gonna walk you all through the process and it's going to be a three day process for us to show you all right stay tuned we'll be right back in one second okay the Louise Muthu okay we're back to let you know the ingredients that go into this okay again we're doing the sauerkraut and we've got a pork tenderloin here it's preferable for us we really like it it's a 2 pounder now you can get this started out as a four pound okay which is a beautiful thing you can get a really good deal on them at the meat market but what you do is if you get the loin like this and it is beautiful that's all I mean get yourself a four pounder bring it home cut nice thick chops off onto it put them in baggies label and date it put them in the freezer there's a whole other meal for later okay so we got two pounds a bit left right here again do you not buy the bag I'm sorry the canned kraut I'm hanging I'm hanging on the bag won't tell you but get bags or get jars and the refrigerated section very very important don't get the cans because it's got taste like the can and in its not good so we got two two pound bags of Krauts okay the other thing is we have two cups of a lemon-lime soda Sub Pop so we are going to start out with three bottles of beer okay yeah it's going in we're going to be adding more along the way so here's our pork roast now I've got my heat up right now and I've got make sure you get a lid because it's going to spatter at you all right I can see it's getting a hot it's gonna sizzle away you want to brown this on all sides very very key thing so get yourself for two palms you have to I'm solid let some of the water evaporate there that bit might come off fit so that doesn't go back into the pan and then really do a lot of flattering at you but we're going to keep rotating them we're going to brown all four sides hey hey everybody we're back gorgeous gorgeous look at the brownie on all sides and that is a must Brown at first alright now we're going to put it into our roaster now this roaster has been in the family for so long that we don't really know how old it is it's older than the both of us okay and we're not older than dirt yet put the drippings in it have your oven preheated to 300 degrees get all that good stuff in there okay that's all oh yeah can't lose any of it hey what I'm gonna do though is just to make sure we don't lose it all I'm gonna add a little beer oh yeah and and about your beer you want anything but a logger or a creamy basically what you want is a light colored beer okay not not a light beer a light in color you don't want any lagers you want it cream ales you don't want any of that other stuff okay so this just helps you get the rest of that good stuff out that the pork loin has been browning in all right although if that people now what we're gonna do is I want to let you know that we're going to put in okay we're gonna throw now these are two pound packages of kraut again no cans yeah new new new new bags or jars refrigerated section okay so you got four pounds of crop going in with your two pound pork one pork roast pork loin you can get either that's fine we're gonna put these both in here and the reason why we say no cans is because it was what we were told when we were younger and we actually listened and the reason why we did is because if you get the cans they taste like the camp okay you know what your meal tastes like at hand so if you get in the refrigerated section you get the bags one of the jars either are either eat it we're gonna bury Brooklyn here all right there in know what we're gonna do is we're gonna add our two cups of lemon-lime very crucial here now okay pay attention class this is all you need you don't need any apples you don't need any apple cider any apple vinegar any apple anything I know people want to put apples in it if it's no huh that ruins it okay pour that down over and that's 2 cups and that's all you're gonna use through this whole thing of your lemon-lime soda pop now we go for the beer we're gonna start out with three beers okay we're gonna pour them over and then and then the thing is it just just get you and drives you crazy but you still love it it takes three days to make this three days and the browner this gets the better it is so don't freak out when your kraut starts getting really Brown that's when it's really really good and we're gonna show you the steps along the way but it brings in all that flavor we've known people again I won't mention any names but we've known people that don't know how to make kraut they think they do we taught him the right way actually we just took him in what we made and these were people that were non-believers and didn't like crowd because they were opening a giant industrial can they were heating it up from one of the places that I used to work at and it was just gone awful so we had to make it right and show them what was going on not shown but let them taste what it really really truly tastes like and how delicious it is not another thing very very important do you not add any salt along the way notice we didn't add it to a pork tenderloin do not have it in here add lots of black pepper pepper away it's gonna be salty enough okay there was one beer there's two beers going in and again don't think your kids can't eat this because the beers gonna cook out of it and you're just gonna get that rich beautiful flavor okay and the third beer is not happening don't think it's too much because I'll tell you what I know just like any clean yells right there we're gonna end up as we go on and it's going to be time lapse for you and it'd be like jumping ahead in the future in a time machine okay it's going to take us three days to do this but you're gonna see it all in one episode and they ain't gonna be three days for you to sit and watch this so what you want to do at this point time as you got this gorgeousness right here if I can tilt this just a little bit but they can see out there all our friends look it up okay that's gonna be three days of cooking folks but each day it's gonna get better and better and better and brighter brighter brighter so I'm gonna add some pepper right now I mean add some pepper alright let's shake the thing ain't doing it for me right there there we go that's what I'm talking about now you can see the pepper that I've added no salt whatsoever there's enough salt in that kraut already to carry it so if you salt it you're gonna be killing it all right I'm gonna stir this up now if you don't have a ancient roaster or a roaster at all if you do great but what you want to do is make sure you have something deep enough to carry this because we're going to be adding more beers along the way and when we get to our in the future fast forward type thing yeah okay see okay we're gonna be adding dogs to this okay my thumb's not real dogs the hotdogs hotdogs my brother that make sure you got the pepper in there pepper it just it just makes it okay only the end at least two more beers along the cooking way so I'm gonna put a lid on this so if you don't have a roaster with a lid or you don't have a roaster at all at least make sure your pan is deep enough to carrying all this and get a sheet of foil put it over it put it on the top rack of your oven 300 for five hours the first day and while you're at it enjoy yourself a beautiful clan of beer okay Julius mumble just something here and I'll tell you what of I've been loving my cran of beers since he came up with it so we're gonna get this in the oven let me grab a lid so you can see we got this here thing that I think this was like on the Titanic or something and but it still works yeah it's that new stuff that falls apart on you it's dirty stuff that holds up so we're gonna get this in the oven and we'll see you back on the next step put it five hours in the oven for the first night and then we're going to fast-forward you through time and we'll show you what it looks like after that okay stay with us you're watching another episode of go Louise mood food and it is on sauerkraut with a pork tenderloin in here so we're going to be adding extra goodies

that we added another beer okay you might have to add a little bit more beer but you're gonna have to add at least one more my knee too sometimes we need to that's why we said to and if it's a little a little bit of a bite to it then you add just a little bit more a little bit little bit more and keep tasting and as you do it but a little bit more the lemon-lime soda this is day three this is when the lids off this is like the last hour so first day is like five hours of cooking at 300 second day in three hours at 300 and the third day as three hours at 300 the last hour of it you take the lid

ipfvKF8Gyog.json;hello everybody it is Michael Brownstein here with the food and wine Life channel and I'm here with their beautiful ever play and today I am going to make buffalo wings in an instant pot air fryer with a homemade sauce so let's get into it [Music] all right the list of ingredients today is very simple and very basic we're going to be making buffalo wings and so we've got a pound of wings which is about 10 wings right here we're gonna put some garlic powder a little salt and some pepper and then we're going to put them in the air fryer for 28 minutes and then when they come out we're gonna mix half a stick of butter put some crystals hot sauce you can use any hot sauce you want but I like this one and mix those two together and coat the wings and we're gonna dig in so let's get on with it so our first step is we're going to take These Wings and I'm gonna put a generous amount of garlic powder on them maybe like a teaspoon maybe a little bit more whatever your taste is put a little more then put a little pepper and a little salt [Applause] and we're going to stir them up real good and then we're fixing to take them to the air fryer and let the air fryer do the work for us so this is a very easy recipe so what we're going to do here is take some avocado oil spray and just spray a little bit in the instant pot air fryer I believe this one's called a Duo and then I'm going to take the wings and literally put them in there and try to put them in a single layer and then we're going to take the lid put it on and we're going to hit the airfry button and it's already set for 28 minutes and we're going to hit start and we're gonna let it do its magic and we're gonna be right back after that to coat it with our sauce so we're at the 14 minute mark and I'm gonna check on these wings so what I'm going to do is take the top off and put it on the protect it thing so it don't hurt the counter and I'm just literally going to flip These Wings 180 [Music] so they can cook evenly and then I'm going to finish cooking them and then come back and make the sauce so we're back and we're fixing to enjoy some great wings buffalo style so what we're going to do is we're going to take that butter that I melted we're going to put it in a mixing bowl and then what we're going to do we're gonna put some of this Crystal hot sauce in there pretty generous amount whatever you like for your liking you can alter this any kind of way you want you can put a little brown sugar or honey or or more garlic Cajun season whatever you want but basically I serve those two ingredients together and literally I just dropped the wings in one at a time like that and then probably stir them around a little bit like this and then we're gonna be back and plate them up and tell you what we think be right back so we're back in the beautiful miss ever plated it up and we're fixing to dig into them something I've always been told though is you can tell how compatible you are with somebody by who teases the wings and who chooses the flats so if you both choose the flats then you'll be fighting over the flats all the time but if one chooses the um drummies like Evan usually does yes I love the drummies and I love the flats so we don't fight so we don't fight so let's get into it looks what looks delicious Michael yeah we're fixing to find out yes hmm um that's great flavor that's that's good amount of heat oh it's it's so good it's better than in the restaurant oh yeah and it's keto friendly too yeah very keto friendly there's no sugar or anything in there so well we're gonna wrap this up but we hope this helps somebody and I hope you all enjoyed our recipe till next time;['segundos']
IQyUEp1afig.json;hi I'm chef Raphael and welcome to another episode of cooking with Chef Crawford I sure that's meant to make you a better home cook today I'm going to show you a delicious recipe of making fried tilapia let's get started to be honest if you start marinating this fish putting herbs and spices they'll all be washed away in their cooking on so the most important thing you need to have is a fresh fish and salt I'll also add some black pepper but not for the fish how do you know your fish is fresh the first thing is the smell so you need to smell your fish and it should actually smell fresh and fishy now the other way you know that it's fresh is as you look at the I say I should not be cloudy another way you can also tell the fish is fresh or not with other gills now if the gives a red reddish or pinkish in color and they don't have a foul smell that fish is fresh but one thing I like doing whenever I'm doing fried fish is removing the gills and I usually feel I don't actually need them so like that so because this bottom side is actually attached to the tongue you just need to pull it and by the way you can have your fish wherever you're buying a fish you can have them remove it for you I like removing this fin you can either use scissors or a small sharp knife you cut into three sections now depending on the size of your fish the reason why we do that is so that when we add the salt the salt would actually penetrate into the flesh of the fish and then we put a generous amount of salt and then this is optional like I say that like using it I'll add some black pepper so that's it now fish is ready for frying no need for lemon juice because to be honest if you put lemon juice in advance still and you're going to dip right I would say it's actually useless you need the lemon juice when you're eating the fish when the fish is already cooked the other thing that you need is good cooking oil now cooking oil P I'm using a vegetable cooking oil usually when I'm deep-frying amplify using that as opposed to sunflower oil or corn oil with sunflower sunflower oil it were expensive with the boil makes more sense for me so learn for the oil to get hot just make sure that all the excess water is dripped off and then deep into the oil with the tail and leave [Music] [Applause] you actually know the fish is ready when it's nice and brown like this and for this size took about ten minutes so the fish is ready and like I said we're Savin each day in Kenya we love it with a garden and skooma on greens when it's bit fried it's actually still soft and dry and remember on top of the lemon this is when you actually add the lemon and just squeeze and the fish will be more tasty so that's your dish for today Gani up with some greens and some pride to make sure you subscribe to the channel so that you'll be notified to never have a new recipe out till next time goodbye [Music];['segundos']
KeaUJlLv5RU.json;hello again my name is john i'm a retired chef from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to my latest video and in this one are we making this fantastic slow roast lamb recipe it's very easy to do and absolutely delicious you can view the ingredients list and full written method for this recipe on the recipe page on the channels website I leave a link in the description under the video or you can click on the I icon top right of the screen to take you directly to the recipe page before I go any further I'd like to give a quick shout out to this week's patreon and PayPal donators and they are francis de palma andrea rolls mayor's Sarah Parker shemot Ben Gartland and Linda Thompson and there's also one who wishes to remain anonymous thanks again guys I really do appreciate all your support and with that out of the way let's get on with today's recipe before starting the recipe pre-heat your oven to a hundred and seventy degrees Celsius that's 340 Fahrenheit or gas mark three right to get started I prepare this 2.7 kilograms that's a six pound leg of lamb with the bone and the roasting pan that you use we'll need a lip around the edge to fasten the foil to begin by place in a roughly chopped large onion all around the lamb next I rub the oil and thyme all over the surface of the leg and Ollis this is three tablespoons of olive oil with one teaspoon of dried thyme mixed in [Music] now add the rosemary and salt are shown unlucky enough to have a great rosemary mush growing in a large pot in my garden lemon rosemary go very well together and finally I pour in 300 grams that's 300 mils of water all of these ingredients combined with the meat juices will make a fantastic gravy or source at the end to protect the surface of the lamb in this slow roasting process are covered with a small piece of nonstick foil if you haven't got this nonstick foil just grease a piece of ordinary foil with oil or lard then I need to seal the whole thing with a couple of layers of ordinary foil [Music] [Music] and as an extra precaution I place another piece of foil across the tin and tuck it well into the rim as shown right that's all prepared so I'll get it into the preheated oven and set the timer for three hours the way I work the roasting time out for lamb these 30 minutes per pound and an extra thirty minutes added at the end but I'll show you that in a moment [Music] [Music] and while it's cooking I hope you don't mind if I give my very first recipe book a bit of a plug the book has lots of our favourite recipes from our kitchens in it and is available in the channels website shop along with loads of other equipment I use in the videos it's just another way you can support the channel I leave a link in the description box below the video or just click on the I icon top right of your screen if you want to order a copy today [Music] okay the lamps been slow-roasting now for the last three hours but it still needs another 30 minutes to brown off without the foil so I'll get it out and increase the temperature to a hundred and eighty Celsius that's 355 Fahrenheit Oh gas mark 4 now I'll carefully remove the foil [Music] and before it goes back into the oven are given a good pasting with those beautiful meat juices [Music] and bucket goes into the oven for a further 30 minutes and this extra time will give the meat more color and extra flavor [Music] right time's up and that's the Rothstein done and to prevent a blast of steam in the face open the oven door slowly especially if you wear glasses like me it does nothing for the camera - and doesn't that look nice and the aroma in this house is absolutely amazing okay I'll carefully lift it out of the pan and onto a plate and loosely cover it with a little foil and let it rest and I'll show you how I make this outstanding gravy and just looking at that little piece of meat there you can see how tender and moist it is okay now on to the gravy first I'll remove the larger bits of rosemary and onions with a slotted spoon they've done their job I've squeezed the juices buck into the pandal [Music] [Music] now Lum meat juices contains a lot of fat and it needs to be removed so I pour it into a clear jug while it's still hot and that way the fat will settle if the top and all you've got to do then is simply skim it off with a ladle as shown and that's a good shot where you can see there's about an inch of fat floating on the top of these meat juices and it really has to come off [Music] [Music] if you discarding this fat don't be tempted to pour it down the sink or you'll end up clogging the drains what I do is either use it for roasting potatoes Yorkshire puddings etc or let it solidify in the fridge and get it into the normal trash bin once all the fatties off add an extra 200 mils of water or white wine I'm just using water and strain it into the pan on a medium heat once again squeeze out all of the liquid it's too good to waste now bring that to a simmer and add the one ounce of 30 grams of butter the butter will give the gravy a wonderful glossy appearance to slightly thicken the gravy add a couple of teaspoons of corn flour you may know that less corn starch to a little cold water and mix them together if you know how to make a simple root thickener using equal amounts of butter and plain flour by all means do that but I'm keeping it simple now pour it in a little at a time until you reach the required thickness that you like and that's the required thickness that I like and that's it the gravy's done so I'll get the lid on and turn off the heat right it's been resting for about 20 minutes so I'll carve a couple of slices off and not a little of that gravy and give it a taste how better gets a thumbs up [Music] and just by the way it's carving you can see it's tender moist and it looks so appetizing okay I think that's enough mate now for a little of that gravy all you would need to add to this would be some steamed carrots and broccoli mashed potato yokes are put in and some homemade mint sauce on the side oh yes absolutely gorgeous you can taste all those ingredients in that gravy the rosemary the onions the time all combined with that beautiful meat it really is an incredible combination told you as the thumb and once again please consider supporting my patreon appeal for as little as two dollars per month or if you prefer you can make a one-off small donation using my paypal page it really does go a long way towards ingredients and production costs as every penny pledged goes back into my videos and whether you've donated or not thanks again for your wonderful support in watching the channel well thank you again for watching please like share comment and subscribe by hitting the circle above if you do subscribe activate the bell icon next to the subscribe button on my channel page and by doing that you'll be automatically notified every time I upload a new video and in the meantime here's a few of my other videos and playlists that you may wonder watch so until the next time be safe in the kitchen and bye for now;['segundos']

beautiful rice cobbly rice along with those raisins carrots and then we're gonna have our beef with sauce made with tomatoes onions fresh coriander green chili oh man you're really gonna enjoy this without further ado let's get started of all grab a ball in with plain yogurt now you want to add some crushed garlic you can add more or less depending on your liking now in with spices we're going to start with red chili powder 2 teaspoons of coriander powder only a teaspoon of cumin powder a teaspoon of paprika powder a teaspoon of turmeric powder a good touch of black pepper finish this off with salt add a touch of olive oil or sunflower oil give this a really good mix the color of this marinade is beautiful it smells amazing now i'm gonna throw in the chicken breast this will cut into medium cubes wash your hands and give this a really good mix now you could use chicken thighs or a mix of both chicken thighs and breasts it's not a problem give this a really good mix and you just want to let it marinate for overnight or for at least five hours all right so that looks great i'm just gonna leave it in the fridge for overnight all right so that's how our chicken looks after it has been marinated for a day looks amazing grab a plate and you need these skewers as well all right so what you want to do is you just want to grab a piece of the chicken you just want to start adding them on the skewers now you want to add around five pieces on each skewer okay very nicely marinated exactly what we were looking for got it right here all right so this one looks great i know it's gonna get messy but don't worry about that grab another one like i said before you don't have to use chicken breasts you can use chicken thighs as well you know it's not a problem now another thing you can do is you can also add onions or peppers you know along with this but today i'm not doing that try to place them in the middle all right so this has made around six to seven of these or so these look great now they're ready to go in the oven all right so grab your grill tray i'm gonna start placing this chicken on there looks amazing trust me so these goes in the grill the grill is on high temperature okay i'm gonna let them grill for around 25 minutes in between we're gonna keep turning them after every six to seven minutes i'm not sure if you can see but these are beautifully cooking what you want to do is you just want to you know turn them around and make sure they cook from all sides okay this one i'm just gonna turn it carefully it's a bit hot there you go so i'm just gonna turn it and you know let them cook from the other side as well look at that so you just want to do this continuously until they are nice and golden brown from all sides brush them with a generous amount of clarified butter this is going to give a nice color and add a bit more flavor to our afghan chicken kebabs all right so this goes back in the grill all right guys for the rice you want the heat to be around medium add in around three big tablespoons of oil into there that's one two and three all right let they get heat up nice and hot throw in the onions just mix that and you just want a bit of color on these onions you don't want them to be too brown it's best to cover the onions for few minutes so they get softer so let's check that onions are getting nice and brown just light brown here you can always add a touch of water to ensure nothing burns all right so the onions have a nice light brown color at this point of time we're gonna add in our ginger garlic and green chili paste this was already blended with some water so that goes straight in or give that a mix let's cook the rawness of this garlic ginger and green chili all right so the ginger garlic and green chili have a bit of color at this point of time we're gonna add in our whole spices here i've got some black cardamom some green cardamom cassia bark bale leaves and i've got some cloves throw that in

water and that we're gonna throw in our rice these rice were soaked in water for at least an hour and a half because these are sailor basmati rice if you are using normal basmati rice they will take around half an hour now once you finish soaking your rice you need to wash them and remove the excess starch as i have explained in my previous videos give this a mix and we want to cook this until there's some water left on the top it's best if you leave this covered let's check the rice just give them a little mix the water is almost evaporating so we just want to keep cooking this now there is some water left in there water i want to cook my carrots i'm just going to throw that carrots on the top just like so beautiful spread that around now you don't have to mix this okay just leave

kPbFx82KudU.json;hello again I'm John tears ACK and welcome to another video cooking lesson of my beer at the seasoned cook today I'm going to answer the question of how to make what I call calamari Shinhwa Shinhwa is the French word for the word Chinese so it means Chinese style komari and we're using you tense eyes bodies of calamari and they come frozen and there are no tentacles involved so what I've done is I have three of these already pound it out and cut up in this milk I'm going to show you exactly how I did that with these with this one here so I'm going to cut it open so we can get it flat on the table then I'm going to use this Jakarta which has about 40 sharp needles in it to tenderize this large piece of squid now I'm going to cut this exactly the way I cut all the pieces that are here inside this milk cut it in half then I'm going to cut each half in half I'm gonna heat cut each half of the half into thirds so we have some fairly substantial sized pieces here now this is about 6 ounces total four of these so we're going to treat this as if it's a main dish or an appetizer for two three or four people so we're going to soak this calamari in the milk to help neutralize any oils that are in the calamari which has a tendency to create the fishiness which is the reason why fish is often dipped in milk or soaked in milk temporarily before it's cooked so we'll let this soak for about thirty minutes and we'll come back and we will make the calamari chinois which is a really neat dish it's got sweet soy sauce the calamari in this with pieces of broccoli red pepper fresh ginger scallions garlic it's and we're gonna serve it on a bed of spinach this is really good stuff so I'll see you in about a half an hour okay it's been 30 minutes the calamari has been soaking let's start this process first we're gonna drain the milk off the calamari let's let that drain for a second let's put a little bit of pepper into our quart of flour here and a very small amount of salt because don't forget there's going to be sweet soy added to this dish along with the broccoli minced red pepper mint celery garlic scallions ginger cilantro spinach sesame oil olive oil this is a good dish okay we got the bulk of that milk out of there but we want to have some of that milk left on there because that helps the calamari absorbed the flour and the flour clinging to the calamari so let's get this mixed up this is really a fun and tasty dish now this one unlike maybe some of the other fried calamari that I make I want this one fried a little bit crispier than normal because I'm going to be tossing it it's a liquid before it ends up on that bed of spinach there so we got it pretty well coated here so now let's put it in a colander to shape off some of this excess flour like so then let's get it right in the frying oil let's get the rest of this in here quickly but there we go we got about 6 ounces of calamari there you want just give it a shape so it doesn't get stuck together this is gonna be about a three to four minute process and while that's frying we're gonna put together the ingredients that it's going to be tossed it looks good you want to give it a shake to make sure it's not getting stuck together so we're gonna start by putting about a cup and a half of or a cup of sweet soy sauce in the bowl you're gonna put a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil we're gonna put about a teaspoon and a half of good sesame oil in there we're gonna put a teaspoon teaspoon and a half of fresh garlic we're gonna put some blanched broccoli florets that I chopped up I got about 3/4 of a cup there then I got about a quarter of a cup of minced celery and minced fresh red pepper and I've got about a tablespoon and a half of fresh minced raw ginger root here and we'll put about a half a cup of scallions in there we're going to save a few to sprinkle on top the heat from the calamari will warm this and this stuff doesn't have to be hot when the calamari hits at the begin with so I purposely didn't heat it up for that reason let's fast-forward here about two minutes while this is frying we'll be right back to mix this all together and get it on the bed of spinach to serve to you about four and a half minutes there we go see how nice and crispy that is and brown you want it crispy like I said because it's going to be tossed into this mixture like so nice nice nice nice now let's get this on to the serving platter oh this looks good this looks great this is my kind of calamari dish see if we can get it all in one spot nice okay now I say a little fresh cilantro chopped on top and could have I mixed cilantro into the mixture I could have but I kind of like it just sprinkled on top too and a few white sesame seeds and a few black sesame seeds nice nice nice a few more green scallions on top just for fun and there you go I think I hope I better have answered the question of how to make my column our Xinhua or Chinese style column art this looks really good we're going to dive into this right now thanks;['segundos']
Kzu70HQs9Vk.json;[Music] hello guys welcome back to cooking with claudia today i'm showing you how to make this delicious steak and peppers recipe this is such an easy stir-fry recipe it's very simple it takes no time at all this recipe also does well when frozen so later in this video i'm gonna show you how i preserve and freeze this recipe for future use this video is kindly sponsored by fresco automatic vacuum sealer this is a fully automatic hands-free design food vacuum sealer that can be used to preserve all kinds of food materials later in the video i'll show you how i use the vacuum sealer to freeze and preserve the steak and peppers let's get started with the recipe for this recipe i'm using two pounds of flank steak this type of steak is very good for stir-fry recipes because it always comes out juicy when you're cutting up your steak make sure you cut it against or across the grain cutting the meat this way will make it more tender and juicier when cooked and you want to make sure you cut your meat into thin strips just like i'm doing once i've cut up all the steak i'm going to transfer it into a big bowl then we're going to marinate it i'm pouring 2 tablespoons of olive oil onto the steak i'm also adding two tablespoons of soy sauce a table and a half spoons of honey two cloves of minced garlic and half a teaspoon of minced ginger i'm adding half a tablespoon of adobo a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and a table and a half spoons of corn starch next we're going to mix everything together make sure you mix in very well we want the marinade to get on every single piece of meat then we're going to let this marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to soak in all those delicious flavors don't forget to cover your bowl okay guys while the meat is marinating we're going to prep some vegetables i'm going to cut my vegetables off camera so i cut up one medium onion one large red bell pepper and one large green bell pepper i also minced three cloves of garlic and about half a teaspoon of fresh ginger i'm going to set the cut up vegetables aside then we're going to mix together the stir-fry sauce in this bowl i have half a cup of chicken broth into that i'm adding 2 tablespoons of soy sauce a table and a half spoons of corn starch and a quarter teaspoon of black i'm mixing everything together then i'm going to set it aside for later so once we have all the prep work done and out of the way we're going to start cooking so over here i have my wok heating up over high heat into that i'm adding about three tablespoons of olive oil we're going to start cooking the meat first so once it's done marinating take it out of the fridge then as soon as the oil gets very hot and smoky you're going to toast the meat into the pan try not to overcrowd your pan you can cook your meat in two or three batches in order to get the perfect sear arrange the meat in a single layer then cook it for one minute on high heat after one minute you can start turning them over they should have a nice golden brown sear just like that cook the other side for one more minute you can toss it around a little just like i'm doing then as soon as the meat is no longer pink you can take it out of the pan and set aside for later i'm going to place the rest of my meat into the pan follow the same steps as soon as the meat has a nice sear i'm going to take it out of the pan and set aside for later [Music] next you're going to clean out your pan a little make sure you get rid of all the burnt bits because they might make the stir-fry bitter i'm going to add a little bit of olive oil to the pan then toss in the minced garlic and ginger cooking on medium heat i'm going to stir in the garlic and ginger continuously and let them cook for about a minute to infuse the oil with your flavor i'm going to crack in a quarter teaspoon of black pepper and let that cook together with the garlic and ginger frying garlic ginger and black pepper is really flavorful next i'm going to toss in the cut up onion red and green bell pepper you're going to turn your heat to high then cook the veggies until they're as soft as you want them i'm seasoning the veggies with some black pepper and just a little bit of salt don't go crazy with the salt because the stir-fry sauce and the meat have enough salt in them i like my veggies soft but a little crunchy so i cooked them for about four minutes once the veggies have softened a little i'm going to pour in the stir-fry sauce stir it in a little the sauce is going to thicken right away then add in the cooked flank steak still cooking on high heat i'm going to set everything together and cook for about 30 seconds until all the flavors come together and since we're cooking on high heat make sure you stir continuously that way nothing burns okay guys and this is the final look you guys look at how beautiful and delicious this meal looks it smells so good this meal is best served with rice so make sure you have some rice already cooked this steak and peppers recipe came out packed with all the right flavors the meat is juicy and tender i'm gonna leave all the ingredients and measurements in the description box and stay tuned because i'm about to show you how i freeze this recipe with my fresco vacuum sealer this food vacuum sealer can be used to preserve both dry or moist foods it comes with these bags for storing food so i'm going to grab one then fill the bag up with some food once the bag is filled i place the edge into the opening of the vacuum sealer the vacuum sealer has multiple functions to choose from you can select dry for dry foods but this recipe is moist so i'm selecting moist once you make the selection it will automatically vacuum out all the air from the food once the vacuuming is done the seal function will automatically and securely seal the bag once this is done i just store this in the freezer for up to three months i like vacuum sealing foods because it holds in the moisture flavor and juices of the food so when you go to eat this three months later it still tastes and smells good i also use the fresco vacuum sealer to seal all my fresh meats like chicken or beef that way they don't get dehydrated or freezer burns when i freeze them i highly recommend this vacuum sealer it's really good i'm gonna leave all details in the description box

lF9TsYEBPZw.json;today I'm going to be showing you an all-time favorite dish this is one that's been a favor to my family for decades and it's a funny dish because virtually everybody makes it does it slightly differently I know my mum did it a certain way my father does it a certain way my sisters do it in totally different ways and this is my little tweak to version of this dish it's absolutely delicious dead simple to put together and guaranteed your family going to yum it up it's being strong enough on the one pot chef beef stroganoff is an incredibly simple dish it's so delicious it's so fantastic it's great for just an everyday dish or for special occasions so it's really easy because you just need a few basic ingredients today we're using some lovely lean beef I cheated I didn't chop it up myself I just bought some what they call stir-fried beef from the supermarket as you can see it's very thin beef little strips that's perfect for beef stroganoff because we don't want big chunks because they take forever to cook when they're big chunks so nice thin pieces there and we go to season these in some seasoned flour now you see me do this before snap my bag got 1 cup of flour in there I've seasoned it with some freshly cracked black pepper and some sea salt and I've tossed in some mixed dried herbs as well so all we're going to do is put this in there yeah we just seal them up and give a message so we go all of the beef is looking lovely coated in that flour mixture you can probably see there's a fair amount of flour and there don't worry because we won't be a little bit of extra flour in there because that's what helps to thicken the lovely stroganoff sauce so we will set that aside we're going to start with our veggies in a saucepan we have a little bit of olive oil which is just nicely heating up we're going to throw in one onion which I've just roughly chopped up pop that in give that a swirl around we're also going to pop in some button mushrooms which I've just sliced up I'm not going to give you an exact measurement only because the amount of mushrooms you want to put in is based on personal taste I've put in about 8 mushrooms which I've just chopped up just toss that in give them a stir around and lower them to cook for about 2 to 3 minutes until the onions have started soften up and the mushrooms have started to cook that's cooking nicely now we're going to add our next ingredient which is some tomato paste I'm putting in two of these little tubs it's about 300 grams in total now tomato paste there's different names depending where you are in the world you might call thick tomato puree or something else altogether it's basically just condensed pureed Tomatoes lovely stuff adds a lot of flavor that's one in we're just going to mix that through now I know some people when they make beef stroganoff they don't add tomato paste they had other ingredients but this is the way that I've been doing it for decades and it comes up absolutely astonishing so give it a go if you've never tried this way before that's looking very nice now we're going to add in our seasoned beef the beef covered in the flour mixture so we're just going to toss that entire things straight in oops yes time said many times it wouldn't be a one pot chef video if it wasn't a mess we're just going to quickly stir that around a bit and so become very it mess like sort of almost dough like sort of with meat chunks in that's okay now we're going to add in two cups of beef stock a little bit at a time so we're just going to pour a small amount in give it a stir until it's mixed in completely now the idea behind putting in a bit at a time is that if you put it in all at once it won't mix in properly it will just become a big mess we put it in a bit at a time it will slowly integrate into the flour and tomato mixture and will become this lovely thick sauce I've just finished adding the stock and I also added two cups of just cold water just plain old tap water order and we've got this lovely thick casserole happening here absolutely amazing so all we need to do now is turn down the heat to probably about medium or low on the serve top and we're going to put the lid on and we're going to let that simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the cook until the beef is cooked and is lovely in tender stroganoff is City cooking and I've just added in some sour cream no specific amounts at all down to personal taste but I put in a good couple of generous spoonfuls into it as you can see it's turned into this lovely thick creamy casserole which is just absolutely divine and smells even better this is truly amazing all right time to serve up and here's our finished result our delicious beef stroganoff I've serving it on a bed of white rice and I cannot wait I've got to just try a little piece right now lovely bit of beef bit of sauce Oh YUM beef is beautiful and tender sauce has got that lovely creamy tomato flavor to it onions and mushroom flavor it's absolutely amazing mmm now this is what I call a great meal so I hope you've enjoyed this recipe all of the ingredients are in the description below and check out my other videos

LL4qFAZ3NeY.json;hi guys welcome back to my channel in today's recipe i'll be showing you guys the perfect quick and easy weeknight dinner on today's menu we're making this honey garlic chicken this recipe is addictively delicious i hope you guys ready to see how it's done but before i begin if you're new don't forget to subscribe before you leave like the video if you enjoy and let's get started [Music] here's what you need to make this recipe i'm using pepper flakes about five cloves of garlic also i am using salt and pepper and as well as some honey also here we have some vinegar it doesn't really matter you can use the still vinegar apple cider vinegar or whatever you have we have some oyster sauce as well as some soy sauce also we have some all-purpose flour with unsalted butter and over here we have a little bit of chicken broth and of course here is the star of the show the chicken breast shall we begin let's get started [Music] to begin i am going to take a sharp knife and just slice my chicken breast right in the middle just like that [Music] all right now that you have your chicken breast nice and sliced you are going to take a meat tenderizer to flatten your chicken breast now you don't have to use a meat tenderizer you can also use a rolling pin if you don't have a meat tenderizer now we're doing this is because we want the chicken to be nice and flat and that way it'll cook faster [Music] now if you want you can cut your chicken into bite size if you don't want to cut your chicken the way i cut mine you can also cut them into right sides [Music] now it's time to season our chicken breast what i'm doing first is drizzling a little bit of olive oil onto the chicken once i am done i am going to use my hand to rub it in next i am about to take my seasoning to season the chicken breast i am using salt and pepper and don't worry guys i know i'm not using a lot of seasoning that i normally use but all the flavor is going to come from the garlic the oyster sauce the soy sauce this will come out so good once it's done so just trust the process okay now we're going to sprinkle the salt and pepper all over the chicken breast then we're going to flip it over and of course add the salt and pepper on the other side [Music] now you're going to take your flour you're going to dredge the chicken into the flour you want a light coat of the flour don't overdo it you don't want the breading to be too heavy so don't overdo it and i'll show you guys what to do with it next [Music] in once you are done adding the flour to all of your chicken you're going to set them aside to cook the chicken i am going to add two tablespoons of unsalted butter to a frying pan oops i added a little bit too much two tablespoons once melted we're going to add the chicken in as you guys can see i have some new frying pan i have some new cooking wear that i'm very excited to cook with and this is not sponsored i bought them from amazon i will have a link below if you're interested so we're going to add the chicken in don't move it don't touch it just let it cook for about five minutes per side then flip it over cook the other side you all know how dry chicken breast can be sometimes now if you know how to properly cook them it will not be dry so don't overcook your chicken breast that's the key if you overcook it it will be dry guaranteed dry dry dry so try not to overcook your chicken breast so it can be nice and juicy once your chicken is done cooking you're going to remove it set it aside just look how beautiful this came out i just love cooking in this new frying pan because my food come out so colorful and not burnt so what we're going to do now is use the same skillet i know i washed mine but use the same skillet add the rest of the butter in you are going to cook your garlic okay that's that's the garlic right there make sure you chop them pretty small unless you like chewing on big chunks of garlic so make sure you mince them so we're going to cook the garlic until it's kind of fragrant and turning golden brown and then you can add the remaining of the ingredients [Music] a few seconds later i am going in with my dry pepper flakes don't add too much of this a little bit goes a long way okay so i am going to add that in and stir it together next i am going in with my honey just pour that in honey garlic i love love love the combination of that flavor all right now i am going to stir it together as the honey is cooking make sure you're cooking it on medium low at this point now i'm going to be adding in my oyster sauce just stir it in and of course i have to get every little bit of sauce so i went ahead and grabbed a spoon and just scraped every little bit of oyster sauce that was on that little bowl now i'm going to be adding in my vinegar and of course we're going to add in the soy sauce as well like i said you can add any type of vinegar in this it doesn't really matter just to add some hints of vinegary flavor in there now i am going in with my chicken broth of course once i'm done pouring that in i am going to stir it let it simmer and we want to let it simmer for about two to three minutes then you can add in your chicken now i am going to be placing the chicken right in the sauce i know the sauce look a little bit watery now but once you add the chicken don't forget the chicken has that flour breading to it it will make it nice and thick and this is basically a few minutes after i turned down my heat as you guys can see and look how perfect our chicken looks i am going to use some fresh parsley just you know just for garnish just add it on top of there and at this point your meal your dish is ready this is how you make the perfect honey garlic chicken thank you for

ltA2ACNV3Gg.json;guys welcome to my channel if you're new my name is din and i'm going to show you how to prepare your ingredients mix the spices and then cook the dish very simple method i'm going to use so please follow the instructions carefully so let's cook [Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel i'm chef dinh and today i'm going to cook you a beef curry now this is a delicious dish you can use any cut of meat to cook this dish i've used beef on the bone but if you don't like beef on the bone then just use just beef chunks and cook this curry it's absolutely delicious you and your friends will love it so i'm going to show you from scratch this one pot curry where you don't need any base gravy and i'm going to put some potatoes in with this you can put whatever vegetable you like so let's not waste any more time and let's start cooking [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to add two large tomatoes what i've done is cut them in half and also cut off the stalks so this way what we're going to do is let them cook for a little while in the steam and remove the skin this is a good good way to basically not have any tomato skins in your curry so try this method it works really well and very simple to use as well this beef recipe is enough for six people but i would serve it with a lentil or vegetable dish on the side and serve with polar rice these recipes you'll find as well on my channel and they go well together as well so give it a go [Music] now is the time where we would add our three cups of water and bring it to the boil and simmer for about hour and 20 minutes you may have to cook yours a bit longer or a bit less it depends on the cut of meat you're using so just fill the meat with your fingers to see if it's soft enough for you before you start to add your spices it's been hour and 20 minutes that uh this curry has been simmering away and mine is nice and tender and it's ready to add spices yours may take a little bit longer so if it does just carry on simmering for another 10 15 20 minutes uh what you will need and then start adding the spices i would suggest getting all your spices ready before you get to this process so that you don't delay with the cooking process at this stage we're going to add our vegetable i'm going to add potatoes because that's one of my favorite vegetables in the curry especially beef curry or meat curries i i do love my potatoes but you can add any vegetable you like you can also add carrot if you like but when you add carrot you need to add a little bit extra chili because the carrot is sweet so that will combat the sweetness so give it a good stir and uh let that potatoes break down the gravy even more to give it a nice smooth sauce so what we're going to do for the next few minutes just keep stirring it and breaking the onions down right that's it we're nearly ready now we're going to just add the water make sure it's boiling hot water we don't want to stop the process of cooking and then basically bring it to the boil and turn it right down on low heat and let it simmer for 20 minutes for the vegetables to cook and that's it job done this is my beef curry i hope you enjoy it please write in the comments what you think and if you haven't subscribed to my channel please subscribe and tell all your friends so bye for now and enjoy this beautiful beef curry [Music] you;['segundos']
lVcTvHTn6Dw.json;well hello there friends today very important video how to cook the perfect steak i figured there was a lot of information on the internet i didn't need to do any a video about how to cook a steak but there's so much bad information out there that i decide to debunk all of the myths out there that are entrue number one take out your steak at least 20 minutes before you cook what does that do nothing no no i'm telling you friends i know everybody's saying it i've done it so many times i said let me check it see what's happening take a thermometer take the steak out take the temperature take it out 20 minutes later and do the same thing i guess what you get nothing maybe a net one and a half two degrees difference if you take it out 20 minutes before you cook it that means nothing so don't waste your time taking the steak out another myth out there don't salt it just until you're ready to go because it's going to pull the moisture that's correct if you put the salt just before you cook that's exactly what's going to happen matter of fact we're going to demonstrate it all right i got two stacks in here this salt as you can see a little darker red um has been salted 24 hours ago this guy right there we just got it at the store so this one has not been salted you can see a little glistening in there there's a little moisture in there i want to get rid of that the secret of a good steak is moisture we want to get rid of the moisture how do we do that we take a salt and be careful no i've seen guys out there putting so much salt in there it ruins the steak you don't want to put too much salt you want to put enough salt just a little bit that looks like fine we don't want to put too much that's a lot of salt already okay just maybe that's it that's it no more salt than that right we're going to put it in we're going to rub it in we're going to flip it on the other side okay and we're going to put it back in the on the other side how much don't put too much salt don't put the material you don't need much salt you want to put some on the side and that's it now we're going to take this steak you're going to be amazing what you're going to learn you're going to love this this is really good i'm very excited to teach you this you can see every time i'm watching somebody doing it wrong i'm like mama me who taught you to cook a steak we're gonna put this in the fridge friends ten minutes from now we're gonna come back let me put it in here just like that open oh i forgot to tell you you need a rack a sheet pen with a rack that allows you to get the air to circulate it you don't want to age a steak in a in a plastic bag or in a wrapper the minute you get it home they're gonna put it on a rack if you're gonna eat it within a few days put the salt on it like i just did leave it in there longer you leave it better off it is we're going to demonstrate that in a minute so i'll come back in about 10 minutes from now and you're going to see what happened to the salt then i put in on there you're going to see but the process of osmosis is going to osmosis that's a difficult word for a french person it's going to remove you're going to see it's going to draw the moisture out and the secret that happens within 10 to 15 minutes the secret is to leave it long enough at least 45 minutes for that juice to go back in now that juice is nice salty all of the juice and have the right amount of salt so don't let them tell you don't salt it until you put it in salt it as soon as you get it and when you're ready to eat it so we'll come back in about 10 minutes and we'll go over the other myth about how to cook the perfect steak i'm going to show you exactly how to do it so we'll be right back about 10 minutes from now all right friends 10 minutes went by just 10 minutes that's all you need you're going to be amazed you're going to be unless you've made the test before if you did then you're not going to be amazed look at this friends look at this look at this we we got to make sure the camera gets right in there you see this is only 10 minutes you see the the salt is putting out all the juices so if we were to cook it right now we lose all the juices we don't want to lose it we want to put it back inside and this is the seed the cyst the secret is right there is to have a dry outside that's what happened now 10 minutes that's what happened within at least 45 minutes it's the minimum you got to do this okay 45 minutes to an hour this is what's gonna happen the juice went back inside so now we're ready to cook we'll go back and put this in a fridge later now we'll cook it now a lot of people says to me aren't you cooking in clarified butter you can cook it in clarified butter but if you do you don't get as much of a crust and you know it's all about the cost so an avocado oil is a very high smoke point oil and it creates a really nice crust so we're using the avocado oil okay you can use whatever makes you happy friends but if you use regular butter you know it's gonna burn burn burn burn and we don't want it to do that all right so salt we got already we don't need to do that pepper you can put it now it's not going to burn or you can wait and put it in leather i like crushed bread pepper at the last minute in it if you didn't put it down nothing's going to happen to it some people oh you put it now you're going to burn no you don't burn it it's really up to you it's not a pepper steak so i'm not going to do that the oil i like to get it about 400 degrees about 400 fahrenheit if you don't have one of those skip an eyelet you'll feel it when it's 400. now an avocado has a great smoke bone so you don't see it smoking if you put olive oil in there it's going to burn for sure okay now here it is look beautiful big big steak right there dry as a bone look at this it's here same thing look at look at this guy right here it's amazing so we're going to take it in now right now friend and we're going to put it in and now don't touch it we're going to put this in the fridge because i don't like to leave it out and this i'll eat it tomorrow so now no touching not playing around with it let's make sure we got the right heat we're going to leave it alone now what happens is i like to do a cast iron pan because it retains the heat so then the steak doesn't take all the heat out of a thin fry pan but if you have a good thick stainless steel frypan or a copper pan nothing wrong with it cast iron is the easiest thing to deal with you just got to deal with it taking care of it make sure you have a handle of it when you put them in the oven so what we're going to do we're going to give it a beautiful crush right here let me make sure it's still going and then let's talk a little bit about a very important thing the salt what salt did i use i used a kosher salt you want a kind of a crusty uh thick salt the granulated salt not a fine table salt you want to make sure you put it on a kosher salt is perfect fleur de cell is another perfect cell for salt for that you also got to give yourself a thermometer frame get yourself a good thermometer this is the twenty dollar aftermath but it works great this is a hundred dollar thermometer it's thermapen it's a great thermometer this one what's the difference between the hundred dollar one and the twenty dollar one the hundred dollar one reads in three seconds the twenty dollar one reason about ten seconds so if you got seven seconds to spare you save 80 bucks up to you whatever you want to do i got him right here we don't want to forget him because this thing about pushing the thumb and all that stuff oh yeah if you push over here it's medium rare if you push it over there it's rare if you put it there it's well done hello try to touch your wife or your husband tom and you see completely different so which one do you use hers or yours so everybody's thumb is completely different that makes absolutely no sense at all what makes sense is the thermometer and don't be afraid to poke it we'll talk about that in a minute so i put it in i when it's a thick stick like that like an inch an inch and a half i do not like make sure it's quick i do not like to live in the pan the whole time because here's what happens you end up burning the outside in order to cook the inside so we're going to take it out and we're going to get a beautiful crust right here and we're starting to build the crust we're gonna flip it on the other side now there's so many information right there do you flip it how many times do you flip it if you have a thin steak leave it alone because you're not going to build a nice caramelization of the maya reaction the caramelization or protein you're not going to do that if it's thin because if you keep moving it you're not going to build that font in the bottom of the pen and that maya reaction so it's very important so what i do is i cook it one or two minutes on each side then i pop it in the oven for a few minutes because the oven makes it way i don't burn on the outside in order to cook the inside so if you have a thin steak you can do it in frypan the whole time don't worry but if you have a a thick steak you want to pop it in the oven otherwise you're going to end up burning the outside in order to cook the inside okay so we're going to put it in because it's a little smoky but that's good that's what we want we're going to wait though don't forget mison plus we don't have much i have a little fresh thyme i have some garlic and i have some shallot and i got butter i am going to use some butter but we'll use that at the end so we don't burn it remember butter burns up 250 degrees if i put butter what i got is burn butter and who wants burnt butter all right so what we're going to do friends we're going to take that fry pan we're going to put it in the oven i guess i can use it like that we're going to put it in the oven and in a two minutes from now we're gonna flip it i'm gonna show you okay so we're living in the oven right now in about two minutes from now i'm gonna flip it so i'll come back in about two minutes from now okay it's been there two minutes i'm gonna flip it flip it just a little bit longer one more time oh yeah we're getting a beautiful crust friends it's really looking beautiful and we're gonna leave it in there another two or three minutes and then we're gonna check it one more time all right it's been in the oven about a total of about six minutes we're gonna take it out and we're gonna finish it up in the fry pan now friends all we're gonna do now look look it's starting to look beautiful we got a beautiful crust okay we're gonna do the sides of it now don't forget the sides friends very important we get a nice side and now we're gonna add some butter let me just finish the side now we're gonna do we're gonna add a little bit of butter that's my best bar and then we're gonna add some i got some fresh thyme i got some shallots and garlic don't forget to do the side very important friends nice job on the side and we're going to spoon some of that beautiful butter we're going to spoon some of that beautiful butter right there friends oh there's extra butter we're going to spoon some of that extra butter right there on top ones gonna give it a little flavor it's gonna take a little time but this right there friends look at this look at this ooh baby look at this the smell of it is amazing intoxicating it another thing you hear all the people tell you um make sure you sear sear in the steak right away the sealing the juices [Music] the juice are going to come out with or without a so the secret is the letter rest and we're going to talk about that when we're ready to let our restaurants when we're ready to let our race that's when we're going to talk about it we're not ready to let her rest yet so now very important we check temperature i want to take it out about 120. i love the sound of it i want to take it out at about 120 my friends 120 125 but i like a medium rare rare so it's up to you if you like a more cook remember friends there's nothing wrong with the way you like a cook you like it raw god bless you you're like a medium rare god bless you you're like a medium god you're like a well done god bless you it doesn't matter it's not let anybody take your order so wrong way to either you're out of rare or you don't either get out of my kitchen okay you eat it however you want to eat it friends okay don't let anybody tell you your way to do it is wrong look at this steak now this is how to cook the perfect steak my friends we got a beautiful color the smell of it is absolutely amazing so now we're going to check the temperature friends very important now we're looking for 120 to take it out because the curry over eating is going to continue cooking so if i have 120 now i'm very happy oh take it easy here you got to be careful don't go all the way to the other side so let's see what i got right here friends it says 125 but um i went a little too deep all right that's another thing that went too deep i'm about 120 116 120. you know that's enough for me friends i'm just going to let it rest just a little bit longer put a little more butter in there the garlic is getting a little caramelized that's okay we're not gonna eat it we just want that flavor right there in another video i'm going to show you how to make some beautiful sauces i decided i'm going to make a whole collection of uh of of sausage friends all right so we're going to let it rest it's very important we let our rest friends are we doing oh look at this does that look beautiful or what oh yeah that looks beautiful look at this we're going to take it we're going to put it right there however side we want to put it in that's beautiful look at our crust look at this that's gorgeous and we're going to take a little bit of this right there on top and we're going to let it rest on a cutting board and i'll explain to you what happened why do we need it right away so you understand it the whole concept of it maybe for uh later on i put some fresh thyme leaves in there so it looks beautiful don't be afraid to put some butter in there right there oh yeah look at this friends does that look beautiful or what huh wait until we cut into it it's going to be beautiful oh we put this aside right here let me explain you a couple of things friends next time i got to put some herbs some fresh-looking herbs in there so we do a nice thumbnail well here's what's happening with the juices you know you say if you cut it right away you lose all the juice you do here's what happened you remember when you put it in the pan you hear that sizzling what happened is the outside and the the both side sides are heating the pan 400 degrees right now on the outside of the stack is about 200 degrees and that's at that level of heat the juices are being expelled there is no juice on the outside of it all the juices in the middle of the meat and the meat is about 120 degrees now on the inside they can hold the juice we need to let the outside cool at about 120 130 so then the juices can go from the metal a little more on the outside and we distribute so then we don't lose all the juices when we cut oh let me turn this off okay you understand what i'm saying we need the letter rest so the juices can go back from the inside and redistribute a little bit on the outside and and and and that's all we need to do we need to let the rest do you need to let it rest about 10 minutes five minutes not enough about 10 minutes and then you slice it and it'll be absolutely beautiful so we're going to wait 10 minutes and i'll come back and we're going to slice it okay friends 10 minutes went by you got to lie and wait 10 minutes be patient and all we're going to do now friends we're just going to cut into it i love that crust you hear that yes sir and we're going to cut right in friends and voila beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful friends oh yeah now it's time to get the fork out cut it however you wanna friends but let me tell you this is perfectly perfectly cooked look at this look at this oh i forgot i'm tasting it and i'm going with the pepper i forgot the paper one day i'm gonna forget my head my mom used to say if your head was

M00LQGPAYsg.json;well hello there friends my favorite breakfast take an egg i'm going to show you how to make with home fries delicious stay tuned i'm going to show you exactly how to do it don't forget subscribe to the channel gives us a thumbs up if you like the video and don't forget to ring the bell stay tuned i'm going to show you how to make this wonderful steak and egg well let me show you how easy it is to prepare my favorite steak and egg that's what i have when i go out to breakfast so i'm going to show you the way i like to make it very simple mison plus we got a steak it's a new york street it's very thin because take an egg without eating a one pound steak uh we got some onion bacon potatoes we're gonna make home fries with it and then we got some peppers and garlic and a bit of parsley and then we're gonna do the whole thing really quick so the first thing we do we put a little bit of clarified butter friends if you're off clarify butter use a vegetable or just a regular butter but it's going to burn though so we have to be careful we don't really like to burn the butter that much when the fry pan is hot we are then going to put the bacon remember bacon is number one after on your onion is always number one unless there is bacon let's remember that it's very important we're going to take and put our bacon in there and uh we're gonna saute our bacon and we're gonna the reason why you put the bacon first friends most of you that know that i've seen my channel before is because we want to render the fat and then we're gonna use that fat and those home fries potatoes are going to be beautiful this is the equally smoked bacon and the pan needs to get a little harder but it will in a minute i don't want to go too hot it's very important friends you don't want to go too hot otherwise what happened is you end up burning the lean part of the bacon uh before the fat has time to render so it's very important okay so we're gonna wait just a second get me some fat right there rendered you see just a little bit and then we got the potatoes now the potatoes you've seen me dust potatoes in a few recipes very important everything be the same size size matter in cooking friends because if they're two they're not the same size some are going to cook faster than others right the onion the onion i didn't dice them i sliced them so i took a big onion right and i cut it in half right you cut it in half now i have my two half and then i cut it this way and then i'll cut it like that so i have little pieces you see so they're not minced they're not too little so they are present in the potatoes and we're going to caramelize them nice you see and then we're going to get the potatoes going and while after the potatoes have a good good head start then we're going to do the um we're going to do the steak the steak is going to take two minutes see it's very thin and it's not one of those if you want a big steak you should watch a steak video you guys have been fantastic the comments have been amazing you have to watch the steak video and you'll see uh the right way to do it your friends is to uh you put the salt i put the salt like an hour ago and you put it in the fridge let it salt you don't need to put any more salt in there it's got enough salt it'll go right through it it'll be you see it'll be real seasoned for those of you that are not doubting why am i putting the salt that's going to evaporate no it's not it's going to juice it's going to put it out and it's going to go right back in and season it you should do it you should try and you put the salt you put it in the fridge and our ladder you test you see there's no more salt in here it's all inside so we're going to wait for this to get a little more uh caramelized before we put the onion okay so i'll be back in a minute when the bacon has rendered all of its fat and we can put the onion in there are you back in one little minute it's gonna take a few minutes okay okay so now you can see it took about three or four five minutes three four five there was a three of the four the five i don't know it was somewhere around there uh it's a little carmelite not not enough you know we want a little more but that's why we're gonna put the onion right now okay we're gonna put the onion and we're gonna caramelize ammonia we're gonna analyze them and the best way to caramelize them is to give them a little seasoning friends okay this is not like my caramelized onion that i make i have a uh a beautiful recipe for caramel donut then you can make a head and freeze it if you haven't seen it you should check it out folks it's really good so you see look we're going to caramelize the onion so we're going to wait for this to happen so it's like texture that is why you see i did not want to uh cook the bacon too much because otherwise by the time my onion caramelizer they're way way overcooked you see so we're going to cook this together we're going to get them golden brown so we're going to come back in a few minutes take your time by the way my heat is like medium high medium high so it's not too high i can control so i don't burn it okay and this my friends it's gonna be delicious so we'll come back in a few minutes again so the video is not a half hour long and i'm gonna put the potatoes we're gonna cover we're gonna cook em for a while and then we're gonna do the steak all right so i'll be back in a few minutes when the onion are nicely caramelized before we put the potatoes all right all right friends so this could take a good three to four five minutes another one three to four or five minutes right uh but i want to show you you see look at the onions are starting to get golden brown you see the golden brown that means they're getting sweeter they caramelize you see and now i don't want to do it completely because i'm going to put the potatoes now and and they're going to cook more so i don't want to come out of them too much but if i did not do this right now if i didn't caramelize them just a little bit right now you know what would happened friends you see right here look we got plenty of colors if i don't do this right now by the time i put the potatoes but there's a food of waters by the time i put the potatoes then um a little bit of peppers for nice colors little diced peppers you don't have them don't worry all right it'll be just fine without it oh yeah this is just for extra i call it and uh get back over here you and um if i don't caramelize the onion before and you put the potatoes you'll never have an opportunity to do it okay so now we're going to put all this together mix that up really good and then salt and pepper again a little salt little pepper and now the secret of my own fries friends besides the fact that they're delicious i got a piece in here somewhere i cover them for the first few minutes yes we're going to reduce the heat we don't want it to go too fast they're going to take a little while to cook and then at the end we'll put a little bit of garlic and then freshly chop acidity now those could take a good seven to eight minutes ten minutes depends how big they are okay and every so often just check them that's all you gotta do you know if everybody's open just give it a good twist like this every so often that's all you gotta do and not worry i put a cover on it so they stay nice and moist and at the end we take the cover out and we get everything nice caramelized so we'll be back in about eight to ten minutes okay take your time relax make sure your heat is not too hot so you don't burn them and you don't have to worry about it too much but everything often like i said just go there pass by the stove and just do a quick little thing here i promise you you're gonna love those they're delicious all right we're gonna let them cook for a little while all right friends we are back remember now these potatoes have been uh doing their thing for about 10 minutes and look at all that moisture that came out of it and it's wonderful that's how we want it we want to keep that moisture so they stay nice and moist and now we're going to finish them up at the last minute uh as we're finishing our steak by putting a little bit of garlic and a little bit of parsley we're going to wait for the last minute and then we're going to put a little bit of fresh black pepper in here and we're going to put fresh black pepper on the steak a lot of people tell you don't put the fresh black pepper it's going to burn nonsense it doesn't burn don't worry about it how much pepper you put in it's up to you the salt we already did it right so now we're going to put the oil and we're using the avocado oil and all you can use your clarified butter i just think you get a better crust with the avocado oil uh and uh and and it's by use whatever you want you can certainly use the um we're gonna do the egg in here and we're gonna do the steak in here we're gonna make sure the pan is hot and we're looking at about 365 degrees steak is going to be very fast because it's very thin you know if you want to do a big steak then you got to go to the oven friends okay but we're not going to do that so this is very thin we're going to cook it right there and we're going to go in and let me make sure i'm in the right temperature i don't want to go in a cold pan friends i want a nice crust okay so i'm going to wait another quick second let me flip my potatoes but there is an amazing flavor and we're going to put the garlic let's do it now there's a little bit of garlic right now i'm gonna put a little bit of parsley and we'll go back and put a little bit more at the end for extra freshness oh a lot of people are complaining they're not complaining like oh my goodness how can i be using his uh his metal uh tong in a non-stick fry pan those folks are made out of diamonds they're a diamond stripe and they're wall and i've been using that frypan right here friends for years that particular one right there ten years and i use metal all the time it doesn't do it doesn't hurt it at all as long as you you know gonna go cut in there you know so we're gonna let them cook let's get the stack ready because now we are probably at the right temperature yes we are we're gonna put the steak remember when you first put it in put it in a pan and don't touch it for a minute now here's what's going to happen it's nothing wrong with flipping the steak if you want but a thin steak like this you want to get a nice crust leave it on let it all leave it alone for a few minutes on each side and you'll get a better crust if crust is interesting to you leave it alone it's going to do its thing perfectly fine now the egg the egg we're going to cook it in um we're going to cook it in butter regular butter friends we don't want it to be too hot i don't want it to be like a blue blue blue blue what the heck kind of any juice is that friends i don't want the the egg to be all bubbled up i want it to stay nice and the best way to do this friends first you crack your egg in a small bowl a cracky egg in a small bowl okay all right and then you take it and you're gonna put it in in your your butter the butter is gonna be about 250 degrees okay you're gonna put it right in there you know what i cracked the egg too harder i just see it right here friends i quite dig a little too hot so i'm going to do another one this is like a one-time deal here show we don't we don't fix things the reality is then if you do it too hard if you do it too hard you crack the yolks and i don't want to see i cracked it right there i'm not doing that all right so i'm going to go in the pan see leave it a steak alone leave it a potato alone boy i heard some crack i don't know where they came from but a little battery in here friends don't be afraid don't be afraid of with butter we love butter around here friends okay and here we have it you have the egg broken we want a perfect sunny side up eggs right so we put it in butter make sure it's not too hot 250 275 you'll see a little bit of bubbling right there right and you take the egg gently friends put it right in there and leave it alone you see leave it alone i said leave it alone i'm moving it around very simple that's all we do we let it cook slowly and then we're going to put it right on the steak the potatoes are amazing they smell just absolutely amazing friends now the steak is probably ready to flip let's see oh yeah oh yeah you see beautiful now depends how you like it cook obviously it could take a little bit longer okay we're going to stop the potatoes give them a little more uh parsley and you out of here say well just leave it alone just like that friends i got the black pepper on the egg we're going to put just a little bit of salt about three four minutes you know i forgot to put my copper on it it's easier if you put a cover then you cook the yolk much nicer all right the steak is going to be really really ready remember this is very thin we don't want to overcook it so we're going to put the steak the steak is is ready it really doesn't take much put a little more pepper on that side we're going to take the see how fast that stick went look you can feel it it's ready we're going to leave it in here just for a second leave that alone the egg is going to be ready let me take a spatula to get my eggs and then we're done we're going to put the potato oh yeah egg is beautiful you see let's put this here right there let's leave it in there for another second so it cooks i think it's perfectly fine right let's make a plate in a plate friends we're going to put our potatoes that are beautifully cooked beautiful potato look at that it

gonna put our onion and we're gonna caramelize the onion all right we're gonna caramelize onion we want some caramelized onion on the dear friends so I'm gonna let them do this I'm gonna let them caramelize for a minute and I'm going to talk a little bit about what I got in there so now I got I got some uh uh ground chuck you can because I got my own meat grinder so it makes it easy sometimes I put chalk ribs in there but I got a ground chuck so I grind it up if you can't get ground chuck could get 80 20 at the grocery store that's fine 80 20 80 lean 25 silly I got some bell peppers I got garlic and I got a few ingredients then uh you probably have in your cupboard somewhere I got my marinara sauce because I got I'm going to put a little bit of mine in our sauce in there uh you gotta do your tomato sauce you know you don't you don't have tomato sauce then then use chopped tomatoes it'll be fine okay now I got a special ingredient right there friends I hope you can find it this is a Arisa Arisa is a is a Moroccan hot chili pepper sauce it is amazing if you've never had a reset before you got to look for it I found it at Whole Food uh I know most grocery store have it in Europe and you get it everywhere in in America I know you can find it but trust me it is amazing it's the fragrance of and how is amazing I'm going to use a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and I'm also going to use a little bit of umamis this is a sauce that is um it's like a soy sauce it's got a little more flavor I got more Umami flavor to it so we're going to use that and a little bit of brown sugar very little normally I said I'm going to use a brown sugar but I forget Oh Mamma Mia look I always forget I got a little bread right there you're not talking about forgetting I'm always forgetting something you know it wouldn't be on my channel if I didn't forget something once in a while but I forget all the time and you know we're having fun that's what it's all about my friends look before I put the meat in there I gotta get the onion caramelized because if it then I caramelize they're not sweet and I want them to be sweet okay so it's very important so friends I'm gonna wait for those guys to caramelize a little bit and then I'm gonna put the the beef in there and we're gonna caramelize it we're gonna get the Maya reaction oh I didn't tell you but I got some beautiful English cheddar I got this amazing English cheddar shredded very very fine I'm gonna put that toward the end because I like it in my sloppy Joe I think it's up to you you know there's so many recipes out there most of them are sloppy mine is going to be not so sloppy friends I'll be back when the audio are nice and golden brown okay give me a minute okay friends enough caramelization I mean if I were to do some dish with Jessica melatonia because but I'm gonna put the meat in there now and guess what it's going to continue caramelizing my onion a little bit too so I don't want them to be too Brown otherwise they'll get burnt you see what it is now very important friends very important then we take the time to caramelize this dude this dude no really very important my friend my friend I'm telling you some people said oh you're calling me friend I feel like my I hope you're my friends I love doing this Channel and and I love it calling you guys friends because I feel like you're my friend you know let me tell you what happened and you guys understand what I'm waiting for this okay remember I had a restaurant for 22 years okay I was in front of the people every night when you put on salt before I forget right uh every night I was running around the kitchen the dining room and then I retired from the restaurant business and I opened up a cooking school okay I ran a cooking school for 21 years with the thousands of glasses thousands of people we had an amazing time every night we had a lot of students that came and came again and again and again they were here open and they become my friends so every night I was used to say hey friends and then coffee it happens and then cover it up and we had to close the school because nobody wanted to be around other people so I started doing the Cooking Channel on on YouTube and then every night I would do it and I would call people friend hey friend because I felt like I was in front of my group so and that stayed with me the whole time and I love it and then and you guys have uh uh appreciated and it's been amazing a lot of fun so God Bless America and God bless you too all right friends look look it's getting there it's getting there I'm not gonna put anything in there I'm not going to put anything in their friends until I see some Maya reaction and the Maya reaction is the colonization of the protein that is going to give us flavor I always relate this into um when you're making a steak you could take a steak and put it in boiling water in a cook right it'll be like that you can take a steak you can put and get a beautiful caramelization on the outside and that's called the Maya reaction it's extremely important then we do that all right also important when you do this to do it in a wide fry pan friend I tell you why because if you do it in the pots when you caramelize the meat the moisture see like right now the moisture the moisture escapes if you do it in a pot a tall pot the moisture stays in the path and it's more like a stew instead of being a commodization so if you're going to do this anytime you need to caramelize make sure you do it in a fry pan where the moisture can escape instead of in the fat all right it's important it's a little detail friends but you know sometimes it's inner detail there is an expression it says something is in a detail I don't know what it is the expression but some of you are going to remember what I'm talking about sometimes I forget what I'm talking about but not now all right look look look I'm waiting for a little more commodization if you don't mind because then I'm gonna put the bell peppers I cut them nice and small you don't want them big you know you don't want any being right and then we're going to put the garlic and then friends we're gonna put all the rest of the ingredients but the rest is moist so and the tomato sauce cooked already I don't need to cook so I just want to get some nice color in here that's all so I'm gonna wait a minute okay all right I'm looking good I got some nice caramelization friends I'm gonna put the peppers I'm gonna put a little bit of brown sugar a little bit a little bit don't eat it a lot just a little bit oh I always forget to tell you about this thing right there this thing in the brown sugar I forgot what it's called I think it's called the uh the the brown sugar saver I don't know what it's called made out of clay it's pretty cool all right now look a little bit of a Worcestershire sauce as long as you measure everything carefully you're good a little bit of umami you know if you don't have it don't worry put a little sauce in there so watch for your salt but this let me tell you is going to give it a beautiful flavor friends and this is a star ingredient right there oh you got to try to find this yeah I'm sure you can find it online friends we're looking good this is very spicy be careful don't put too much of it in there oh no kidding it's spicy friends all right we're gonna put a tomato sauce I got about a what do they say about a cup about a cup of tomato sauce and then we're gonna gently cook this for a few minutes tomato sauce is cooked the meat is cooked everything is cooked so we don't need that much more cooking time you see oh I'm surprised I didn't get any on me yet and at the last minute we'll put a parsley we don't need the pasta here to cook hey hello it is beautiful you see and it's gonna have the right seasoning friends the Arisa if you can find it it's pure waterfall friends I'm telling you I I Amazon Amazon you'll get it and you're gonna go oh my Lord you know if I find a link on Amazon I'll put it in the description for you or wherever I can find it we used to have it in our store all right friends I'm gonna put a cover on it I'm gonna cook it for a few minutes okay just for a few minutes oh let's not forget to put the garlic friends gonna put the garlic in there I don't like to put it too soon you put it whenever you're comfortable but I don't like to put it too soon huh we're gonna continue cooking us for a few minutes and uh we're gonna cook it without the cover now we're gonna add a parsley it's beautiful my friend that's gorgeous look at this all right a cheese my friends let me tell you how I like to add it I like to add a little bit of it now and I when I shave it I shave it very fine very very fine you don't have to add the sheath if you don't want to you know it's up to you I just like it I did sinking melts beautiful you watch it's gonna melt beautiful as long as you get a nice cheddar you see it probably got not just a little more turn the heat off you know you're good let's let the cheese melt and I know we're gonna have plenty of seasoning in there because of the uh of the Umami and because of the Worcestershire sauce and a little bit of salt that I added the beginning you see how it's all sticky together beautiful and my friend this is gorgeous all right so we could wait a little bit so it's not so hot probably should right what do you think and then I had to add more cheese at the end just a little bit oh oh hold on hold on hold on remember I don't want to make a sloppy not too sloppy I should have done this before too big too big foreign got to be a little smaller and then we take it and we'll put it right on there friends now how much you put in is how sloppy you want it to be I don't want it to be too Slappy so I'm going to put very little all right it's up to you how you want to put it in Frenzy it always is don't let anybody tell you nothing and then what I like to do I like to smack it in just a little bit and then I take a little more cheese and this the heat of it is enough to melt that cheese and then I'm going to put my yes it'd be difficult to eat over there right so you see all of a sudden it's not so sloppy anymore my friends what do you think you like I love it I'm gonna test it it's probably too hot what do you think it's

mH8uaWnr4FA.json;- Hey, I'm John Kanell and. today on Preppy Kitchen, we're making a perfectly. delicious roasted chicken so let's get started. First off, preheat your. oven to 450 fahrenheit. Grab a big roasting dish and we're gonna prep our chicken. You should have a three to. four pound roasting chicken and it shouldn't be ice cold. If it is, it's gonna really. have a difficult time baking properly, so just. let it warm up a bit and also drain any juices. that are left inside. You want to pat your chicken. dry with paper towels. It shouldn't be wet because. we're gonna be covering this in delicious things, including butter and I need that to stick. This chicken's had its giblets removed. I actually saved the livers. because roasted chicken liver is one of my secret favorite things that you know about now. Roasted chicken is delicious. and I love the crispy, like, nicely seasoned skin. But you want the meat to be flavorful too. You can't just put flavors on. the outside of your chicken, you have to put it under the skin as well. So, with your clean hands, you're going to carefully separate the skin from the meat. You wanna lift the skin away from the meat without tearing the skin. It's great to keep it intact 'cause it's going to keep. all those flavors in there. So many delicious things will. be placed inside of here. If you tear your skin,. that's okay, it happens, don't worry about it,. it'll still be delicious. Just a little tear, ah. You also wanna lift the skin. away from the thighs as well because it's going to. be flavored all over. We're gonna set our chicken aside, wash your hands very well. and onto the next step. (classical orchestral music). (faucet water running) - [Narrator] Running water. is an important element since it acts to flush. farm material off the hand. - In a smallish bowl, I'm. combining about two tablespoons of unsalted butter with one. tablespoon of olive oil. Gonna melt this in the. microwave over 50% power. And while it melts, I'm. heading out to the garden to grab some fresh herbs and a few onions. We planted a lot of things. in the garden this year, among them onions. I'm using some fresh onions. Fresh tarragon is amazing, so is rosemary. You could use any of your. favorite herbs in this chicken. For this recipe, you want. at least one medium onion, but I love onions with roasted chicken so I'm gonna add one medium and two small. Just giving this a nice slice, it's about half an inch thick. They'll roast up and. they won't dissolve away but they will cook through it and caramelize in all those. amazing rendered juices. You know the best part about. onions fresh from your garden? No tears. Oh my gosh, look. It's like nothing, there. are no tears at all. It's only the onions that have. been in cold storage forever. They're really aged and. they're just so potent. This? Look, nothing. Nothing. It's amazing. Sorry. Grab a head of garlic. We're gonna cut it in half cross ways. Whoa, careful, careful. This isn't garden fresh so. it has all the papery skin. Perfect. Slice a lemon in half. If you're adding any herbs. to your butter like I am, make sure you separate. the stems from the leaves. This will go under the skin too and no one wants to chomp. into like a woody stem. So all the soft parts, please. Oh my gosh. This tarragon smells so good. Highly recommend with chicken. I'm gonna give this a nice fine shop. Every Sunday my family gathered for a big dinner with our grandparents and we would have all sorts of dishes. We'd often have this dish and making it just reminds me of my family. It's like a warm memory to go. with a warm, delicious meal. I'm adding about a tablespoon or so of my chopped tarragon. right into my melted butter. I'm also adding in one and. a half teaspoons of salt and about half teaspoon. of cracked black pepper. All right, stir that together. so it's nice and mixed up. Now for the fun part. We get to rub this all over our chicken, under the skin and over to. I was just thinking like, hmm, should I stitch this skin back together? But it was gonna give some major Nightmare Before Christmas vibes and I didn't wanna do that to you. So get that all in the cavities surrounding the breast,. surrounding the thighs. It's actually really easy and painless if you just use a spoon. to add this in here. I'm also gonna spoon this butter mixture all over the skin, over,. under, in, and out. And now it's time to get. our chicken together. Grab your onion. I'm gonna just have a little bed of sliced onion all around it. My garlic goes into the chicken cavity along with about three sprigs of thyme this will give it a nice aromatic hit. I'm also squeezing one. lemon all over the chicken. A lot of it's going to like just roll off but it's gonna be in the pan as well and the onion will cook in that and it's gonna be really nice. I love making roast chicken because the chicken's cooking. in the skin, in the fat, and it's really gonna. be so moist and tender. And once you just prep. it, it's in the oven, you don't have to worry. about it until it's done and it smells amazing. Pop the lemon halves right. into the chicken as well. You wanna fold the wings under. the body so they don't burn. Now I'm gonna grab some kitchen twine and tie the legs together. This will help everything. cook nice and evenly. If those wings or the. legs were sticking out, they would really burn while the rest of your chicken was. trying to cook through. I have a little bit more. thyme, about three sprigs. I'm gonna lay that around. with the onions as well. Time to wash those hands one more time. - [Narrator] The water. temperature should be that which is comfortable to the skin. - If you wanna make a whole. meal out of this, have at it. You can add little baby potatoes here. You could add like fuyu. persimmons if it's in the fall. So many amazing things. can get roasted here, sliced carrots, everything. If you are adding something. like baby potatoes or whatever else in here, I. will say you should season them and add some olive oil. So a little drizzle of oil. all over those veggies. A sprinkle of salt and pepper. I also pop the chicken. liver into here as well. It's one of my favorite things to eat. If that's weird, you can. let me know in the comments. I think it's delicious, but. some people are like aghast. This is ready to go into. the oven which is at 450. But as soon as you close. that door, reduce to 425. it bakes for about an hour. and 15 to an hour and 30 or until it's golden brown. And a thermometer inserted into. the thickest part reads 165. But don't cut it open yet, we'll talk about that when it comes out. (upbeat music) We're gonna baste this. chicken every 30 minutes in its own juices. We want to keep it nice and. moist and not dried out. Out of the oven in a temp perfectly. My chicken's done cooking,. but it's not ready to touch. It needs time to rest so let it sit for about 20 minutes. All those juices are gonna be reabsorbed and your chicken's gonna be perfect. If you cut it right now,. you'll lose all the juices and your chicken, which is perfect, will actually be dry so just give it the time it needs to rest. In the meantime, you could make a salad, set the table, or kick. your heels up and relax. I'm serving this chicken up for dinner. I've been sneaking bites left and right and I've almost finished. all the caramelized onions and the liver's gone too. That chicken is melt in your mouth tender, packed with flavor. And the potatoes, and the onions are caramelized to perfection. Even the lemon comes through throughout. I hope you get a chance. to make this recipe and if you like this video,. check out my dinner playlist. (upbeat music continues);['segundos']
mmoJG5F8GhM.json;- Hey, everyone. It's Natasha of natashaskitchen.com. We're making chicken. roll-ups stuffed with cheese, juicy tomatoes, and pesto sauce. These taste like fine. dining but the are so easy. We'll start with four chicken breasts and cut each in half length-wise so you end up with eight thin cutlets. Pound each cutlet to an even. eighth of an inch thickness. The easiest and cleanest way to do this is using a Ziploc bag. And if you don't have a meat mallet, you can use the back of a heavy sauce pan. Arrange all of your cutlets. on a large cutting board or you can use a baking sheet. Now season both sides with. garlic salt and black pepper. (jazz music) Carefully flip these over. using tongs or your hands making sure you don't. tear the thin cutlets. Place a tablespoon of pesto. sauce over each cutlet and spread it evenly in the center. Very thinly slice one. large tomato into 12 rings. You'll need two slices. for each chicken cutlet. Sprinkle the tops with. two to three tablespoons of shredded mozzarella cheese. Tightly roll up each cutlet and secure the end with a toothpick. The toothpicks help to keep. these together as they cook, sealing in all that amazing flavor. Preheat your over to. 425 degrees Fahrenheit and place a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat with one tablespoon of olive oil and one tablespoon of butter. Once the butter is done sizzling, add the chicken roll-ups. with the toothpick side up. Sear the roll-ups four minutes per side or eight minutes of total. cooking time on the stove. Now turn off the stove. and sprinkle the tops with your remaining mozzarella cheese and one cup of cherry tomatoes. Transfer to the oven and bake. at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 13 to 15 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked through. My kitchen smells so good right now and I cannot wait to taste this. As always, a little bit of garnish and I like putting fresh basil on here because the pesto has basil in it so it just makes it so. vibrant and beautiful. Okay, now the taste test. This one looks nice and big. Size matters. That's kind of a trend around here, I don't know if you've noticed that. Oh, yum. And a little bit of juices on top and some of those yummy roasted tomatoes which actually add a lot of flavor to the sauce so don't skip them. Wow. Now this is dinner. And a reminder, don't forget. to take out the toothpicks 'cause that's not a fun surprise. Your gusts will not appreciate that one. Aw, it's so tender and juicy inside. Yum, yum. Mmm, mmm, mhmm, mhmm. I'm not even done chewing. Just gonna come out and. say it, it's so good. The tomato inside, too makes. it so juicy and flavorful. And then that pesto. Keep in mind there's just. three ingredients inside here. Pesto, tomatoes, and cheese. But wow, this has so much flavor. It's kind of like a. Tuscany flavor, Italian. It's very good, very good.

Facebook search Caribbean Potter come you'll see what I'm talking about beautiful pictures videos chat the works I posted a picture of mr. barbecue chicken on there and just about everyone was going crazy or that picture trust me it tasted even better than it looked so here we go this is going one more time in the oven I'm gonna put one more quote coat off barbecue sauce on there it's going back in the oven I mean it's safe this is one of those dishes gonna be very quick well not quick but simple because we're gonna put it in the oven for an hour hour and a half or so but here we go barbecue chicken in the oven remember if it's the first time watching me here on YouTube above click subscribe give the video the thumbs up or like it and below is where you're gonna leave me your comments show you boys some love and do those things please in a line oven proof baking this share I aligned it because once we start glazing this and it gets all sticky and everything with the barbecue sauce it's gonna be hard to get clean later on one chicken it's a chicken I cut up here into four pieces into quarters basically they're about three and a half pounds or so of chicken washed with lemon juice and water then I drain it patted dry now you'll notice in the skin is still on it this is going in the oven and I really need the skin to help insulate this while we cook it in the oven you can always remove that skin you don't have to eat it but trust me on this you need that skin on here for that sort of protective barrier on the chicken so it doesn't dry up very simple to put together guys here then my little dish here a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of ground black pepper half a teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice and half a teaspoon of ground mustard dry mustard I'm just going to give that a quick little make up in here there these fellas get to know each other nice and lovely OOP smells nice with that cinnamon and nutmeg and everything and all we're doing it's pretty much sprinkling it all over this chicken off-camera I'm gonna turn it around and do the same thing to the other side and I'm just going to pot it on there as well additionally you can need about four strands or four sprigs of fresh thyme just gonna break that dump it all in there we you can certainly chop it up and do your thing but I like it this week this is going in the oven at 375 degrees 375 degrees for 45 minutes after 45 minutes that's when your favorite barbecue sauce is gonna come in handy this is one of the juiciest oven barbecue chicken you'll ever taste so I'm gonna go ahead season the other side of this and I'm sticking in the oven for 45 minutes at 375 degrees it's been it's been 50 minutes since I put it in the oven 375 we're gonna do a couple things now first off if you notice at the bottom there's any extra fat or liquid what you want to do it's pretty much like this stuff here we're gonna spoon that out cuz you really want this to be dry of any sort of liquid any sort of fat before we start adding the barbecue sauce on there I've gone ahead and I've removed all that sort of liquid fat that was on the bottom off the pan here now I have my barbecue sauce with a brush all I'm gonna do is coat brush the chicken pieces generously because we really want this to really get sticky and gooey and glazed up and juicy and hey it's a wicked barbecue is doing here in the oven no no we're telling your neighbors and your friends cuz you know what let them think it did this for hours and hours and hours slow cooking and the grill outside they will know the difference trust me I'm just gonna stick it back in the oven Oh for 10 minutes then we're gonna take it back out flip it and do the same thing again it's been 10 minutes since it's been back in the oven with the barbecue sauce on it so what we got to do now is flip these pieces over and then we're gonna hit them with some of that barbecue sauce and stick it back in the oven one more time so all I'm doing and brushing it again generously with that barbecue sauce and it's gonna go back in the oven for 10 minutes so it's been another 10 minutes since I basted the other side with the barbecue sauce we're gonna do this one more time so we're gonna flip the chicken over back to the original side we had up at first and give it a nice thick coat of that barbecue sauce stick it back in the oven for 10 minutes nice glaze on it you may want to turn up the heat if you need to turn up the broiler to get it a nice dark golden brown luscious sticky color you're looking for what do you think so I'm gonna flip it over brush it one more time a barbecue sauce back in the yard so all I'm doing now is the final thick coat of barbecue sauce and I remember you using your favorite barbecue sauce the one from the bottle from the jar into the gourmet stuff do you think this one here is a honey garlic Dianna's if those of you in Canada will know what I'm talking about it's a lovely sauce I mean I say it's something quick it's fast we don't need to go ahead and make our own sauce or any barbecue sauce or anything you want this nice and thick and I'm gonna stick it back in the oven Oh for another 10 minutes until it gets nice and gluey and sticky and glazed up it's going back in the oven so remember if you want you can put this on the broiler setting now to really crisp up the skin and everything else but this is it guys it's going back in the oven one more time and I'll give you guys a peek of everything when it's all done it's not a nice the kitchen smells good I'm kind of drooling watching the niceness of this chicken here nice and coated shiny with that barbecue sauce the last couple of minutes I put it to Broyles I got a that sort of nice crispy skin with that barbecue sauce down there now remember we cook this with the skin on so you can remove the skin if you want to but trust me you won't be getting rid of that skin underneath nice juicy moist remember these chicken breasts here trust me on this it's gonna be juicy Chris yeah Korean food calm guys you're keeping me about from having my dinner now but anyways thanks for joining your boy in the kitchen show me some love spread the news Caribbean Pot calm thanks for joining me in the kitchen guys;['segundos']
MtKroHChZnc.json;can I be cooking up a piece of pork loin today and get a beautiful crackling on there now a little while ago I did a video for a pork loin with crackling the thing is I didn't really give measurements or weights or temperatures in the ovens hopefully we're going to cover all that in this video now the first thing is I got this from the butchers and he's actually scored the top of it so what that means is you kind of if you haven't got your scored already asked your book to do it but you just grab it like this and you go down and what you do is you cut into the fat but not into the meat if you cut into the me then it's going to make it dry so you go around hold your hand firmly with the knife and just score it away of a sharp knife until you've cut all these little slits in it and now we'll end up making a beautiful crackling now when you cook your pork loin it's important to have the skin really nice and dry because if you've got nice dry skin it will make beautiful crackling now also when I got it from the butchers I asked them to charring it which is if I just lift this out further back there you know separated the meat from the bone so that just makes it easier for carving later on so I've got the pork loin there it's already timed and Taulbee scored then what we're going to do is put a little bit of oil and some sea salt on there now with the oil you can use any oil you like vegetable oil some primal or on it on now I've got a bit of sort of to mix really of olive oil and sunflower oil just going to put a little bit on tissue because I don't want to put too much oil you just want to put a little bit give it a rub on the outside this all again helps to sort of crisp burn it all out and also help us the salt to stick to it so just put the oil on there obviously you could just do you reach your hands and rub it in but don't put too much oil they get it thoroughly covered all over lips is I've got some see some sounds that I put some in up there and start off by spring on it and then we're just gonna carefully see if we can wrap this all in if you can try and wrap it into those little slits we've made now I'm also going to put some black pepper on there so I'm just going to throw that we need all these sort of things besides really bound wrap this in now I'm going to flip it over and I'm just going to put in a little bit of salt there and it's ready to go in there now next of all I've got an onion I'm just going to shut them off and I'm just going to place those in the bottom there does that make a really lovely gravy later also I tend to put some water in the top my mine the reason I do that is it helped to prevent the pork from shrinking level so when you buy your pork loin from the butchers on the skin if you learnt your crackling if you can have a little bit extra and you know they sort you out they cut piece off there because what I find sometimes especially if you've got a lot of guests around and they all laugh the crackling it just means there's plenty for everyone so you know you can ask him he won't charge you anything for that so get yourself some extra salt pork skin to make the crackling and you'll have loads of pork crackling so we're ready to go now I'm just going to tell you how much this way I'm going to cook it for now whichever pork loin you've got what you want to do is give it a kickstart bit of a boost for 25 minutes just to start it off now to start with 25 minutes I'm going to put it a higher temperature and we're going to put it in a 240 degrees Celsius 475 Fahrenheit which is Get Smart rolling so once you've given it a kick start by cracking on its way then you want to reduce the temperature down now we're then going to reduce the temperature down to 190 degrees Celsius 375 Fahrenheit gas mark 5 now time of cooking that depends on the wine now mine weighs three and a half pounds the formula I use is for every pound of weight you want to cook for 35 minutes so this one weighs three and a half pounds so it's three and a half times 35 minutes which actually comes out 120 minutes it's two hours so I'm in Italy 25 minutes give it a boost at a higher temperature and then we're going to do another two hours at the slightly lower temperature and at the end of it you should have beautiful crackling and really nicely done me never got better they are there for cooking the pork loin and it's looking good in the oven now I've gotten two grams potatoes sort of cooking away there and I'm also going to put the other bit of the pork skin to make some extra pork crackling now I've got the temperature of his top oven again at 190 degrees Celsius the same temperature is the the pork loins cooking at the moment so leave it all cooking make sure you top up the water and the pork loin if you need to now it's about the large 20 minutes cooking its pork loin now with the crackling if you get a bit worried that it's not go noise exactly what you came through for say last 15 or 20 minutes just turn the heat right up to maximum just to give it a really good quick boot so for the last sort of 15 20 minutes I'm just going to turn right up to maximum and get out crackling to bursting so I'll finish cooking the pork loin look at that last 15 minutes 20 minutes on the Pooh's maximum temperature really kind of christened a pan pour crackling so let's take that out and put it on the table look whip delish delish so I'll just take the full going from out in the oven I've transferred it onto a plate the readout crackling that is going to be absolutely delicious then what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to let this tenderize so we're going to leave it for a good 20 30 minutes before we sort of tuck into it now I'm also I'm going to get that other crackling that I found cooking in the oven for about an hour so I'm going to pull that out again put it on the same tray and then I'm just going to cover it all in tinfoil so let's found probably up practically now that's pie you're not that you say can see it I'm just going to zoom out a little bit I'm just going to move this back for for this two beautiful pieces of crackling oh what a gold real color delicious looking so I'm going to cover those up a little bit inform them a little bit to inform for though just take a look at this magnificent beautiful I can't wait to tuck into it then what I'm going to do is offer our color these are just very loosely leave that there and I say leave that for good 20 30 minutes really sort of tender eyes and that's done so now what I

mwc8Yno9wmY.json;What's up guys it's Susie Bulloch from. HeyGrillHey.com and if you're watching this video that means we. already have something in common we both love good barbecue and that's perfect. because it Hey Grill Hey my whole goal is to help you make better barbecue so. you can feed the people you love and become a backyard barbecue hero today. we're making a stuffed pork tenderloin on the grill this recipe is kind of one. of those fun recipes you save for a date night dinner at home Todd and I make it. when the kids are gone we want a nice relaxing evening and we want to eat. food that is a little bit more elevated and the flavors in here are absolutely. dynamite we're talking about bacon cream cheese spinach balsamic red onions and. Manchego cheese this recipe comes in at under an hour start to finish you need. 20 minutes of prep and 30 minutes to cook for this recipe you'll need a pork. tenderloin with any of the silver skin excess fat removed two slices of bacon. chopped four ounces of softened cream cheese 3 ounces of manchego cheese. grated and a half a cup of baby spinach for the caramelized onions you'll need a. whole large red onion sliced 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons. of balsamic vinegar and you'll also need some seasoning we're using my chicken. seasoning you can grab this in my store let's get started in a skillet you're. gonna cook down that bacon pre-heat your cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. and then add in your chopped bacon pieces we want our little pieces of. bacon to cook down all the way and get nice and crispy this recipe is actually. inspired by a salad dish and all I could think about was how much better it would. be if it had bacon in it and maybe it was not a salad but instead it was. stuffed inside of some meat so I turned a very healthy salad into a very. delicious stuffed pork tenderloin our bacon is crispy we're gonna pull it. out of the pan just set it on a paper towel to drain leave that beautiful. bacon fat in your cast-iron skillet we're gonna use it to caramelize our. onions so you want these crispy little bacon nuggets so that when you put them. in the filling they hold up their integrity and you get a nice textural. bite in your pork tenderloin we're gonna add the butter to our bacon fat and then. dump in our red onions we're going to add in our onions and start to. caramelize those you can smell the butter and the bacon as it caramelize. these onions these onions take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook down we really. want them to be super soft super sweet so that when you're eating the filling. you don't get a harsh bite of red onion because that can taste a little bit. bitter you get all of the sweetness our onions are perfect they really softened. and they don't have a lot of that bright purple color anymore now they're really. light brown and they look beautiful we're gonna turn off the heat and stir. in our balsamic vinegar these are looking beautiful they're. gonna be tangy and they're gonna be sweet we're just gonna remove these from. the heat and set them aside while we prepare our tenderloin before we butterfly our pork tenderloin. we just want to make sure it's well trimmed this silver skin right here is. not great to eat and it's really tough so just get your knife underneath remove. the whole things just be delicate cuz you don't want to remove too much of the. meat you just want to get rid of these thin membranes that looks perfect. butterflying a tenderloin can sounds a little bit complicated but it's not it's. just like unrolling a scroll just want to take your knife press your hand down. on the top of your tenderloin and about a half-inch off the bottom just make a. long thin slice and then open that slice a little bit do. it again and just make another long thin slice you just want to drag your knife. parallel to the cutting board so that it stays about a half inch above it you. definitely want to make sure that your knife is sharp for this step. especially right on the tip cuz that's what you're using mostly so just keep. making small slices and peeling back the top of your tenderloin until this last. piece is also about a half an inch thick you just press it flat give a nice space. for your filling when you're finished it's gonna be about six inches wide and. a half an inch thick it's time to stuff our tenderloin time for the filling. we're going to start with our four ounces of softened cream cheese just use. the back of a spoon and press it out evenly across your tenderloin. so maybe cream cheese and pork isn't the most traditional combo but cream cheese. makes a beautiful filling and any stuffed or rolled meats because it just. melts down so nicely and it keeps things really moist the cream cheese is on. there evenly it's time to sprinkle on our manchego. just sprinkle your Manchego cheese on there evenly and then I like to use my. hands to press it down so we have a nice even layer of this delicious melty. cheese beautiful okay next is our onions just. spread these evenly over the whole thing they smell so so good you want to make. sure everything is evenly distributed across the top of your pork tenderloin. because you want the spirals to be even when you slice through it next up are. those baby spinach leaves just try to put those on and close to a single layer. you just want the spinach on top of these onions a nice even layer and now my favorite part bake it. crispy little bacon pieces right on top of our spinach it's time to roll this up one trick that. I use to make this a little bit easier is pre-cut your butcher's twine and then. slide it under your tenderloin before you even start rolling that way you. don't have to worry about holding the rolled tenderloin and getting the string. on there you'll just have them all set you'll need about five pieces of. butchers twine kind of like flossing your teeth here comes the moment of. truth we got to roll this thing up so just. start on one side kind of tuck the filling with your fingertips as you roll. and lift up and roll over instead of pressing down and rolling forward okay. we've got a finished roll now all you have to do is take your pieces of. butcher's twine and tie them not too tight not too loose I love making this recipe for date night. when Todd and I have a night alone without the kids it takes a couple extra. steps but it's really not complicated to make and it tastes amazing it gives you. that nice little elevated fancy feel and then just use your knife to cut off the. excess string our pork tenderloin is stuffed rolled wrapped and tied it's. ready to head out and hit the grill all right. last step before we grill our pork tenderloin is the seasoning I'm using my. chicken seasoning it has the perfect balance of garlic and onion and fresh. herbs to complement all we got going on inside of here that looks good it's time. to get it on our grill grate my grill has been preheated to 375 degrees I'm. putting my pork tenderloin on the indirect heat side of the grill instead. of directly over the coals that way the heat circulates around it more evenly. instead of a high temperature direct heat right in one spot we're gonna flip. this a couple of times during the cooking process it takes about 30. minutes from start to finish so plan every 10 minutes to give it a flip looks. good you're starting to see some browning on the underside of our pork. tenderloin we're ten minutes in we're gonna give it another 20 we're looking. for 145 that's the perfect internal doneness for pork oh this is exactly. where it needs to be time to come off the grill be very careful when you move. this because that filling is hot you don't want anything to spill out we're. gonna take this inside let it rest for about ten minutes so that filling. doesn't spill out when we slice it open all right all that's left to do is snip. these pieces of butcher's twine slice this into rings and eat it all right now. we're gonna slice this into about three quarters of an inch thick slices oh yeah. that looks perfect you can see all of the fillings right inside I love that. you can see each layer of our filling the cream cheese the bacon the. caramelized onions and that spinach you might cut into your pork and see a. little bit of pink it's totally fine we know we cooked it to the correct internal. temperature and we cooked it over charcoal and that can actually add a. little bit of pink to the meat this one yeah Cheers down the hatch oh my. gosh that's so good there's like new flavors all right you guys Todd and I. are gonna enjoy our date night dinner for two we hope you take a chance and. make this recipe at home if you do leave a comment let us know how it turned out. for you even better post a photo on social media use the hashtag #HeyGrillHey that way Todd and I can see it leave a comment on your post and cheer you on. on your way to becoming a backyard barbecue hero see you next time pork drop there we go that was terrible. sorry;['segundos']
NfIL0AGjh00.json;what's up guys welcome back to the. channel I'm going to be making some grouper today for you guys this is a. fish that I actually caught yesterday as you can see in the video and grouper. it's one of the best fish that would catch here in Florida I'm going to be. making baked fish fillet recipe with butter and lemon juice and dump some. seasonings so let's get to it okay guys so the first thing we're going to do. with this fish is we're going to fillet it and then we're going to cut the head. from it to use a fur for our soup and usually to filet you want to begin here and you want to cut along the bone run your fingers through it and with the. tip of the knife you can feel the backbone on the fish let it guide you across that's the spine you want to run. the tip of the knife along the spines you hear it so you don't leave any meat here you want to cut across behind the head. down is a bone here that we're going to actually use for the soup also when I. come down on the other side and around that bottom fin mr. bones as a guide for your life and a couple different ways people do. fillets you can either scale the fish leave the skin on you can skin it this. fish I'm going to leave the skin on I scaled it because I came in late and I. had I just scaled it and got it it put in refrigerator so I could fillet the. next day groupers don't have any fishy taste or understanding or anything like. that and they're real thin it's not like a other fish you know like silk or fish. like that they have actually a very very fishy type of taste in their skin was. smoking do have to skin them or you won't be able to eat the fish. so sometimes to mine a little bit of meat on the ribcage it's. actually when you do a good fillet you want to take the fish up and make sure. that you can see light through the skeleton there's nothing left on the. bones the rest of this stuff can I use your soup we're going to cut the head. and then use that for efficient so now that we have our to clean fillets. there's actually some bones left in here but we want to make sure we get them out. there's the pin bones the run right across here the middle of the fillet you. want to make sure you get those out people I leave them in the manga. personally I don't like it make sure you get right there between just a little strip of bone lay there no bones nothing left on it this one does the same thing so right. between the two fillets these pin bones on the fish they want to make sure you. get them all you can feel them on your finger between the the bottom side of. the fillet and the top run your fingers through you're gonna feel about little. roll bones let's call the pin bones and what you want to do is make sure you. come in with your knife just a little strip cut them off that's basically it now we're going to. take it over wash it off and prepare it for for baking so we're going to do is. cut this delay four equal pieces and then we're going to bake it in the oven next time we're gonna do is we're gonna. take some limes Rae on the bottom of Pyrex to fit our fish set it in you guys. won't have to use grouper for this recipe I mean you can use any fish if. you go to your local fish market and you get yourself some whole fish you guys. can do this recipe without wasting any parts of the fish you could actually use. everything and a lot of the nutrition is it that bone broth like I said to you. guys the fish collagen it's really really good it's great for healing your. you've got your intestines you have an e group and intentional discomfort. collagen is a great thing for that College is also great for your tendons. and ligaments and it's just an overall really really good thing to have as is. fishing or bone broth soup which I'll be doing a recipe on that later on in the. channel but the lines you saw with the fish get a good amount of it using about. one and a half lines for this one some of that I've actually got some clarified. butter over here I'm going to put also over the fish and I'm using Kerry cold. butter and once that's done which is very. simple just basically three ingredients once you got the fillets so I'm using. Old Bay seasoning and dog for you guys that fish your know about fishing you. guys know how good this stuff is most fishermen use old bait from other. recipes if you guys have a try it I highly recommend it this stuff is really. really good for fish whether it's fried or baked like this or if you doing arm. shrimp oil or any of those recipes like that cold day is awesome. and our group of relays are ready to to be baked so basically that's what we. have and then we're going to put it in the oven at 425 degrees for about 15. minutes or so until the fish is cooked through okay guys so basically a grouper. is done use the fillets and we conserve this doing a keto diet you can have it. with cauliflower mash which I'll put the link to that recipe right there above. and you can do it with zucchini noodles or you have it with a salad I have. plenty of different salad recipes keto friendly here on the channel if you guys. want to look for those if you're not doing keto you have this with rice baked. potato however however you like that fish we probably got maybe four. small servings of fish the thing about red grouper is that a lot of it is its. head and bones it's got a very big head for the size of the fish so that's why I. like to use everything I used the head the bones and everything to make fish. bone broth or you know the soup and I try to utilize every part of up that. fish make a really really good soup with that and you guys will see that on. another recipe video that I'm also going to link here so that you have it there's. the final the final recipe done and you guys can try this with just fish fillets. if you go through your fish market and you don't want to do all that cleaning. and all that work and you buy fish fillets you could try this really simple. recipe just lemon butter and Old Bay seasoning you just bake it for 15 to 20. minutes at 425 degrees and you have a nice delicious baked fish recipe that. you could have your doing to eat or any other type of die very high in protein. and very healthy so I hope you guys enjoyed the recipe I'll see you guys in. the next one remember to subscribe and share the channel so we can continue to. grow;['segundos']
OgiNtbwLyhY.json;all right hi guys today we're gonna make some salmon we're gonna do real quick preparation using just a couple of ingredients we're gonna season the fish we're gonna sear it in a pan and then we're gonna make a little sauce with some lemon and some compound butter let me show you how it's done we're using our house seasoning we want to season it from up high that way it just kind of falls away and doesn't get clumpy in one spot we used about a tablespoon for both both fillets of fish we'll bring the fish over here to the tow we're gonna cook it in this pan I've already got it set to medium we're gonna add a little bit of avocado oil this is just gonna help to sear the fish and keep it from sticking well know it's ready because we'll start to get a little bit of Sheen on the on the oil it'll start to move around in the pan I've got another pan over here getting water and to that we're gonna reduce some lemon juice and fold in some butter and that'll be our sauce all right what I'm seeing on the oil is I'm seeing it starts to ripple just a little bit that lets me know that it's getting hot so then we'll add the fish in then we're gonna go flesh going to go flesh side down into the pan first and that's your presentation side because we're gonna serve it skin side down all right while the fish is cooking we'll we'll start making our sauce over here in the other pan it's just a warm pan we've got it set to medium I'm going to turn it up to medium high we're gonna take a lemon squeeze the juice in the pan and on me but in the pan invest all of that foaming is telling me that the pan is nice and hot and that the water is evaporating out okay we're gonna take some of this compound butter and we're gonna begin to velvet the sauce this is cold right now and as that melts into there it's gonna begin to emulsify a little bit and it'll it'll make what's a sauce now you've got to be careful at this point because you're not trying to boil the butter but you want to use the heat to melt it and that's what's going to give it a nice flavor it's incorporating with the lemon juice and making a nice velvety texture and if you see these little streaks in there you want to make sure that you have a couple of those whenever you're finished because if not your sauce is probably going to break on you now at this point I've got most of the butter melted we've got a little clump there I'm gonna remove it from heat I'm starting to get some boiling we're gonna remove it from the heat and allow the heat to dissipate in the pan and that's it your sauce pretty much is ready we'll pour this on top of the fish now we're gonna take a spatula and flip the fish if you notice right here on the side you can see how the color is changing you can really tell on this piece right here how there's a difference in color and what you want to do is click it until this all becomes opaque so we'll let that go we probably looked at about three minutes away from turn down the heat a little bit to medium I don't burn or you don't want to get a birth taste in there and the sauce the sauce has helped together pretty nicely 1:38 in the middle all right we're gonna get some carryover cooking is its small piece of fish we'll remove it we'll place it on our platter over here we'll take this butter sauce [Applause] and just scoop it on hey guys you wanna try some fish you like salmon we're making a video you want to let me know if it's any good alright fresh fresh off the grill or off the pan we did a little butter sauce and let me get you some utensils I've got some spoons right up here [Music] be straight amber tour so we've got a nice pink pink middle they're part of the flavors delicious thank you perfect that's what I like enjoy thanks guys you want to try it and [Music] the lemon with the butter and the Christmas it's just I'm getting barren that's I love my job;['segundos']

Pl4miujXyBM.json;hey guys it's matt with meat church well today i'm crazy excited to be bringing you a texas size colossal surf and turf on what ought to be the first ever cooking video on youtube on the brand new traeger timberline xl [Music] well this is going to be an awesome meal and i couldn't be more excited i've been cooking on this trigger timberline xl for about six months i was in the beta program this one's actually brand new and what i'm going to show you today could apply to any cooker but i've you know got to feature this super sexy new grill never even been cooked on so this meat is going to be the first thing that i put in this grill and look at all this room tons of great new features which i'll talk about as we cook but the number one feature to me it's got an induction burner over here which everybody's been waiting on so we're going to reverse sear this steak today you all know i cook steaks a lot of different ways but why would you not smoke one and sear it here on this induction burner and we're not just talking steak today i mean take a look over here at the size of this lobster tail so for comparison this is a 32 ounce bone-in tomahawk rib eye and it is dwarfed by this lobster that i got from my friends at lobster anywhere i actually paid for this because i wanted to use their stuff it's so good they ship it overnight and i bought a size smaller than this and they sent me this ginormous one knowing what we were doing this is uh this is the biggest lobster tail i've ever seen in my life but this steak shout out to my man jared the market manager at heb in waxahachie he cut this for me this morning this is a prime tomahawk rib eye that looks really good so i'm going to grab some of my holy cow by the way first new feature here or second this pop and lock system rail system on the traeger timberline xl i can put a little caddy here to put my seasonings in i've also got a shelf on that caddy and over here i've got my butcher paper holder totally customizable you can move things around but this is the setup that i dig so i can easily grab my holy cow so we're going to do reverse here today two-step process we're gonna smoke this steak at 250 degrees until it's like 115 120 internal i'm gonna pull it off and with this cast iron i have on top of the induction burner i'm going to sear it get a nice hard crust on the steak by the way love induction because that surface won't get hot when there's not a pan on it so my kids aren't going to burn themselves and it's cast iron which is my favorite way to sear a steak so let me get this holy cow going here get my seal off here and we're going to season nice and simple holy cow is salt pepper and garlic it's a very texas rub it's mostly salt and pepper a little bit of garlic season how you want season with what you want maybe you just want salt and pepper this thing doesn't need a lot of trim because jared hooked it up for us so nice kind of moderate application holy cow is by far and away my family's favorite steak seasoning got that nice big 16 mesh coarse cracked pepper in there i love to leave seasoning on for about an hour uh sitting out at ambient temperature but i'm not gonna wait that long we're gonna wait like 15 minutes today so i'm gonna let this adhere and i'm going to come back and we're going to get to cooking all right guys our seasoning is nice and adhered so let's get in here on the cook so i'm going to put it right here on this middle grate while this seasoning was adhering i went ahead and took the top grate out just so you could see a little better let's talk thermometers you guys are used to these leave-in thermometers this new grill comes with two of these but traeger is sending you two of these wireless meter probes with this grille and actually will support four so this grille can support six thermometers through the app so i love these wireless meter probes i've been using these since uh these guys were a kickstarter way before traeger acquired them and i love this because i can just insert it right here into the middle i'm going to go right in the heart i want that tip right in the heart of the stake i can monitor this temperature through my app so i'll know exactly when it hits 115. all right i'm gonna close this up um we're rocking here 250 degrees let's talk about the cook for just a second you could smoke lower like 225 with super smoke if you want to impart more smoke into your steak you could cook a little hotter if you don't have as much time you go 275 it really doesn't matter it's your preference i'm going good middle of the road smoking temperature 250 degrees with meat church pellets by the way when we fire this thing up you can't help but notice the full color display amazing user experience a ton of fun but we're going to cook this thing probably about 45 minutes we're going to 115 internal like i said and i'll talk to you about that when we come back from that if you want to go higher lower kind of where you want to be so i'm thinking it's going to take about 45 minutes i'll allow yourself an hour so i'm going to go get that lobster ready now all right steaks cooking so let's go ahead and jump into this monster lobster tail i'm just going to tell you right now i've actually never cooked one this big and you know may not be all that practical for you all to cook one this big at home but hey everything is bigger in texas i like to cut the shell open pull the meat out on top and season it this one might take a surgical team to get right so scalpel let's go actually mr meister poultry shears i'm gonna get in here and just cut this taking these shears and just cutting right under the skin right across here under the shell i should say [Music] so i'd like to bring my hands in here under the shell and just kind of release the meat from the shell just kind of all down the sides here so i'm gonna do that real quick and then we're going to pull it out [Music] just kind of release it from the bottom here all right so i've got most of that out [Music] there we go look at that beauty right there man i got to tell you lobster is probably my most favorite food uh this and a gallon of butter and i'm gonna be set for the day look at that all right y'all i'm gonna go get my seafood seasoning we're gonna season her up and then when the steak is done we're gonna put this on all right let's get this uh lobster seasoned up i mean look how beautiful this thing looks we've got our beautiful little lobster curtains like we're about to be live on a broadway show here the show is about to begin all right so we've got our seafood seasoning and our voodoo use what you like um i love voodoo on seafood so i'm gonna do a little light application of this and mostly go with our seafood seasoning our seafood seasoning something we don't talk about nearly enough but it's great on lobster it's got a little bit of a bite to it so i love it okay i'm gonna get here on the sides and then our steak is about ready to come off at which point we're going to crank the traeger up because we want to cook this lobster at a much higher temperature and then it's going to be time to sear that steak and get to eating the best lunch i've had in quite some time all right guys i see the steaks at 115 degrees internal through the app uh and the wireless meter probe so i'm going to pull that steak off and then i'm going to increase the temperature of this grill because i want to cook this lobster around 400 degrees so that it doesn't get rubbery so let's pull the stake out and it looks awesome great color already i'm going to go ahead and crank the temp up i'm going to go 400. people do lobster 350 to 500 higher temperature uh so that the meat doesn't get too rubbery so i'm going to go 400 which is kind of like right in the middle of kind of where i like to cook it and it'll just take about two minutes to get up to temp so i'm going to go ahead and put this in this is going to take a little bit to cook [Music] let's go pretty side out [Music] there we go we're looking for the seafood's 145 degrees so i'm probably gonna pull it by 140 uh you know i never like to overcook my stuff and it'll continue to carry over cook a little bit so here's the timing deal with this cook i'm going to lightly tint this steak with some foil which i have here let it hang out and rest now the tail is pretty big and it's going to take a little bit to cook most of you will probably be cooking a little smaller tail so i'm going to go over to my induction burner i'm going to turn it on i want this cast iron here over 500 degrees to sear this i'm going to give it a few minutes i'm going to turn it on we'll do that together and we're going to sear uh one minute aside and then let this continue to hook we're going to kind of time it to get them both out at the same time so i'm going to let this sit here about 10 minutes before i turn that on i'm going to check this cast iron see where we're at on that and then we'll sear this steak off all right guys before we sear the steak i'm going to baste this lobster often now i've melted down some butter uh with the juice of a lemon some garlic some parsley and a little bit of our holy voodoo and i just i'm gonna keep this nice and moist so i'm gonna baste a lot plus i love butter like i always say here to help you lose weight i'm here to help you enjoy life i'm gonna do this at least two or three times now it's time to get that induction burner and go in here in a second so we can sear all right let's get to this sear so i've turned the induction burner on and i turned it all the way up to 10 which is sear i want to get this cast iron over 500 degrees which it got up to that temp super quick with my thermoworks ir gun we're at 525 that's after i put some oil on it got a little peanut oil on there and here we go yeah if there's ever any questions about if it could sear we've just answered that so let's talk about this cook process on the reverse here i'm a medium rare guy actually a little under medium rare so medium rare is 130 135 internal so we smoked this to 115. i'm gonna sear about 90 seconds aside look at it if i want to go more because i like a lot of crush we might go two minutes you can adjust all this to your liking um if you like a medium steak then i would have smoked that to like 125 maybe even 130 and you know sear for as long as you want to get a really good crust it's going to take a good 90 seconds like i said maybe two minutes but we'll check in with this in just a second and see how we're doing all right we've been 90 seconds let's see how we're doing oh that crust looks awesome that's good with me so back on the other side all right this has been going 90 seconds that looks awesome all right i'm gonna take this over to the butcher block put a compound butter on it and rest it and check on that lobster all right the steak is done so let's check the lobster man that looks awesome oh yeah we're not high 130s one part 140 on another part all right man this uh smells even more amazing than it looks we've thrown a little parsley on the lobster to make it pretty but you know never going to be too mad about a little more butter on there squeeze a little one more lemon man that looks good but we're going to scooch that out of the way let's uh slice this steak and we've let this rest it's been sitting here for probably 15 minutes we put a compound butter with a bunch of herbs in it right here on the top of the you know on the steak that melted over it while it rested well i'll just go this way foreign getting the spineless man that looks so so good i don't know where to go first to be honest with you but i've been dreaming about this uh since we ordered it so probably going right here this makes it nice and easy sitting right up here on top we could just cut the whole thing away but you know i might just give me a little piece right here i don't know about a little piece maybe a maybe a humongous piece look at that man it smells so so good ah that's gigantic maybe a little little butter dip that's amazing going for the forbidden second bite man i love lobster that i really like the seafood combination of the seafood seasoning combination of the seafood uh in the voodoo on it but basted in that butter it's just like super rich and decadent and that's probably the last meal on earth candidate for me um let's just jump right in here to the stake so good system well heck i don't need a dang knife what am i doing super simple and super delicious ah that's good that was too easy on that brand new sexy grill but dude you can't be this colossal texas surfing turf with the biggest lobster i've ever seen in

pvMMkJpMyxo.json;well hello there friends very special video today we cooked the chateaubriand filament for two stay tuned i'm gonna show you exactly how to make it remember thumbs up if you liked the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it together well hello there friends wonderful steak today i'm gonna show you how to prepare a double filament uh let's call it the chateaubriand years ago in the in the 70 in the 80s running a french restaurant this was one of the most popular items we had at the restaurant and we used the technique that was called a reverse seal we had another shame the oven special for that where you pre-cooked the meat at 200 degrees so 200 degrees doesn't really cook it just cooks a little bit of it right and then you let it rest and then when you have an order you pop it in the fry pan and you finish the sear it's called the reverse seal so instead of searing it at the beginning to get a golden brown and then pop it in the oven to cook it we're going to do the other way around we're going to cook it first then we're going to pan sear it all right and we're going to do it so like i said years ago these to be called i'm sure in so many restaurants you can still get it it's a perfect roast for two perfect romantic dinner so we're gonna do it right there so what did we do to prepare this thing first of all let me tell you i take a second mortgage and a house for this thing tenderloin beef today oh my goodness expensive like wow i can't believe how expensive it is so we gotta save up for this but it's worth it all right so what i did is uh i i if you have the time get it ready put it on a rack like this salt it all the way around it and leave it air dry in air not cover no plastic nothing put it in the fridge for 24 hours if you have the time if you don't have the time do it one hour before it's still going to help you get a better quest the idea is to dry and to salt to the inside so then it's nice and salty already and it's nice and dry because you see what happened is is because the process of osmosis they it pulls the moisture out and then slowly it goes back in and season the meat you'll be amazed you don't need to put salt anymore it's already seasoned if you do it that way at least an hour before you know you're going to do it so put it on the rack it's well worth it all right so now all we're going to do is we're going to put some black pepper in there that's all we're going to do you can see them with black pepper because we already season it with a salt and my my pepper mirror is oh here you go it's functioning finely and that's what we're gonna do you see just like this and then so now you know by the salt you know about the pepper so how do we get it now without having to worry too much about it how do we get how do we know it's going to be 120 degree on the inside well the best way to do it friends is to use one of those thermometers there's some wireless one i've never used them so i don't know if they're any good so i'm not going to say it but you go right in there friends you poke it right in the middle of it and you go the idea is to poke it and go right in the middle about up to here and right in the middle here so we're going to go in there and we're going to stop and we're going to be about right there in the middle okay now we're going to put the thermometer to let us know when it's 120 125 degrees depends how you like it cook i like my medium rare rare so 120 122 123 degrees it's going to be perfectly fine we're going to take it out we're going to let it rest and after it has rested then we're going to pan sear it and then we're not going to lose any precious juices okay that's all there is to it friends we're gonna go right in there pop it in the oven i love this system this uh thermometer that we have pour it right in here take the wire out put it right there on the outside of your oven you see boom boom right there turn the alarm on it'll tell me when it's 122 degrees for this one so i let it cook uh after that where it's wanted take it out and you'll see we're going to take it out together we're going gonna pan sear it then we're gonna make a little reduction we're gonna serve it with a fondant of potatoes and um and some mixed green beans green and yellow beans all right we'll be back in a few minutes friends when it's out of the oven okay folks i don't know if you can hear but it's beep beep beep that means we're ready to go 122 i put a 122 by like a rare so if you like a little more cook friends you want to certainly cook it a little bit longer and you see when you take it out let me close these guys mamma mia that's alright i'll pick it up later um you see it looks uncooked it looks strange when you look at it right it looks it looks kind of strange but don't let the look fool you you know don't don't judge the book by its cover and i say something like that um so we're gonna let it rest now no matter what we we need to let food rest anyway so especially meat so it's a really cool thing because we need to let it rest so uh we're going to let it rest about 15-20 minutes in 15-20 minutes we are going to uh paint sear it and we're doing a cast iron pen and really gives it a beautiful crust and uh and and then i'll make a little glaze uh i have a madeira i'm gonna just just deglaze the panda and and make a little glaze and let it rest a few more minutes uh i'm gonna serve it with a fondant potatoes and i already made those potatoes there's a link in there somewhere i'm not sure it's over there or over there it's in there and there's a link we already made this we release them they're fondant potato they're amazing serve them with any potato you want i'm just going to increase the temperature on my on my oven because i added really low obviously a two and a quarter um and we're gonna get here reheat those potatoes three three fifty they were in the fridge we already made them and uh and then that's it so we'll be back in a few minutes let this guy rest about 15-20 minutes that's a really cool thing if you have a dinner party especially if you have a romantic dinner you got to plan the whole thing right and uh and it's perfect you can relax you can have the appetizer you can have more champagne more wine you know and uh and uh and then you'll finish it and right here we're gonna do it few minutes sorry so i'll be back in a few minutes okay friends well these guys rest about 15-20 minutes so i'm gonna seal it i got a cast iron pan then i'm gonna get really really hot 365 is all i really need right here i'm going to do some green beans you see i got regular butter in here and as you can see the milk protein is starting to uh to caramelize a little bit so i'm just going to put them in here like this just regular butter shallots right and and i got green beans i got green and yellow beans we're just going to saute them with a little butter we have a video also where i make green beans with sun dried tomatoes and things this link is over there somewhere you can get it if you want to do a different one than this this is real simple all right so we're going to make sure we're at the right temperature we don't want to go in a cold pen that is for certain and we're going to take our fillet right there and we are going to give it a beautiful seal okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a very simple pen sauce just to get something if you don't want to make a salt if you do want to make a sauce friends there's a lot of sauce recipe on our website on our website on our channel okay if you click on sausage you see there's a bunch of it there's a mushroom sauce that will get great in there there's a lot of sauce in there also when i did a pork tenderloin i made a port wine reduction that would be perfect for this really really beautiful we're going to put a few garlic cloves in there just for flavor yeah it's gonna give a little flavor and then at the end i'm gonna put a little bit of rosemary and thyme and uh really simple i got some madeira i'm just gonna deglaze with a little bit of madeira very very simple okay and little shallots i'm not gonna put them now otherwise they're going to burn i don't want to forget to tell you that it took one hour and 22 minutes for my temperature to get to 122 degree horrid ironic ironic so um but uh you know it could take you anywhere between an hour and 15 minutes and 20 minutes depending on the size my friend depending on the size of it okay so we are going to uh to get a nice seal on it and uh and that's all we want at this point just get a beautiful seal that's all and we're gonna do this take our time there's no rush okay and we're gonna sear the green beans to make sure they're good let me get a spatula here for the green beans right there you see and the green beans are going in and the green beans are cooked they're already cooked in water green and yellow beans i guess they are cooked some of them are too cooked i can see that and all we're going to do is just going to get them hot a little bit that's what we're doing let's uh we're starting to get a nice seal on there in the back of it we are the the mark of the of the grill the garlic is gonna get burned but we don't really care we're not using it i mean we are using it for the flavors and here we have the green beans they're done i put the potato in the oven let me check and make sure they're good yeah they're gonna be perfectly fine the place is getting smoky because uh that's the name of the game it start and i did it in clarify butter yes i told you that already just got to make sure you really get a nice crust and we're gonna use the font and we got in the bottom of this band to do a little wine reduction so i can put now my shallots that i'm gonna use if you don't have shallots you can just put onion it'll work just fine i got enough of a a nice crust around it now i am going to deglaze this with my madeira port wine madeira will work just fine i'm going to put some fresh herbs in there i have a thyme and uh and uh rosemary i'm gonna deglaze that pork wine madeira fortified wine is perfect for this really simple friends nothing complicated i'm going to add a little bit of stock because i love a little bit of stock on there a little bit of broth you don't have to use broth if you don't want to use broth friends but a little stock in there it's gonna make a nice reduction you see very simple beautiful reduction simple simple simple you see and now we're gonna finish it up with butter but if i don't want to lose all of it because i may lose all of it if i reduce it too much i'm going to put a little salt and pepper in there now because you know my stock doesn't have any salt remember right salt i don't have any salt my stock doesn't have any salt so i'm going to put a little bit of a cornstarch in here i mean you can't wait to reduce it down damn it you have nothing left if you want some sauce and right there you got a nice piece of meat you should have some nice sauce to it you see and uh if we do that we're going to put it in here just a little let me get a little whisk friends and then we are ready to eat almost so mama mia i'm going to the wrong drawer there you go there you go just a little bit all i want just is just a little bit let me make sure i get back

qeX4jE52yQk.json;foreign [Music] hope you all are doing well in today's video I will be sharing a recipe for Chinese style fried chicken I already have two recipes on my channel but I figured I'd do it again and address all the questions I had in the first video you know people was asking a lot of questions and you know in this video I'll address all of that now what I did was brine the chicken first this part is very important because if you skip this step your chicken will be Bland basically so I brined the chicken first but I didn't get to show it apart because I decided on the last minute to actually share the recipe again so I brine it in sugar salt and water I will leave all the correct measurements and ingredients in the description box then the next day what I did was rinse the chicken really well and now we'll proceed to The Next Step so for the ingredients I have here some soy sauce I have some housing sauce I'll be using some star anise I have garlic ginger green onions or scallions I'll be using some Chinese five spice some chicken powder or chicken bouillon and some white pepper you can use black pepper if you like so to a large pot I did add about 10 cups of water and will go in with the soy sauce now it will look like a lot of soy sauce but it's really not for you know to give that chicken the flavor you need a lot of soy sauce so we will add all the ingredients here and we will mix well and we'll allow it to come up to a boil or a simmer before we add the chicken next you want to add the chicken and you want to allow it to parboil for about 20 minutes once the chicken is nicely parboiled we'll wait until the water starts to actually boil before you start counting the time down okay and once your chicken is parboiled for 20 minutes it will float up to the top that's how you know that it's time to remove the chicken once it floats up like that we'll remove it and we'll place it on a wire rack to drain you do not want to fry your chicken when it's wet so allow it to drain off and then before you actually place it into the oil to fry it you will Pat it dry with a paper towel so one of the questions I got was can we use the broth that the chicken was boiling in and yes you can reuse the broth what I did was added it to a small saucepan and then add some corn starch to thicken it and it can be used as a dipping sauce for the chicken once you add the corn starch in there and it thickens you turn your heat off and set aside now if it seems a bit too salty before you add the cornstarch you want to add a little bit of water to dilute it and yeah it can be used now we will proceed to Frying the chicken we will fry it in oil and we will be using the airfryer because another question I got was can we use the airfryer for the chicken and the answer is yes you can use airfryer so now we will add two of the leg quarters to the airfryer and I have it preheated to 375 we'll cook it for about 12 minutes and this is how it looks once it's golden brown the skin is nice and crispy you can remove it and place it on the wire rack to drain before we cut into it and see what it looks like and remember that the cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken so bear that in mind now this is the chicken once it is all done the one on your left is the air fried chicken and the one on your right is the chicken that was fried in actual oil now they tastes exactly the same once I cut into it the only difference I will say is the air fried chicken the skin was a bit more crispy than the other one but it was absolutely delicious it was juicy tender moist and flavorful and I did serve it up with some vegetable chow mein and sweet and sour shrimp it was delicious my entire family enjoyed it and I hope you all give this recipe a try if you enjoyed the video don't forget to give it a thumbs up share it and leave a comment down below I will leave all the ingredients that I use down in my description box and I'll see you all next time thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and enjoy [Music];['segundos']
qHl1MoXPXz0.json;what a feast the ultimate fish and chips you're going to want to watch this one people well that is incredible for me they had a perfect chip i mean the fish is crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside just do a double triple check on the chips yeah fish and chips my national dish listen i couldn't do it justice before but now i'm gonna smash it out the park because we're gonna pay a lot of attention to the finer details of getting this right first up the perfect chip you make your chips we're mary's piper potatoes you got me don't choose another maris piper let's peel them i don't stress about getting all the peel off you could actually make these chips with leaving the peel on next up get them sliced up and dropped into some cold water now i don't worry about getting perfectly same sized chips but on the whole they're the same so there is a little bit of trim and that's fine [Music] now put the bowl under a running tap and let it run for three or four minutes just to get rid of all the starch get the water nice and clear again now get the chips into salted boiling water okay so you want your chips on a gentle tickle yeah you don't want them boiling really rapidly you just want them on a little tickle because we're going to boil them until they're almost falling apart and they're really fluffy i'm going to pull them out these look pretty gnarly right and they're actually really delicate straight out the hot water but they're perfect because those gnarly bits when they go into the high oil will become so crunchy and so crispy they will be the perfect chip so delicately on to your tray let them cool down and then we're going to whack them in the fridge so i did these yesterday and now they are absolutely perfect you want to have some time you want them to sit in that fridge for as long as possible so they become really quite firm again like that was a delicate chip when it went in yesterday but now it's holding together well we're gonna fry these in beef dripping okay so uh the lovely people at farm sent me some beautiful beef dripping which is what we're gonna fry your chips and your fish in so let's get it into our fryer and then we can start frying okay so i'm going to fry a couple off just to do a test fry to check that i've got the oil right okay now just come and have a look at these beauties now these are oh [Music] oh so crunchy but what they've got is they're nice and fluffy and soft on the inside but they're really crunchy on the outside oh mate oh can't stop eating them okay they are perfect let's get the rest into the fryer and then we can crack on with a fish so those chips have now been in the beef dripping for about six minutes they got nice and golden at 150. i'm going to let them sit there and calm down i'm going to turn the oil up to 180 and then i'm going to drop them in for a second fry right now fish and chips it's a white fish coley cod pollock halibut whatever you really like i'm using classic cod one of the key things that you need to do is you need to lightly salt it and you do that for two reasons one to season the fish but you do it an hour before to bring out some of that moisture to firm the fish up so let's set that aside and crack on with the batter we're going to make the batter for the fish now getting the batter right makes or breaks this dish i'm going to use an ipa from one of my favorite breweries and that flavour is going to really help the batter we're also making a beer batter we're not making a tempura batter it's quite a heavy batter so let's get this right by starting off and sifting some rice flour one third of rice flour to two-thirds self-raising flour and we sift it to get air into the batter [Music] okay then yeah that's beer it's beer okay so now we're going to gradually add this in [Music] okay now this is a piston tip but we want some vodka in there it's got a high alcohol level so when it hits the hot oil it evaporates immediately and makes the batter super crunchy so you want about 25 mils of vodka into the batter okay so it's really all right um you want to have double cream consistency where it's ribboning that's perfect now let's get the fish out the fridge okay so the fish now has firmed up really nice you can feel that it's more robust so what i'm going to do now is i'm just going to take the skin off this card with a filleting knife so there we go no meat left on the skin now brim this down then just with your finger run it through the fish and you'll notice that there's some little pin bones tiny little bones in there just grab them tweezers works best but i haven't got any and just pull them out and just getting those out of the cod so i'm now going to portion this into two i want nice big fillets so i'm just going to cut them on the slant in half season some plain flour with a little bit of salt just mix that in and then i'm going to take the cod dip it in the flour so that it allows the batter to take to it right moment of truth so get your cod dip it into our batter let it drain any excess and then when it starts dripping hold it in to your beef dripping just let it start frying and then let it in and bombs away and we've got that at 150. two quintessential accompaniments were fish and chips tartar sauce and mushy peas now tartar sauce follow this so i've got three anchovy phillips that are finely diced up i've got four nice sized gherkins and the same amount of capers and they've all been put into the bowl now i'm gonna add a good chunk of diced banana shallots a load of flat leaf parsley that's been finely chopped add those in and then i've got these um boiled eggs that are just gooey on the middle dice those through and get that in it's a bit messy but that's absolutely fine i'm just going to put about four good dollops of mayo in there zest a lemon you just want half of that lemon in there and then i'm just going to slice it up and squeeze a little bit of that in then you want some salt pepper and then we're just going to bring all those ingredients together and there you've got super chunky super tasty tartar sauce now let's crack on with the mushy peas next up mushy peas now not everybody will know about mushy peas because it is quintessentially the british accompaniment it's delicious it's simple and we're going to do it with some beautiful mint which is best mates with peas so first off i've got some banana shallots which i've diced i'm going to fry those in some butter drop some frozen peas into boiling water bring it back up to the boil and then drop a good bunch of mint in there cook until the peas are cooked then drain let's get the peas in with the shallots [Music] okay so you've got your butter your sweet shallots your sweet beautiful peas now we're gonna get some freshly sea salted salty happiness yes that is a term uh we're gonna get some freshly cracked pepper in there and then you want about two tablespoons of double cream and we're gonna mush that in you don't have to put the double cream in i do to make it just really indulgent that's a great side order anyway to go with anything okay now i'm gonna mush everything down [Music] okay so get yesterday's paper get that ready because in the uk fish and chips is traditionally served in yesterday's newspaper and then we're gonna go and get the chips to drop on [Music] okay now i've dropped it onto some kitchen roll just to get rid of the excess fat and then let's get it onto the chips [Music] how amazing is that bloody feast i can't wait to get stuck into it oh how much how much come on come on how much listen i reckon it's 650 all flipping down but if you're loving it then subscribe to the channel increase the peace come down and spread the love of food busker what

crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside chips are really crispy could we say these are the best chips you've ever had they're like crispy you think they're too oily a little bit yeah not for me i'm

QmAyXvU_RnM.json;if you want to enjoy something delicious but you want it very quick and easy this is the recipe you should go for keep watching ahead because this one is absolutely savory [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hi guys and welcome or welcome back to my kitchen cooking with claudia here and today in my kitchen or on the menu we have some baked fish filet if you're new here a very very special or big welcome to you to my returning subscribers thank you so much for all the support but if you haven't yet subscribed please take a moment to hit the subscribe button and trust me any recipe i drop here is going to be the bum so to dive into the recipe we're going to start with the ingredients here i have a cord feel it but in this recipe you can use any fish fillet of your choice i just love using cord cut is one of my favorite fish filet the ingredients right here have some parsley and seasoned salt fish seasoning if you don't have the fish seasoning use any of your all-purpose seasoning of your choice i will be using some freshly cracked black pepper for a little bit of heat some chili flakes i have italian seasoning right there but that's too much i won't be using all of that some smoked paprika and garlic powder i'm using smoked paprika because i want it to have like a smoky flavor so first off you have to by dry the fish as much as you can to get rid of all moisture or extra water from the fish the next thing you have to combine all the seasoning together so at this point if you have the already ground or powder black pepper you can add it in here but i wouldn't be using that because i'm using the freshly cracked black pepper for my pepper grinder i will be applying generous amount of the black pepper on the fish fillet that's both sides then i'll just pat it so it really adheres to the fillet perfectly so the next thing we have to do is to season our fish fillet like i said before you can use any fillet of your choice so season both sides of the fillet so i prefer putting or adding oil when i already put the seasoning on it i don't like mixing the seasoning with oil at the same time so i just put the oil on top of it so to create a barrier between my fish and the pan i'll just put some lemon slices under there so that the fish fillet does not stick to the bottom of the pan because sometimes it's really really so annoying when you want to take off the fish from the pan and part of the fish or all of the fish is stuck or in the pan right now it's going to go into my preheated oven 400 degrees fahrenheit for 10 minutes and after 10 minutes tada you have a beautiful meal like this recipe is time saving you don't need a lot of time to prep or whatsoever just season and put in the oven and fully served it's looking so beautiful now you can serve this with whatever side you like i just garnished with some dry parsley and let us try it and see how oh my god the flavor is so beautiful and see how it tastes and there you go you can see how it's very flaky see that whitish inside it just breaks you look at that it means the fish has been cooked to perfection guys i hope you will try this recipe and if you get to try this recipe please comment leave me a comment in the comment section and let me know how it turned out but for now i'm gonna leave you here until meet again in my next video bye for now and keep trusting my recipes;['segundos']

some beautiful short ribs so i gotta cut them up i'm gonna cut them up in little pieces and i'm gonna grind them myself i like them much better than buying meat already grounded so what i got to do is just turn my guy on and voila [Applause] this is dead my friend i'm going to do all this i'll be back when it's all grinded up and we're going to start the recipes i'll be back in a few minutes after i'm done because we don't want to hear that machine for the next few minutes i'll see you in a minute all right friends now that everything is ready let's get going i love making this i grew up on it my mom used to make it in french we call it so uh and i don't know where the shepherd's pies come from and i'm not gonna worry about telling you because i don't know hey you go online and you read it's like 17 different opinion away comes from so we don't care we just want to eat some good mashed potato and ground beef or ground pork or ground lamb however you want to make it it's good with me as long as you're happy i'm happy hey guys i got clarified butter you don't have to use clarified butter you can use a good cooking oil but clarify butter i don't have to worry about burning it and i love the flavor of butter so if you don't know how to make clarified butter friends there's a link down there in the video it says show more click on it and we'll have a link about how to make clarified butter okay and it's better than the milk protein has been removed like i said i got two two and a quarter pound of short ribs you can do ground beef you can do ground lamb you can do whatever you want uh the short rib are perfect they got the perfect amount of fat we're going to saute them here and get some malala reaction okay you could do everything in one pot i like to do it in two parts so it goes faster we got some diced onion we got some sliced portobello mushroom we got some diced carrots and and and then we got some tomatoes i got a can of 28 ounce tomato i use lava tomato crunch tomatoes i got about a quarter cup of tomato puree i got some thyme i got some rosemary and i got some garlic and i got some peas for those of you that don't like pea just don't put them in don't worry about it i'm not gonna be there you're gonna be just fine let's check to make sure we have a good 365 degrees we don't so you know what we're going to do we're going to wait for a second until we get there because uh i don't want to bore you to death with too many stories i got a little bit of beef stock here just in case we need it so we're going to wait a few seconds for the heat to be hotter because it's not hot enough so i wait you got to make sure you're hot you got to make sure you're hot for if it's not hot enough of a temperature it's not going to work so we're going to caramelize the onion right here you know the onion always number one huh oh my regular here it goes again no no no i'm just going to say it one time that's it always always number one in the onion and um and then the beef the beef the pork the lamb whatever it is you're using you got to make sure your pan is hot otherwise you're not going to create the mala maya reaction maya maya maya reaction what is my reaction it's a combination of protein right there folks we're going to get some extra flavor we want to get a golden brown okay i see too many recipes friends when people do this even when you both do a bolognese sauce you want to get some caramelization that's flavor it's called maya reaction we're going to use a garlic salt i got an amazing garlic salt this garlic salt is fantastic we're going to put it everywhere because we need a garlic salt we're going to put some coarse black pepper of course black pepper and let's put it here through the cauliflower right we're going to caramelize the onion so yeah i see too many people that do this recipe and and what happened is their meat is stewed stewed the meat it's kind of like you took a new york shrimp and and you're cooking in boiling water yeah yeah it'll cook you know what i mean right so we wanna get some color caramelization so we're gonna get this okay and then the onion same thing so this is going to take a few minutes before it happens so i'm not going to bowl you to death we're going to continue doing this when this is golden brown this guy's going to bump we'll come back and we'll put the whole thing together we're going to wait because we cannot rush this if we rush it we're not going to have any guys call it a nice collar when you make a bolognese sauce you got to do the same thing all right so we'll be back in a few minutes golden caramel and and go on brown meat all right friends it's taking a little long time for the uh for the meat to caramelize but it's okay we got a little time the onion of caramelized i'm not gonna put the mushrooms because i want the mushroom to release their water so we're going to do that we'll put the mushroom in there we're going to put it on salt and we're going to wait for that to happen so it's kind of like a um take your time kind of dish to make we want to make sure everything is cooked want to make sure that mushrooms are cooked takes a little while to cook want to make sure everything is done correctly the meat is not caramelized yet and i want to wait until it caramelizes before i put more ingredient in there i don't want to put more moisture if i put more moisture then i'll do it like everybody else does i'll stew the meat instead of getting the maya reaction which is so important remember it's very important so we're going to wait a few more minutes for this okay and then we'll continue adding more ingredients all right so we'll come back in a minute okay friends check out the meat you see we got some nice color in it and uh the flavor of it is amazing you see we got some nice color not big caramelization but good enough for us to continue cooking the recipe the mushrooms have released all of their water we are now going to put the carrots in here and continue cooking this until the carrots are tender until the cows are tender and right here my friends we're gonna add the tomatoes we're gonna add our tomatoes right here we're gonna add a tomato puree in here and we're gonna cook all this down we're gonna put some rosemary and thyme cook all this up let's check this it's a constant i mean to mix everything

RxrwUQ4Fl8k.json;hey everybody I'm tamesha and welcome back to my kitchen happy Sunday to you all and thank you so much for joining me in my kitchen as I show you how I am preparing our Sunday dinner for my family so today I'm going to show you how I make a delicious oven roasted lemon herb chicken I want to show you how to get that nice beautiful crispy brown skin wow that chicken is so juicy and moist on the inside so let's go ahead and get over to our other than get started all right you guys so I already have my oven preheated to 350 degrees and I am starting with a six pound chicken so when you cook your chicken you want to cook it on 350 degrees for 20 minutes per pound so I'm gonna actually put my chicken in the oven for two hours but I'm gonna actually be honest I'm gonna put it in the oven for two and a half hours because I don't play with raw chicken so I need to make sure my chicken is done all the way so my chicken is already I already cleaned it well you want to start with a fully defrosted chicken I should say that first but my chicken is clean I trimmed it just a little bit took off some of the extra fat I did leave some on for the pan drippings when we cook it and clean out into cavity so let's talk about the cavity on your whole roasted chicken so sometimes people are intimidated to cook a whole roasted chicken because of the cavity and because of the package that comes in the chicken so in that package you know some people might think is an inconvenience but that package is actually a blessing you guys because you can make a gravy out of the pack that comes in the chicken with the giblets and you know all the the innards of the chicken I know it sounds girls to talk about but don't be discouraged if you have that pack in your chicken you can actually use it to make a delicious gravy I know it's delicious because that's how I grew up with my parents using that the pantry bins to make a gravy but we're not going to use our package today I actually just cleaned out the cavity that cavity is what we're going to use to infuse our lemon and our herb flavor throughout the entire chicken so we're going to hit this chicken with our spices and our seasonings from the cavity we're also going to season underneath the skin and we're going to massage and season the entire chicken as a whole so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start by getting our vegetables into this pan so and I'm just using a heavy-duty skillet that I just lined with aluminum foil because that's what I have I didn't actually have a casserole or baking dish for this but you use whatever you have you can use a Dutch oven you can use a cast-iron pan for this to cook your chicken if you want to you can even cook it in a crock pot as well just keep in mind if you do cook it in a crock pot you're not going to have that crispy skin but that chicken is actually still going to be super delicious and moist and flavorful for you so we're going to place our chicken on top of these vegetables when we cook it after we finished season our chicken and when I don't worry about seasoning our vegetables because all of the juices that are going to cook down from the chicken are going to season our vegetables for us so let's get started on seasoning her up alright guys so what I'm doing now is salt seasoning the inside of our cavity with salt and crushed black pepper so that's what I have in this container and this stuff is actually important because you want to make sure that your chicken is well-seasoned and using that cavity is important because it's going to your chicken cut flavor from the inside out okay so that is good so what I have in this bowl here this is what we're going to use to massage our chicken so I'm starting off with four tablespoons of butter I have just a little bit of salt and pepper in here as well I also have some fresh parsley I have one tablespoon of Italian seasoning one tablespoon of minced garlic 1 tablespoon of granulated garlic I also have one tablespoon of onion powder one teaspoon of paprika as well as one teaspoon of sage and I also have some sprigs of fresh thyme so we're going to get this mixed up and this is going to be what we're going to use to season our chicken from the outside and my butter has to sing out for a little bit so it's nice and softened alright so our butter is nice and mixed up well with our spices and fresh herbs so we're going to just take this this is the part you gotta get down and dirty with and don't be don't be scared you got to give her a nice good massage you gotta show her some love and get all in every single crevice lift her wings up you want to make sure that your seasonings is well coded all over your chicken and right here this is another thing that I like to do see where you can kind of put your fingers in here I want to take some of that butter and go in underneath the skin as well and just kind of when you push to push the butter in just come from the top and kind of spread it through the other side as well just push it in and just smooth it out all right so I'm going to give her a nice massage give her all the attention she needs coat every single part of the chicken and then we come back I'm going to show you how to stuff our cavity all right so our chicken is nice and seasoned what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the cavity and with one tablespoon of minced garlic now you can definitely use fresh garlic for this but I have minced garlic so that is what I'm working with today set that to the side and in this bowl I have one medium onion that I just cut into fours as well as two large lemons that I've sliced up and what I do that you can see on the lemon I actually I've done this whipped a whole lemon without taking the skin off sometimes and sometimes with a large lemon it can be a little extra bitter for my taste so I didn't remove all of the rind from the lemon I just went and slice some of it off just so to keep it from being having a bitter flavor to it but we're going to take our lemon as well as our onion and I also have a sprig of rosemary and we're going to stuff the cavity of our chicken with this and this is where your flavor infusion comes in so I'm going to get all of this stuff in and then when I'm finished with that we're going to transfer our chicken over to our pan that we're going to roast it in alright guys so here is our chicken nice and seasoned and our cavity is stuffed with our onions and our lemons as well as our rosemary so at this point you could you could tie your legs off with some kitchen twine I generally just let her fly freedom when I cook it but what that will do is to ensure that your legs are not cooking faster than the rest of the chicken so that it's they're not overcooked but what I am going to do is I'm going to get this tensive or the piece of foil for the first hour just because I don't want my chicken to dry out it's Betsy up breasts so then have it sit for the first hour and then the last hour and a half of cooking I will remove the foil tent and um let it do the rest of the cooking and then it will be done so I'm going to get us into our oven for two two and a half hours and then when we come back I will show you our delicious crispy Brown flavorful and moist chicken all right guys so our chicken is out of the oven it's about two and a half hours later and what I'm doing right now is something that I did throughout the baking process it's just basically taking the pan drippings and basing our chicken with it so you want to do that you know maybe every 30 minutes while you're cooking that's how often I did it so what I'm going to do is let this sit for about 10 minutes because you don't want to cut right into your chicken you want to give the juices inside enough time to settle and registry distribute themselves throughout the chicken and as you can see our vegetables at the bottom of pan of the pan are nice and fork tender and this chicken is nice and golden brown probably a little more Brown that I originally planned but I actually like my chicken to go for a while so that the skin is nice and brown and crispy so I'm going to let it sit for about ten minutes and then I will get it on our platter ready to serve all right guys here it is dinner is ready so we have our lemon herb roasted whole chicken as you can see it is nicely brown you can see all of those seasonings and spices all crusted on the chicken we have our vegetables that we cooked underneath the chicken goes in nice and tender and roast it and seasoned from the chicken and you compare this whatever you want to for dinner we are just having a side of rice as well as the remaining vegetables that were baked into chicken so yeah you guys I really hope that you enjoyed this video tonight and if you give it a try I would definitely love to know what you think about it don't forget to like this video and by giving it a thumbs up share it

rZFrz1NvPPc.json;today I'm going to show you guys how to make an easy beef stew in the crock pot now I have made um pot roast or beef stew where you brown the meat but a lot of you have commented a couple of you have sent me email messages where you want a beef stew recipe that's a bit easier that skips the step where you brown the meat first so this is the one this is kind of like a dumping a dump and go crock pot beef stew so here I'm working with about two and a half to three pounds of beef chuck roast that I've already cut into like large chunks so the first thing I'm going to do is add two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce so I'm going to use a clean hand and just work that in I'm going to coat the meat put a half teaspoon of salt remember the Worcestershire sauce I know I'm probably saying it wrong Worcestershire worst Worcestershire uh it's has you know it's salty so you don't want to go too much with the the salt here give that a mix cracked black pepper like a half teaspoon if you're using a fine ground pepper then a quarter teaspoon I'm also going to add like a half teaspoon of dried thyme you really can add dried herbs to your preference I'm just going to go with some dried thyme now I'm going to shake in five tablespoons of all-purpose flour five tablespoons of all-purpose flour and coat this meat this is going to help thicken whatever rendered juices end up in the crock pot okay nicely coated there we go I'm going to go over the other ingredients here I have a pound and a half to two pounds of gold potatoes that I just semi-peeled I rinsed and I cut them into chunks I have three medium to large carrots that I cut into chunks actually I think this was more like two or was it three yeah three medium carrots three cloves of garlic minced and two celery sticks that I chopped I rinsed clean chopped and I even chopped in the celery leaves I think that adds great flavor very aromatic and I'm also going to be adding the beefy onion soup mix that comes in a pack here I'm working with a six quart crock pot and I'm going to add my meat here we go I'm shaking whatever [Music] okay I'm gonna just make sure that's all mixed and evenly on the bottom there okay so there we go come on I'm gonna go in with my celery just put that on top here I have my garlic going in and my beefy onion soup dry mix I love using this because it makes life easy so this is why I didn't chop up any onions because you know I have this just sprinkle that on top now going in with my potatoes and carrots and that's that I'm going to cover I'm going to cover with a lid I'm also going to be adding one dried bay leaf before I forget this goes great with the other aromatics in this beef stew so going into the crock pot I'm going to quickly do this when you lift the lid too much on your crock pot it takes it longer so I nestled it right in here it takes it longer to come up to heat and to start cooking so sorry okay I'll be back Okay so it's three hours into the cook time and I want to give it a a mix here and combine everything it smells wonderful but I wanna you can see how much liquid has accumulated in the crock pot oh smells good with the thyme and the bay leaf and the celery and the garlic and the okay quickly cover with the lid and I'm just going to let this continue cooking on a high heat it's been about three hours so maybe another hour and a half I'll check it okay so I have peas here I would say this is like almost two cups of peas I'm going to rinse these okay so these are rinsed oh smells amazing and it's foggy sorry so I'm gonna add my peas this is already at four hours of cook time on high and the meat is getting there but I do want it to cook for another hour but again look at this it's already forming like that gravy and you know what I'm gonna take out the bay leaf I think it's done its job so mix in the peas okay one more hour foreign some bread in this cast iron skillet have a little bit of butter here well it's more like like a tablespoon [Music] and here I have some French bread and I'm just going to toast that make sure I get butter on both sides foreign there we go okay so it has been five hours and before I give it a stir you see how some of the fat has pulled at the top I'm just going to skim that off and this is done I'm really trying not to get any there we go okay so this is nice and toasty I'm gonna put one right there okay so now I'm going to look at this this is perfect everything is soft and tender the meat just falls apart when you push on it it's so good the potatoes are soft and creamy but they still hold a good texture so it doesn't disintegrate by the time the meat gets soft but this is so good this is going to be so good I have some chopped parsley I'm gonna do a little bit on top there we go now good Scoop of this [Music] right on top of the bread [Music] it's dinner I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching foreign [Music] [Music];['segundos']
S1B5nr5r3tk.json;"Hi everyone! Its Natasha of Natashaskitchen.com and today i'm sharing our family's classic beef stew. It is so hearty and. flavorful and the beef is so tender, it just melts in your mouth. In a large oven. safe pot, preferably a Dutch oven, we're gonna saute six ounces of chopped bacon.. Stir that over medium heat until it's golden brown and the fat is released,. then remove it to a separate dish. While the bacon is cooking, stir together two. pounds of chopped beef with half a tablespoon of salt, a teaspoon of black. pepper and a quarter cup of flour. Stir that together until the beef is evenly. coated. Transfer half of the beef into the hot bacon fat and cook over medium. high heat or until the beef is browned - about three minutes per side. Add a. little more olive oil if needed, then add the second half of the beef and cook. until browned. Transfer the browned beef to the bowl with the bacon, add 2 cups of. good red wine to the pot and bring it to a boil, scraping the bottom to deglaze. the pot. Add one pound of thickly sliced mushrooms and simmer over medium heat. for 10 minutes. Roughly chop up four carrots into half-inch thick pieces, also. dice 1 medium yellow onion and chopped 4 garlic cloves. Place a large nonstick. skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then add the. sliced carrots, diced onion and chopped garlic. Saute that for 4 minutes, stirring. frequently. Once the onions are soft, add a tablespoon of tomato paste and saute. another minute. Then transfer the veggies to the pot. Add four cups of beef broth and season. with two bay leaves, half a teaspoon of dried thyme, a teaspoon of salt and half. a teaspoon of black pepper. Add the beef and bacon back to the pot, then stir in 1. pound of small potatoes. You can cut these in halves or quarters, depending on. how large they are. You want bite-sized pieces. Stir to combine and make sure the. potatoes are submerged in liquid. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, then transfer. to a preheated oven and bake at 325˚F for an hour and 45. minutes. Oh yes! Just in time for dinner and I am ready because the smell in my. house is making me so hungry. Ok let's do this.. Are you ready? YUM! mmm... okay and then before I serve it, I like to skim off the. extra fat; makes it just a little bit healthier and you don't really need that. extra oil on top and it's super easy to do. Just tilt your pot and spoon it up. And very important, I always love to add. a little bit of garnish because it adds that fresh pop of color and flavor. And. so I've got a little bit of parsley here. You can use dill if you like dill.. There - isn't that pretty? Okay, here we go. Oh my goodness and this. is just loaded with all the good stuff! It is so hearty and it's really a meal in. itself. I'd like to serve it with a fresh crusty. French bread. [bread crunch sound ] That sound gets me every time. Okay, here we go. Oh my goodness and. that beef is just fall apart tender. My spoon goes right through it. Okay and. this is still really hot so. Oh my goodness this is gonna be a good. dinner, literally that beef just melts in your mouth and there's so much flavor.. Adding the wine to the broth just really elevates the flavors and pulls them all. together. So good! I cannot wait to eat this for dinner and my kids love it,. which is like major win for Mom and it's fancy enough for a nice dinner. party. This seriously has really really good flavor, such a cozy thing for winter. and if you're not a mushroom lover, you can still enjoy this because if you. thickly slice the mushrooms, they are easy to avoid and if you love the. mushrooms... oh, I love thick sliced mushrooms. All right, I am gonna go call. my kids for dinner because I'm hungry.

sPKQUWYENig.json;well hello there friends today we're going to do something a little technical but not that difficult i'm going to show you how to butcher correctly a beef tenderloin i decided to do a video on that because i seen too many bad ones out there okay i'm gonna show you how to do this this is really a simple thing to do friends and uh but i want everybody to understand how to use the whole thing you know i see people on the internet they go they take the center cut which is the chateaubriand and they go oh this is a beautiful filament put this over there and put this over there put it in stew or something we're going to use the whole thing i'm going to show you how to do it correctly okay when you buy tenderloin friends you have two choices you can buy clean with no fat on it oh most of the time you're gonna buy what's gonna have a chain on it it's gonna have a silver skin it's gonna have a lot of fan on it first thing you wanna do is look at the date look at the day that is packed this was packed yesterday usually between the pack date and the cell date is like a week to 10 days so look at the date make sure it's firm and this is going to be this is the head the head is much bigger piece and it's going to go down to the tail try to buy one where the tail is not so thin this is this kind of thin one but i'm going to show you what to do when that happens so we don't waste it okay i'll show you so make sure you do that firm look at the date buy prime if you can afford it otherwise buy a good choice this is the tenderloin you can buy at costco comes two-way clean or not clean i have it not so clean so i can show you how to do it okay very simple first thing we're gonna do is uh we're gonna cut the the cryback out that's a plastic thing and and i keep it like that and then we're going to take the piece of meat out very simple not nothing complicated so far i have a cutting board with a channel just in case we have some extra blood we're going to take it and put them right here and i'm going to use some paper towel first thing i want to do friends i want to fairly clean it up just a little bit yeah they say they see something but i've seen too many people massacre those so i want to really show you this is an expensive piece of meat i'm telling you you go you probably know you've bought it before and it's quite expensive and so we don't want to mess it up we want to get as much as we possibly can without wasting too much thing now this show this show this uh this segment today this uh video is just about cleaning the tenderloin we're gonna make more videos show you how to cook it but right now this is just to clean it because you got to get there right all right so now what do we do we got a lot of fat in here don't be afraid to use your hand a lot of people are afraid to use your hands we'll kind of remove the membrane a little bit and don't be afraid to remove to remove as much as you can with your hand first yeah there's not much to grab right here so now we're going to grab the knife now if you notice there's a head right there this is the header this is called the header tenderloin it's called the tell the tenderloin so in order for us to be removing the silver skin we're going to remove the membrane and we're going to use our hand and we're gonna get in and we're gonna open it up i'm gonna show you it's pretty simple okay it's not difficult at all the idea is to be able to see right now we can't see anything so we have to remove this membrane so we can see what we're doing all right so look remove the membrane you you just lift it up you see and try not to use the knife too much not yet not yet you're not ready for the knife yet you see look you just want to remove this membrane because if you try to use your knife now you're going to cut into this very expensive piece of meat and we don't want to do that so now look see what i'm doing i'm removed i remove the whole membrane and now i'm kind of using my finger and you see you can do a lot of cleaning first before you use your knife with your fingers you see so now you get to a point where i gotta cut this is what we call the chain okay and the chain you can waste a lot of time cleaning it but i promise you this is not very good the only thing you can do with this is grinded double grinder and triple grinder and maybe you can make um or you can use it for stock i use it for stock but you can grind it there's a lot a lot of sinew and nerves that are going all the way through so it's not easy to clean people say you could clean it up to make a shish bag with it it's full of nerves and and and seen you and all good so look now what i'm going to do is i'm going to remove this right now just to get it out of the way all right so now we're going to go in and we're going to clean up the head a little bit okay so look see what i turn it the other way and look see this is what we call the silver skin we got to remove all this and we got to remove this without removing any meat so what i do is i take my knife and i keep it against the silver skin you see see the way i'm doing it friends we we have a few cameras so i hope we can capture everything but it's not exactly see what i'm doing my knife is tilted against the silver skin so i can expose it in order to remove it i need to expose it if i don't expose it how am i going to be able to remove it and you see so i'm opening the whole thing up very simple i'm telling you it's not complicated and now we're going to remove this so let's clean this up a little bit the extra fat we're going to put here i'm going to show you how to remove that silver skin when you see it you're going to go well that's pretty simple to do so boning knife by the way very important you can't do that with the chef's knife friend if you don't have a boning knife i highly recommend you invest in one of them it saves you a lot of money to do it and it's so much easier to do bonnie knife is a must so look silver skin you grab it right here on the front you grab it right there on the front and then take your knife and slightly tilt it on that silver skin you see look slightly tilted and let me let me make sure i go a little further so you'll see it more you'll understand what it is that i'm doing you see how i'm scraping the silver skin if i go too hard i'll cut it so i don't want to cut it right i just want to slightly scrape it you see then we have no meat on the other side see look pretty simple right let's see you take it so but you keep it folded don't don't put it out there otherwise you'll dig into the meat so you keep it folded even as you remove it you can look at it if you want to make sure you're doing a good job but you see right there so now we removed all of that silver skin and that's good for nothing i use it for stock but that's all it's good for all right so the silver skin it's got if it's got a little flavor in it we're going to continue removing it you see so if you're doing a tenderloin at home you'll follow the video and you'll do it exactly as i do it and i promise you're going to get some beautiful results you see all right so so far we're doing so good okay so now let's continue removing that silver skin friends let's continue you see same same deal when i was a restaurant business i would do this three four hours a day cleaning the meat that was my first job actually when i was a kid at 12 years old he used to work in a butcher shop moshiari we used to make a sausage and all that i'll tell you i don't know if i'd ever told you the story but um the ladies of the fan the fancy ladies of a neighborhood would go machinery what's on a sausage today we're a bunch of kids working downstairs we're going what they should ask is what's not in a sausage today after everything will go in there anyway let me continue so now we gotta clean up the head a little bit so it's much much better we got a little fat in here now fat i'm not too worried about it we can remove a little bit of it just a little bit okay so now let's go back to the other side okay let's go back to the other side and as you can see right here we have a lot of fat we don't need all that fat right there we don't need all that fat right here in that head so we're going to clean it up okay i'll show you you watch come with me there you go here's your watch you watch you watch we're going to clean everything so we can use everything the idea is to try to have the least possible amount of waste because that stuff is expensive you see look removing it see all right there so now we have still a little bit of fat right there and then we're going to flip it on the other side and we're going to clean the other side and then i'm going to show you how to tie correctly how to prepare a beautiful roast okay now of course it's easier to remove it all i see that so many people doing and said oh cut all that stuff up i don't want to cut it up it's good stuff and it's good meat and it's it's too expensive to throw it all away all right so now we can leave this side like that i mean we can clean it up a little bit more if we want but we're good all right so remember clean up your cutting board every time that's why i got those balls right here what do we do with this right here very simple friends all we got to do at this point is take your knife keep it flat and you see and scrape the fat off keep it flat otherwise you're going to dig into the meat this is the part that's got a lot of fat in it but just don't worry about it you're going to show well i'll show you when i cook the roast of it you're going to be amazed how beautiful it looks and see all that fat right there is going to melt we're not throwing it away so when you see people telling you take the tail off which is what i'm cleaning right now and uh and uh throw it away or make hamburger meat with it or make stew with it this is not good stew meat friends this does not cook good at stew stew you're better off buying five dollars a pound or six dollar or eight dollar part number these days expensive uh chuck roast okay but you do not use filet mignon for uh for stews okay so you notice my knife is flat right because that fat right there is just on the outside so it's not difficult to clean you see keep the knife flat okay so here we go so far we're looking we're looking good see it's a shame of all that stuff but this would be this would be good in a hamburger yes the fat right there would be good for a hamburger all right so look we're going to do the same thing remember the silver skin right we grab it in the front we fold the knife see we fold the knife and we'll remove it a silver skin i don't care how good your teeth are that's never going to be tender all right so let's clean it up we're looking good okay up a little more at the end you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna do a uh after the video is finished today i can't do it now but i'm gonna weigh this right i'm gonna weigh this and uh and then i'm gonna calculate it so you'll have it i'll put that information in the end of the video you know show more when you read it it'll tell you uh because if you buy okay like this guy right there was uh 19 a pound cleaned it was 28 a pound an extra 9 a pound to clean them so we're gonna i'm gonna make the calculation for you so you'll know is it better to waste my time doing this because it took 10 minutes it probably took a little bit longer or do i uh do i buy it already clean and we'll do the calculation you'll be amazed you don't save that much money but sometimes you may not be able to buy it already clean so you have to buy it with a fat on all right so now what do we do friends okay well what most people do at this point friends they take this right there and they dispose of all this it's way too expensive so what i'm going to show you how to do is to make two beautiful beautiful perfect roasts okay first thing we're going to do is you see right here where the head stops we're going to take the heads and we're going to cut it right there right there it's going to give us a beautiful roast gorgeous okay you're gonna say how is that gonna cook beautiful so now you see a lot of people do what they do friends here they take it they go like this and they fold it like this right whenever you see somebody do that change channel not going to be good because oh this is going to be against the grain it's going to be dry it's going to be overcooked no good what we're going to do we're going to take this pay attention it's really cool okay now we could of course make this chateaubriand right here and make it a smaller roast in here you can do that as well and i'll show you we'll do it we'll do it real quick okay we make a chateaubriand right here chateaubriand that's uh for two for two people two one two there you go all right this is the chateaubriand beautiful shuttle you don't need to do anything to this now what do we do with this what here's what we're gonna do with it we're gonna make another beautiful roast so what we're gonna do we're gonna calculate it we're gonna fold we're gonna take i i'm trying to figure out how to explain it to you i want this side right now you see it's like this i want this side to be the same thickness as this side how do i get there i cut it right there and i take it and i do this and you're gonna say well how is that gonna cook you're never even gonna know those two pieces we're together the secret is to tie them correctly let's go to the next tape we don't need to tie this guy we're gonna need to tie this guy so i'm gonna show you all right what do we do next very simple friends butcher twine and make sure you don't do like a friend of mine he went to home depot to get a butcher twine it said it looked the same yeah it looked the same it was uh an island no good friends butchered wine you take it right there you take it the long piece i'm sorry you take the short piece right you take the short piece you put it in front of you it's very simple okay i see so many people they are wrapping around their hand their mom i mean they do so complicated it's very simple look look you take the piece of twine you leave about a foot in front of you and you go one two and you die now you notice it stays right because i did one two and then i tie and then you could do one more and you secure all right so now you take your other piece of twine now this guy right there all i need to do is tie this on top of it because if i don't tie it on top of it it's not gonna cook even evenly so look you go underneath you put it like this very simple look at what i do i'm going to do it again slowly so you can really really see it okay look you don't need to wrap it around your hand or do all that nonsense you take it put it right here on the cutting board remember what i do here right i go like this and i go underneath and then i grab it right there the secret my friends is this piece of twine right there has to be straight it cannot be here see this is not straight you can't grab it right there it has to be straight so you keep it straight and you go over and under see over and under a child could do these friends we're gonna do one more time okay i think i'm going to run out of twine look under keep it straight remember the secret friend is to keep it straight right go over and under over and under and now look now you go like this and you're going to tie it over there except mine is too short so what do you do i tell you what you do no problemo you take a piece of twine and you give it a bandage and it's gonna happen to you trust me if it happens to me after 50 years of doing this you know how many thousands and millions of those i did and it happened to me right so it's happened to you you put a piece of twine in there so you don't have to start all over again all right and then ah screwed it up a second i'm gonna do the other one again okay just in case so i'll do it nice all right all right now we're gonna tie it and my friends this filament right there is gonna cook absolutely perfect okay so i'll do another one better this time i take a bigger twine i can't believe i took a small piece of twine that's okay all right so look no silver skin okay maybe it's a little bit left right here look we might remove it just a little bit okay but it's not nitpick if i do not tie this correctly my friends this would be a perfect rose for for six to eight people easily this would be perfect for two this would be perfect for two three maybe uh or four if you give them if you want to style them but look let me tell you what's gonna happen here friends let's clean it up a little bit better if you don't tie this when you cook it it's going to be like this it's never going to cook evenly but i promise you we're going to do it we're going to do it i'm going to do it with you so you'll see it when you tie this correctly you'll never know what a cut is i'm going to show you we're going to do it we're going to do it i'm going to cook it i'm going to cook it next week or whenever it is that i'm cooking it uh you look and it's going to be called the perfect roast and uh and you'll see it all right first thing we want to do take enough wine take enough to wine i'll tell you every mistake you can make in the kitchen i made them you would think i make them only once one no no me i'll make them three or four times all right so i better have enough this time uh you know what i may not have enough i'm not taking a chance of doing it again i showed you enough how to put a bandage so i am not going to mess it up again i hope this is longer okay so look you're taking the piece twine a small one in the front like about a foot okay about a foot right remember what you do right it's a good thing i do it twice so look one two why do you do two because when you go like this it stays one two okay so far easy right none of that wrapping around your hand and moving the thing don't do nothing don't even touch the meat you don't even have to touch the meat okay now look guys very simple okay we're gonna whatever we do right we go underneath but we put we put our fingers in here so this is tight right there right we're tight and we go right underneath you'll have to pick it up right so now remember what i said right this piece right there has to be straight right so we go in and over and under over and under it's pretty easy right over and under and pull us very tight very tight friend it has to be remember it has to be very tight otherwise it's going to be an air pocket and it's not going to cook evenly you're going to be amazed when i cut it look like one piece of meat all right remember now right there pull it really really tight and go over and under over and under it's not difficult see over and over folks all right let's do it again pull it so make sure it's really really tight now over and under and one more time because if i do it one more time i'm not gonna have enough twine again yeah yeah yeah here we go perfect this is perfect over and under see over and under right there my friends right here right simple right now flip it over tuck the tail in just a little bit tuck it in right there and now look one two now at this point call your better half and tell him to put a finger on it or do this

sPzBPj5mOls.json;[Music] cooking fish at home can be really tricky the fish is fragile it can overcook not to mention the fact that it's really expensive so i know why people go out to seafood restaurants but it's actually a restaurant technique that we're going to use today that's going to make you look like a pro at home and it's super easy so let's talk about what i'm using here we've got two beautiful cod fillets they're about an inch thick and each of them weighs around six ounces now that's pretty important you want to stick to this size and thickness of fish but you can use halibut or snapper of the similar size now i'm going to set these aside for just a second because the method that we're using today is butter basting butter basting is going to help us cook the fish from the bottom up and the top down nice and gentle but we're going to get some beautiful color and great flavor so of course we're going to need butter and i want to prep everything ahead of time because the cooking method goes really fast so i need about three tablespoons of butter and i'm going to cut the butter into half inch pieces that's just so that when i add them to our skillet they're going to melt super fast you don't have to be too precise about this this really is just about breaking it down in size so now i want to work on a couple of other flavorings that i'm going to add to the butter it's going to make a sauce that tastes great so i've got two garlic cloves here and we're going to smash these cloves i'll smash them with the side of my knife just makes it easier to peel but you don't want to mince the cloves or even cut them into smaller pieces and that's because they'll burn during this method so keep them in pretty large pieces as whole as possible is great if they break apart that's fine too next up a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme fresh thyme is perfect it's got this woody stem it's going to add a really beautiful herbal note to our sauce now i've been making this recipe a lot and if you don't have thyme on hand other woody herbs will work great like marjoram or oregano so now i've got basically everything ready all i need to do is heat up my pan and i've got a 12 inch non-stick skillet here you don't have to use a non-stick skillet you can use a carbon steel skillet but you want to make sure that it's really well seasoned because it's super important that the fish does not stick to the pan i'm going to add a tablespoon of vegetable oil we're going to heat this over medium-high heat until the oil just starts to smoke so while this is heating i'm going to go ahead and bring my fish back up here just a couple more things to do i want to pat these fillets dry with paper towels just to ensure that we get some really beautiful color and crust on the exterior of our fish i'll do that to both sides here and then i'm going to hit them with salt and pepper but before i do i want to show you you see this coloring here this is where the skin was attached to the fish so i'm going to call this the skinned side we're going to use this side to create a beautiful crust on our fish this side is flatter it's a little bit heartier than this interior side so i'm just going to season the fish here i've already pre-mixed my salt and pepper i have a half a teaspoon of kosher salt mixed with an eighth of a teaspoon of ground black pepper it's a good idea to mix them ahead so that you don't have to fiddle around with a salt box or a pepper mill after you've been handling fish so i'll flip these over and all i have to do now is wait on that pan and the oil all right the oil is just starting to smoke i'm going to turn the heat down to medium let me give this a nice little swirl and now i'm going to put the fish into the pan skinned side down all right that is a good sizzle take a spatula and just press on the fish for about five seconds because i want it to be nice and flat underneath there where it touches the pan and that ensures that we get a really pretty crust all the way across all right so five seconds i'm going to start my timer because we're going to let this go over medium heat for between four and five minutes and during that time there's going to be some really lovely color on the underside there now i also turned the heat down to medium we wanted to give that initial blast of heat over high from a preheated pan in that preheated oil but then we're turning it down to medium just so that the fish doesn't cook too quickly [Music] all right let's check and see what's going on underneath the fish now i am using two spatulas here using a non-stick spatula to get under the fish you see that beautiful gold color there this metal spatula is not touching the skillet so i don't have to worry about using this metal one on non-stick so i'm going to let this cook for another minute on this second side just to let it firm up a little bit so it's been a minute now i'm going to add the butter just scatter it around the pan we're going to see that it's going to start to melt and all the solids and the butter the milk solids are going to start to brown and form a beautiful sauce so as soon as that butter is melted this is where butter basting comes into play i'm going to tilt the skillet down toward me let this butter pool and i'm going to take a spoon and just put it over the fish for about 15 seconds gorgeous so i'm going to put it flat on the surface now right back on the burner and cook it another 30 seconds so this is the method 15 seconds tilted 30 seconds on the fire and that's so that we're moderating the heat and allowing the fish to stay in the pan and get butter basted as long as possible all right i'm going to tilt again and take your time doing this now i'm not scratching the bottom of my skillet with my metal spoon i am using a spoon that has a nice deep bowl that's perfect all right another 30 seconds i've got a timer going that's counting up too so it makes it easy for me to know if it's been 15 seconds or 30 seconds so at this point i want to start taking the temp temp is always more important than the cooking time and i'm looking for a temperature at this point of 130 degrees in the thickest part right there so now i'm going to add the thyme sprigs and the garlic to the top of the pan it's going to splatter a little bit that's all right run some of that butter up there and now i'm going to continue to butter baste so now oh this aroma that's coming through here 15 seconds absolutely gorgeous and then as the butter races to the top of the pan it starts to pick up the flavors of the thyme and the garlic so 30 seconds on the burner 15 seconds of basting now the total cooking time is right around 8 to 10 minutes but again always more important to look at the internal temperature than the cooking time speaking of these are ready to take out of the pan here you want to get these out of the pan really quick so i'm going to use my two spatulas you can drizzle a little bit of that butter over the top if you like i think it's really pretty to put sprigs onto the plate just like that the fresh squeeze of lemon really is all that these need at the end i do cook this a lot so i know what i'm getting but i wish you were here because the flavors are amazing that fish is still so plump and juicy it's because it's not overcooked and this gorgeous color on the top not only from browning it in the skillet but from that browned butter it gives it a real nutty flavor too and i just pick up hints of the garlic and the thyme just enough it really is a game changer and it's a foolproof way to cook fish at home and it looks spectacular and i know that you're going to want to make it at home so just remember these keys start with a six ounce fillet that measures about an inch thick alternate between basting and cooking and then always pay more attention to the internal temperature than the cooking time so from america's test kitchen at home restaurant worthy and you can do it butter basted fish fillets with garlic and thyme thanks for watching america's test kitchen what do you think well leave a comment and let us know which recipes

SUSxWiB17oc.json;had chef down at the salt room in Brighton today when we cook in a wild sea bass with local scallops wild asparagus artichokes naki and a chicken veloute we're here at the salt room we're going to be prepping a amazing Latin quart sea bass now this fish has been scaled and trimmed up so I'm just going to show you how to break it down into finish first of all I'm just gonna quickly talk you through what to look for when buying a fish of this nature make sure you check the eyes you know they should be nice shiny not though or sunken good indication that the fish is fresh also is that the gills as you can see there they're nice and red and and you know it's smell is very important it really shouldn't smell of fish so first of all I want to run my knife down the back of the fish just to release the filling to make sure you've got a nice shot flexible knife for this and just follow the bones down to the ribcage we'll make a incision pound side of the head right the way through to the belly and just prise it open so let the knife do the way just follow it all the way around keeping as close to the barn as possible you don't want to lose any of that amazing flesh let's follow the ribcage around welcome across some pin bones but we'll take them out later there's one Phillip removed got pin buns running down here and some of the bones off the belly still but will requite take them out in a second then you just left with frame of the fish which will be used for stock or fish soup or something else they just using the whole animal right so we're left with to fill it to the sea bass we'll just check if there's any belly bones connected still we'll just run our knife down there trim them off discard that bit let next technique is called pin bonding so basically it's just a using a pair of fish tweezers to run your hands fingers down the middle of the sea bass you'll be able to feel the bones and they come out pretty easily yet to make there's always a couple at the front where the fill it connects to the head so make sure we remove all of them that's one of them done go for the next one and just repeat the process again just make sure you've got a little pot of water as well just to wash off the bones that you take them out one by one obviously it's very important to remove all of these before cooking done big customer chewing down on them against stuffing arthritis because warm left there we want you sure just run your finger down a couple of times just to double-check and then we're just going to pour up the Phillies now so it's going to take the belly off and just we get a nice neat portion so we move a little bit that's just writing it up then we want to be going for about 120 130 grand portion of bass in that's quite a nice portion size but I say the ingredients only cooking for you guys today and we've got sea bass obviously which we prepped earlier that paired up with some Brighton scallops from beachy head hand I've got some amazing and globe artichokes which have been cooked down in what we call in the industry and Allegretti which is basically a onions carrots celery coriander seeds some aromatics peppercorns bay leaves white wine vinegar olive oil originally but we're using rapeseed oil and white wine which is gently poach them isn't a sight bit of acidity with a vinegar and let's get poached off lovely we've got some English asparagus and we have got some wild asparagus as well which is you know one of my favorite ingredients when it's in season unfortunately they don't hang around too often and we got some potato gnocchi which we're just going to pan fry off and we're going to match out with a sweet corn puree sweet corn puree we basically bag the sweet corn kernels up with a butter into a backpack bag and we just cook them till they're really tender blitz them up no cream just a pure flavor the sweet corn and then we've also got a chicken veloute which is going to finish this with and that is a reduction of white wine shallots garlic and thyme then we deglaze that with the chicken stock reduce that by two-thirds add double cream bringing up to the boil strain it up and then we whisk in a little bit of soy lettuce in which creates hot and nice fire gives out a nice appearance on the plain and obviously the flame is amazing so this is double dark chicken stock and which pairs up really good and sweet corn the artichokes asparagus and obviously the sea bass as well it's quite a meaty fish type always stand these sort of flavors my first of all we're just going to season the sea bass little bit oil in a pan you want to get the skin nice and crispy on the bass that goes right hold it down for couple seconds just so you get a nice even coupon skin to live sweet home key right warming up Oh and another parents gonna go naki in there get a nice bit of color on there also cause if everything is same town so it's nice and quit the service once again a little bit salt then we're going to go in with scallops in a minute as well it's get a nice bit of color and the right choice cuts are down as you can see wanted as a sea bass coat seat cooking through the fish still on a service like a little bit under current lieutenant I will a rest in the pan you know I'm a firm believer and rest in the fishing of pan up and doing me where all the juices go back into the fish check both sides want to get a nice caramelization on the Rockies just for violet plus on the outside let's conceive got a lovely bit of brown coloring on the artichokes as well have a look at the fish getting there and the going going to scroll ups in a minute I don't take long to cook at all with our asparagus as well we've got a wild and English asparagus I believe are not peacekeeping somewhere warmth or the dishes ready to play now as you can see the fish is cooking pretty much halfway in and the song will turn it over see the skin beautiful and crispy and then once we know it I will throw in some butter will baste it up just to give some edges great ones of skin and give it that cameras Asian flavor set the scholars so you don't take like a minute each side to cook remove these keep the ward it's going to turn further scholars to can see bastard front of that chicken stock into the Paradis and finishing flutter yeah a little emulsion you're going there with

Swj6XWXjHmQ.json;[Music] this salmon fish curry is packed with delicious flavors it's easy to put together and it's a dish that you and your family can definitely enjoy any day of the week hey guys uh chef ryana here uh welcome back to my channel as always if you're not yet subscribed please remember to hit the subscribe button at the bottom and if it's your first time here today thanks for joining us welcome to my channel so salmon is a delicate fish so you want to be careful with the spices that you add into it so we are going to start by making a curry paste that is just some cumin some coriander some garlic everything goes into a small processor we process that and then we go into the pan and we go from there let's go ahead and start this [Music] so into a small blender bowl goes in one shallot two cloves garlic a small knob of ginger [Music] one green chili some green onions or scallions a teaspoon of cumin coriander [Music] a teaspoon of chili powder [Music] half a teaspoon turmeric [Music] one teaspoon garam masala half a teaspoon black pepper a teaspoon of salt some white of scallions goes in into our paste i'm also going to add some of the peeling here just take out the peel without the hawaii this adds very good flavor roughly chop this this goes into our small bowl here i'll cut this lemon add some of this juice [Music] i will add just a touch of rice wine vinegar here like a half a teaspoon half a teaspoon of sugar so this give it a bath to help this process i'm going to add just a touch of water here [Music] so there you have it so after a few buzzes here we have a nice paste here so this goes into our pan [Applause] so for our salmon i have a about pound of salmon here i'm going to cut this almond into some nice pieces here so i'll have that cut that in half [Music] and then cut this in half just a good amount for this aside we'll hand the stove and start cooking add a tablespoon of some vegetable oil onto our preheated pan and into the pan straighten we are going to add our paste i need only like two tablespoons of this the rest of the paste i'm going to freeze and i can use it later so the idea here is to cook this paste to start developing the flavors that we need for our curry this takes about three minutes on medium high heat you wanna keep stirring this so that it doesn't burn so once this comes together i'm going to add the rest of our spices so the same spices that we used to make the paste so that comes together i have some whites of scallions here or green onion i'm going to add them in these are two small tomatoes plum tomatoes nicely right add them [Music] and then cook them smells good here so we want to cook this until the tomatoes are cooked down this is to take about five minutes also the key in curry uh always is how you make the paste or the sauce once you make the sauce you can take it whichever direction that you wish we are using salmon today but you can certainly switch it to any fish that you have a cord tilapia any fish that you have and mostly white fish they work perfectly for this kind of recipe our tomatoes have nicely softened here i'm going to add one cup of tomato puree or tomato sauce and then give this a couple a couple minutes to another five minutes i cook it down bring it all together [Music] just added some stems of cilantro i always save them just to cook with them the leaves i use them for garnishing our sauce has nicely baked i'm going to heat it with just some water here about a half a cup put a lid on this and cook it for about 10 minutes on low heat after about 10 minutes you want to open the lid here give it a nice stir always be careful so that it doesn't scorch the reason i'm pre-cooking the sauce here or partially cooking the sauce here is because our fish doesn't take long to cook this looks nice and beautiful so i'll check for seasoning oh this is good i will bend it just a little bit more just slightly at this point i'm also going to heat it with just like a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce just a touch of salt and pepper remember how the sauce tastes here is poured at the whole dish will taste like so the fish here will only absorb the flavors that are already in here so you want to make sure that the flavors at this point they are right before you add the fish one more time seasoning oh perfect i will lower the heat so i will come in here and lay our salmon in here just carefully just late [Music] we are basically just going to poach the fish in this sauce this takes about five six ten minutes depending on the size of the fish it doesn't take long [Music] it's time to open the lid here and check where our curry is okay that looks beautiful we'll check our fish this is a shop right here so our fish seems to be ready here i'm going to heat this with some greens of scallions some parsley just remember when you're cooking always uh keep on checking for seasoning as you go oh that tastes perfect [Music] so there you have it my friends serve this delicious salmon curry over a bowl of rice [Music] i hope you have enjoyed the video just remember to like comment and subscribe to my channel and i will see you in the next one thank you so much for watching you;['segundos']

otherwise they get all rinse it never happened to you you got to knock your left in in the in the cupboard and and you smell it it doesn't smell fresh anymore keep them in the freezer anyway friends very simple we're going to take a little bit of parsley fresh parsley you know I like the curly parsley use the Italian pasta I mean I use that also sometimes I just think it smells so much better okay it's an I send a old-fashioned thing we love the kerdipar city a little bit of garlic when I want to be too garlicky just a little bit of garlic I'm gonna put a bit of fresh Rosemary I chopped that up it's easier a little Thyme and uh and and then we're gonna put a little bit of pine nuts and a little bit of almonds put whatever nuts you want you don't have any nuts don't worry about it not that big of a deal we're gonna process this and then I'm gonna put some beautiful garlic olive oil that's all you know like I tell everybody relax it's only cooking okay it's not the end of the world you don't have to follow exactly what I did they put salt and pepper here they probably didn't do it because I probably forgot again see put a little bit of salt in there friends a little bit of pepper it'll be a perfect way to season it you see right there and let's process this well you know what's happening right here it's stuck on the side of it so you need to um to stop it put a little more oil I want a little more liquid you see and what happened is my food processor is so big then uh I should have probably grabbed a smaller food processor you see and make a little quicker paste it's fine I want it to be a little more liquid that's all kind of like a flavored olive oil if you will you see all right friends I'm gonna fix this I'm gonna probably put it in a smaller food processor it'll be a little more liquid I don't want to be because what happens is if I leave that whole garlic like that I put on the outside it's gonna burn so I want to get a little more liquid okay so that's probably what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to a um a smaller food processor and make a little more liquid and then I'll come back and we'll we'll show you I'm going to show you how to tie the leg perfectly very simple all right I'll be back in a minute okay friends you see look look look look how much uh liquid how much more liquid it is you see I want it to be a liquid because if it's too chunky it's gonna burn on there okay you'll see it's going to be beautiful so now this is a typical leg of lamb folks then you get at the store um I got it already and it was already all tied up but because uh my butcher shop which actually is Whole Food in on Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale they do an amazing job and uh and they are all beautiful tied up and I took it all out because I wanted to show you how to do it okay it's really not complicated because you your butcher shop may not do it you would think they'd do it but Christians they don't do at least you know how to do it it's no big deal you see right there this is a typical this is a about a five pound one uh bone-in and it's nice because we can Slice It Off the Bone it's kind of dramatic to put on the plate it looks pretty good but you see right there there's flap right there we gotta tie it we got a tie right here that's why they tied so it's it all Cooks in one like this you see and um and so I'm gonna show you how to do it okay it's not complicated you need a butcher twine and usually what I like to do is measure about three times three times and then cut it normally Cuts right there but this this thing doesn't cut it's my new color but color is at the lunch they don't cut all right so all right so here we go friends well first thing we're going to do is we're going to tie a knot right here just a simple little knot right there oh oh another thing that they did which is really cool friends you see they clean the bone right there normally all the meat are there they cleaned it and you don't have to do it and which is very nice they already did it for me but if they didn't do it you want to do that you want to take the meat that is attached to the Bone and you want to take a little knife and scrape it up and then take a towel and clean it up nice all right so you want to keep this nice so you remove this and what you're going to do we're gonna go in the back of it first friends okay so we're starting with the back right there right and we're gonna take a twine which is three three times right we're gonna decorate it and we're gonna go on one side you see on one side a meaning like there's two side right there we're gonna go on one of the side right and then we're gonna go in and then we'll go back on the other side and we go back in you see and now we have the perfect amount of twine then we need it all right so then we tie this guy right there I don't want to be too make it too complicated but that's something like you guys can do it it's not complicated you can take it again tie it right there but you don't really need it it's just like this is solid the idea like I said is to be sure there you go nice and not and let's keep it clean you see right see so we see right there friends not complicated right so now at this point you can also tie uh uh this way um it's not really gonna go anywhere so if you are not comfortable doing this then don't waste that much time doing it I like to do it at least in the middle you see right there in the middle so we're going to go in one time two time oh what do you think of that I ate too much Wheaties today one time two times I've never cracked my butcher twine before it's never happened to me before friends and wow this is the first time in life on television then I crack it so now at this point you go in this way look it's very simple okay you go in this way you go underneath look so far right you're following me right underneath right and then you you keep this straight right there like this straight you see then you grab it look it's not complicated you go underneath and you pull it you see and now all you got to do is make a knot to secure it not to secure that's it and I'm not going to pull too hard because this thing is uh is weak there you go that's it all right so now look now we got ourselves exactly what whole food did except they did it for you but just in case you go to the store doesn't do it you want to be able to do it yourself okay you know what I forgot my garlic cloves over here the small garlic cloves I'm going to put some garlic cloves in here they cut magically they arrived we have some magic assistant here friends what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna rub a little bit because I want some of the flavor to go inside so what I do is I poke a hole with a knife and I bury it in there now it's slivers they're small friends because if they're small they're not going to cook you see see look look I think I took the garlic cloves and I just poke it I just cut it in very small slivers you see put as much or as little as you want here friends it's not going to hurt it now there's a little fat in there we're going to live a little bit of the fat now if you're gonna if people sometimes people don't like lamb is because they think it's gaming if there's one part of the Lamb it's gonna be gave me more than the rest of it is going to be the fat so the only fat really is on the other side it's not that much of a fat so we're not going to worry too much about it all right that's why I didn't clean it up too much they did a very good job this I tell you this butcher shop they do a great great job for whole food has uh has done a great great job at least in our town they do a beautiful job all right so friends right there we're ready to go now we're going to put our olive oil and uh and uh and Herb a little bit we're gonna put it on there you see and uh and this is it friends this this is it they were going to put this in the oven and then I'm going to put a thermometer now you know like for for beef same thing people have different uh temperature they like some like a rare some like a well done I don't really really like my lamb too rare medium medium rare maybe but not rare I don't eat lamb rare but that's a matter of opinion you either however you want yes and don't let somebody tell you it should be one way or should be any other you know what it should be should be your way they don't like it they can go eat somewhere else okay and what I remember when I was in a restaurant business people would say to me you're not gonna like me because someone might make well done I said I love you don't worry who am I the judge how are you like you meet you eat it however you want friends okay there's nobody that should tell you you should eat it one way or you should eat or the other you eat however it makes you happy all right so here we go friends we're gonna roast this guy so and then we're gonna go in the oven I got the oven at 375. so 75 is good we don't want to be too high so 375 is perfect for this and 375 works for so many recipes one day doing a recipe and and you don't know what temperature to put it in chicken Cooks perfect at 375. fish beautiful at 375 most fish 375 it's a great temperature it's not too hot it's hot and a half to cook and it does quite a quite a nice job what a mess I made that's okay you know I'm pretty impressed because I didn't make too much of a mess on my hands yet so here we go let's see I'm good on this side I'm good on the other side it smells amazing all right so now you know I like to put a thermometer on it so then I know what temperature it is on the inside I like to use this feature right here this thermometer yeah I do it for a primary but I do it for that you got this thing here this remote thing you put this on top of the oven right there which oven do I got I got the upper oven okay so we go we go right here or put it we can put it here right and then I'm gonna put this that what what I think is going to be the deepest part of the meat then it's going to be about right here we're gonna go in we don't want to touch a bone if you feel a bone then take it out of there right when I put it in here and we're going to take it out when it's about 125 130. um and that's going to be a right temperature probably 135 up to 135 so it depends how you like it you like it more cooked we're going to leave it in there longer we're going to put it in the oven now I'm gonna clean up all this and then uh I'll let you know the exact time how long it was the exact way I'll put all this on my uh on my recipe below below the the video there's a recipe when you click on show more it's very simple way to prepare it and uh it's going to be amazing so I'll come back when it's ready to go okay friends it took about an hour and a half so um but it's up to you how you want to cook okay some of you may like a more rare some of you may like a more well done so now this is the opposite side right there and all I gotta do is I gotta cut my twine I can't forget to cut the twine because it's not so good so we're gonna cut it right there release it to release it here release it here and now we have to do is release the two then we put in the middle because we just released the top right so now if we release this one we release this one we push it in we push it in we push this one in and we should have all of our twine in Two Shots well maybe three we're probably going to lose a little bit of the uh of the the paste but it's perfectly fine you can't just keep it on top of the twine underneath the twine so at this point friends we took it out of the oven um I took it out of the oven about 20 minutes ago take it out as early or as soon as you want but you got to let it rest a little bit friends just a little bit okay just let it rest this little bit now I don't know about you friends but I like my lamb very very very very very thin I don't like it to be a thick so I cut it very very very thin okay you see right there friends look at this look how beautiful that is hey you come back over here look how beautiful that is friends and it's like absolutely gorgeous look at this you see cut it thin now it's more delicate put it on a sandwich you put it on on a plate with roasted potato roasted vegetables look at this ones look how gorgeous that is it's gonna be so amazing so tender look at that it cuts like butter it cuts like butter to me this is cooked the Perfection here friends cook it however you want about I promise you this right there my friends it's perfect this is absolutely gorgeous dig a little bit in a pesto um it's beautiful absolutely gorgeous keep going until you got that down to the bone and friends this is not difficult to do I hope you make it remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to this Channel and ring that Bell thanks for watching we'll see you soon [Music];['segundos']
tGOF2CZr3iU.json;delicious well hello there welcome . once more to Kwankyewaa 's Kitchen   and if this is your first time stopping by . i'd like to say a very warm akwaaba to you.   fried fish lovers gather here this . recipe is just so perfect i know for sure   you're going to love it. The fish is fragrant, . it is soft on the inside a little bit crispy   on the outside and just absolutely delicious. . So i'm going to start off by cleaning my fish   they came individually wrapped so i'm going . to get them out of the plastic wrap first i'm going to start off by removing the fins from . my fish and i'm using my scissors to just trim   it which is easier and faster. Just like this. . So this particular fish comes partially cleaned   as you could see i had to still remove the fins. . The gills have been removed most of the skill has   also been removed but there's always a little . bit that is stuck on it that you don't want to   fry your fish with so i'm trying to remove those . skills especially from the back of the head   and then once that is thoroughly clean you can . go ahead and say that your fish is really clean   otherwise when you fry it all those skills was . just going to puff up and it's just going to   be sticking on your fish and that is not . presentable or desirable so definitely try   to make sure there's no skill on it even . if it says it's pre-cleaned before you go   ahead now that i've removed the scales i'm . going to remove the gill cover or the flap   if you really like you can also trim off the mouth . but i'm going to leave them off of my fish today   so i'm done cleaning both of them at this . point i'm going to just rinse it off thoroughly   and sometimes a little bit of the fish blood just . settles in the belly after the gas is removed so   that's what i'm just trying to use my scissors to . scrape off which came off easily and now i'm just   going to just set that aside it's rinsed and . then i'm going to clean this other one as well   i'm looking to come out with a very clean . smelling and tasting fish so i'm using a lemon   which i've cut up to just clean my fish . so i squeeze the juices of the lemon   onto my fish now i'm using the halves to just rub . around the fish to make sure that it is very clean   and this way your fish is going to come out not . smelling too fishy if i can say that especially   when you are going to be frying it indoors you . want to try to eliminate as much of the odors as   possible so i'm done doing this i'm going . to give my fish one final rinse and at this   point i can see that my fish has been very well . cleaned and ready to be cut up and fried they're   a little bit wet so i'm going to put them dry . just to make sure that it is perfect for frying   so just like this and now that they are thoroughly . dried i'm going to go ahead and cut it up   and of course you want to cut it up according . to the portions you want your fish to come in and once i'm done cutting them up i'm just . going to score it a little bit just like this   this allows it to just fry a little bit crispier   and of course the marinade or the seasoning is . going to seep into your fish a lot better this way   the middle part of course has two open ends . already so i just make one incision into it   so is the head since it has all those openings . and that is pretty much it i cut the other one up   as well scored them as well and now i'm . just going to transfer them into my bowl   to get them marinated right let's season our . fish to start i'm going to add some salt to this generous amount you want it to be very very . well seasoned i've added some onion powder   now i'm adding just a little bit of ginger . powder as well you want this to have a little   kick of spice some black pepper as well and . just a little bit of cayenne pepper well i   hope you are getting the drift at this point you . know this is red snapper rivery bougie fish okay   it has to live up to its name at the end of . the day when it's served it has to be tasty   look perfect just as you would expect red stamper . to be so i'm going to make sure that every part   of it is well seasoned and with that i'm going . to make sure i'm i'm rubbing some of my marinade   into all cavities as you can just see me do so the . head part and everything make sure that it is very   very well covered with your marinade this is just . perfection okay and at this point when i'm done   with it i'm just going to set it aside and then . start heating my oil this is fish it doesn't need   that much time to marinate but of course you . can let it sit a while in your fridge just to   let the flavors mingle and seep in a little . bit more but this is enough marinade on it   that i can just go ahead and fry this . and it's going to be perfect anyway   we are going to be deep frying the fish so i have . some oil here in my pan it is just about heating   up i'm adding in here some few sprigs of raspberry . this way it's going to infuse all the fragrance   into the oil before it even starts to heat up the . fresh is going to end up being tastier smell good   and of course the aroma in your house is going . to be a little bit less fishy i'm going to add   a little bit of flour to my fish just to give it . a little bit of coating this is what is going to   bring that crispiness to the outer part of your . face so very little dusting of flour is all i   added in here and because it has a little bit of . bit of moisture it's going to cling to it and that   is just going to be the perfect way you want it . to be so i'm adding just a little extra dusting of   flour and at this point i think it's perfect i'm . just going to make sure that it is well covered   onto my fish and just wait for my oil to be heated . up and then we can go ahead and fry it very simple   i've put some holes into these two fresno . chilies i'm going to add them in my oil they   infuse just beautiful fragrances into your fish . or your meat when you have them in the oil and   right after i did that i'm going to start frying . my fish so it's going to just heat up and infuse   as the fish fries of course you want the oil to . be very very hot sizzling hot before you start   introducing your fish into it because otherwise . the fish is going to soak up some of that oil and   you don't want that we want this fish to come . out perfect very very crispy on the outside a   little bit juicy or moist in the inside but you . don't want the juices to be the oil no you don't   want it to be filled with oil once your fish has . fried for about five to six minutes you want to   go ahead and start flipping them or turning . them so the other side gets to cook as well after frying the other side for about four minutes . i like to just go ahead and be turning my face   just to give every part of it a little bit of . crispness to it so you want to make sure that   the parts that we're not lean directly into the . oil get a chance to also fry up beautifully and   golden and that is pretty much it all it takes . is about 10 to 12 minutes your fish is perfectly   fried and now i'm just going to transfer them onto . a plate lined with paper towel and then i'll go   ahead and fry the other part that i didn't get to . fry but just look at how gorgeous this is as you   can see it looks very plump it is no way dry very . very crispy on the outside the aramis here this is   fried fish but my house is not smelling terrible . because the rosemary and of course the peppers is   taking care of some of that this is just perfect . you will love this i know for sure i'm going to   fry the head parts now i normally leave that . for the last because sometimes they just bring   out some juices that change the color of your fish . so if i've cut them into portions i always try to   fry the head part last and today they turned out . perfect but it's always good to air on the side   of caution so i'm going to bring them out of the . oil at this point it is perfectly fried also just   look at how beautiful this is very very quick very . simple but everybody is going to know that there   is a little bit of something different about this . fish okay and that is what we aim to achieve you   want people to wonder oh what did she put in there . what could it be and as you saw these are very   simple ingredients all natural very good for you . but look at the results and of course we are going   to have this with a little bit of kenkey because . kenkey and fried fish are a perfect combination.   Kindly hit that like button for me and i'll . be very honored if you will share this video   as well. And until i come your way next time with . something delicious, be loving, be kind, be happy;['segundos']
TMCNxwKeqIY.json;[Music] i made this fish carry not too long ago it turned out so great this feels like i went to the indian restaurant i hope you are able to try this recipe i know it is a real keeper and you will love it here are the ingredients i'm using and as always i'll list them for you in the description box so my fish of choice is going to be this white sea bass i have cut it up washed it pat it dry and to that i'm applying some paprika turmeric and some salt as my seasoning now you coat the fish with the spices turmeric powder can stain and it actually did stain my fingers it took me a few days to get rid of the stain so if possible wear a pair of gloves or use some tongs so you don't have to directly touch the fish with the turmeric on it make sure the fish is very well coated you want it to come out flavorful now i'll set this aside for 30 minutes to marinate [Music] so now let's get ready to make a sauce i'm going to put my garlic in my blender ginger already cut up i'm using two serrano chilies you can use one if you don't want this to be hot but i want it spicy and my tomatoes i'm gonna cut up so i'm just gonna quarter my tomatoes into the blender also going to cut up my onions so in my pan i'm going to add about three tablespoons of oil let's just say about four this is what we are going to fry the fish in so it's pretty much shallow frying and i'm using avocado oil the oil is hot so i'm going to start frying my fish [Music] [Music] we're definitely going to need to do two batches of the fish i'm going to chop my coriander while the fish fries [Music] [Music] the stock of the coriander has so much fragrance you really want to chop it up and add it to everything the fish has fried for about five minutes and it's time for me to turn them the white stuff you see on the surface is just the albumin of protein from the fish that just coagulated and shipped through the fish to come on the surface it is totally fine and you can leave this on or you can just try to get rid of it whatever really pleases you i'm going to remove the fish so i can fry the next patch [Music] now we're going to fry the rest okay we're gonna bring out the fish [Music] [Music] okay [Music] now we set the fish aside and make this sauce i'm going to put about three tablespoons of oil here to start making the sauce just about this much the oil is hot so i'm going to pour my blended ingredients here we're going to wait until this cooks all the way down i had to cover this to prevent it from splattering everywhere get in there i've allowed my sauce to keep cooking until now you can see some oil beginning to come to the surface it is almost all the way cooked and now i think i can add my spices to the sauce and then i'm using paprika so i've added that here and coriander i'm also going to add some salt definitely according to your taste now i'm going to mix it all up [Music] and let it cook so you want to cook your tomatoes and other ingredients all the way through dry out before you add your milk to it your coconut milk and so at this point it has dried out it's pretty much cooked i'm just going to add a little bit of water to help it cook through a little more before i add my coconut milk the recipe called for one cup of coconut milk what i have is more of cream so i'm going to start off by using half of what i have here and then we'll see how it goes i think i could pretty much use everything so i'm just going to put it on here stair yeah i think this looks perfect now i'm also going to thin this out with about a cup of water and i'm going to let it cook through about another eight minutes it is perfect time for me to add my garam masala which is like the icing on the cake as soon as this hits your sauce you just get that curry vibe it actually puts the curry in your carry it smells like you just entered into some good restaurant this is the real deal so i'm going to put the fish in now let it stay here for about 10 minutes to soak up the flavors so i'm just going to introduce all my flavorful oils back here and i think this looks a little bit thick i'm going to thin it out a little bit more i'm going to pour in here about half a cup of water so the fish cooks with some moisture and you know this is soft fish so it is not very hard fried so be careful when you stir so it doesn't it doesn't fall apart our curry is done at this point oils coming on the surface fish definitely must have soaked some of the flavors and i'm going to add in my coriander leaves just give it a notch to spread and mix up i'm gonna let this simmer for about another two to three minutes and my curry is ready our curry is done now and it's time to serve just look at how good it is looking delicious to let you know the verdict so let's do it this feels like i went to the indian restaurant the fragrance the flavor aroma you really need to try this now let's see the fish piece of that fish very soft and very tasty try this kindly give me a thumbs up and share and until i come your way next time with something delicious be loving be kind be happy delicious;['segundos']

your cover now you're gonna see right here i got two seasons in here look that's black pepper and this right here is paprika the difference is listen i hear people say that they can't really taste paprika you know what i mean because i really don't have no taste or whatever they use it for color look this is smoked paprika i'll put a link hey you got to get it we got to start cooking and broadening our horizon folks all right now this is dried parsley i suggest you guys go ahead and get yourself some fresh parsley but listen i'm too stubborn to put you know write everything down or for me put it into my phone didn't pick up no parsley so i'm gonna have to use dried then we got two eggs right here these are two large eggs right here we got a third cup of whole milk and i got them onions too and again listen i cut them down so they fine right so that these will cook and they'll soften up a little bit you know when they're inside the pan all right so you saw that there again this is everything for the meatloaf and then i'm gonna be using this meatloaf pan right here not gonna use that this is it this is a five by nine and you know what let me go ahead and go i don't have it out right now let me get it i got two pounds of uh two pounds of 85 15 ground beef and here it is right here you can see right there 85 15. this is it right here so let's go ahead hurry up and throw this together and get it in the oven okay get yourself a bowl and then you want to just go ahead only thing i tell you is i always start with my ground beef first after that in no particular order we're just going to throw everything in the bowl all right one of the things i like about you know about a meatloaf is it's almost like a crock-pot recipe you know what because what we're going to do is you guys might be familiar with this term called dump and go so we're going to put our onions in you guys getting the point right now huh dump and go bell peppers okay and then we're gonna come with our parsley and again listen if you guys can get fresh parsley that's the best way you know what i mean then you just come with the rest of your seasonings and then right here you can see i'm adding my minced garlic you know what get yourself a rubber spatula you'll be easy on your glass you know and everything will just last longer without your scratches and then after that we're going to come with the ketchup and then our two eggs you know if we making meatloaf we gonna have eggs hey so real simple put that in there and check this out because i didn't use separate bowls i was just cautious about how you know distributed the uh the creole the creole kick and the salt so i kind of like just spread that all the way you know throughout then i was thinking to myself you know just smelling the aroma i was saying to myself hey you know what why not put some w sauce in this also so after adding uh bread crumbs you know i'm thinking i got to put these hands on this meat so let's go ahead and get it in and we're just going to work it like it's dough now you know i just spoke up on it hey this is optional but i'm gonna use it just use yourself about a tablespoon full now listen we're just gonna put about a tablespoon on there it's really up to you you don't want to like overpower it with the w sauce you know what i mean so just a tablespoon and move on and then once we got that mixed up last but not least we just add the milk this right here is going to be moist you guys hey this is gonna make for a killer i mean when i say killer i mean a killer meatloaf you can see how that how it just absorbs up in here it loosens up some of that w sauce and the rest of the ingredients just to ensure that it gets you know completely you know mixed up and then throughout listen you want your flavor to be in every bite now for me i'm gonna go ahead and use some of this non-stick you know you guys can do non-stick you can take a butter and grease it however you want to do it you don't need a whole lot you just want to make sure you get it everywhere but you don't want to pull it all up now our objective is to get this inside this so we can form our mold and then what you want to do is you just want to get it once you get it in here you don't want to pack it i mean listen you want to pack it but you don't want to pack it like where it's super tight you know what we just want to go ahead i'll just do it like this so you guys can see you know i mean you want to make sure you don't have any uh no corners or whatever and then i'm gonna put it like a little design but not really a design but i'll show you just one second all right so what i do is once i got it like this and it's in all four corners you know good now i'll take it like this i take my fingers and i just i give it like a little indentation only on the edges just like this i don't know if you guys can see that [Music] you should have something like that now you want to put it in your preheated oven which should be at 375 degrees we're going to put that in for 45 minutes alexa set a meatloaf timer for 45 minutes meatloaf timer 45 minutes starting now all right got the meatloaf in the oven now i'm getting ready to go ahead and make my meatloaf sauce sauce you know what super simple look all you're gonna need yourself is a bowl i say get yourself a whisk whisk works the best i got this little uh this rubber you know brush this one i'm gonna use to brush the sauce on top of it you know and we got a few ingredients so now let me go ahead and get myself a spatula and then we'll move forward all right okay so first thing we're gonna do is when we start our sauces we're gonna start off with you know pouring our ketchup and that's three quarters cup of that hines you know we didn't already had that debate you guys know where i stand you know what it's hinds the only way to go we got one teaspoon and a half a white vinegar we got two tablespoons this is two tablespoons and a half of brown sugar now i like to take my brown sugar and do this because you know sometimes it comes it depends if it's been out it might have some lumps in it and now i got a trio seasoning for you right here listen we got one teaspoon of garlic powder a half a teaspoon of onion powder and then we got a quarter teaspoon of black pepper [Music] and then here i got my salt i'm just gonna go ahead and give it a little pinch that's about all we need right there now we take our whisk and you know whisk it up do our thing now when it comes out of the oven then we're going to coat it then we're going to go back into the oven for about another 15 to 20 minutes so we'll leave it like this and then we'll wait for the meatloaf to be done okay and then once you come out at an hour i mean excuse me once you come out at 45 minutes this is what you should you know have right here now you remember this this is our meat sauce this right here is what sends it over the top so just giving it another whirl okay what you see in here look i started out using that little rubber brush but that wasn't working so look let me just keep it real go ahead and get yourself a spoon and then put your ketchup you know your sauce on top of that and probably if i wasn't filming i just would have poured it on top now this is what it looks like you know once it's done then we're gonna put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes now here we go i checked it at 15 minutes and i decided to let it get another you know three minutes so a total of 18 minutes you know for me to get it to where you know where my uh my top looks just like this now we're going to let it rest for about 10 to 12 minutes and after that we're going to plate it and then we're gonna slice it okay got it brushed all over look i'm taking a bread knife i just like it for i like to use a knife when i do these you know something that's serrated you know so then i take it let's see i'm gonna go ahead and get myself a fork you know just so that it doesn't move and then we're gonna go ahead and cut ourselves one you know just take your time oh it's nice and moist oh yeah this right here will be that million dollar cut this is what you guys want to see right here this should make you guys run out there and go get it that right there look you can see it's still moist look that's it so i'm gonna cut one more slice now if you ask me how many people do i think this will uh serve i'm gonna say six just to be you know just to be safe oh yeah look at that you guys let's go ahead and just cut one more but it'll probably do eight you know i mean it depends on how big the appetites are at the uh table so here you go folks you know what i mean look staying together is nice and firm but i'm really not using no pressure at all look at this oh yeah and that right there is what i'm talking about so tell me what you guys think about this one here you know what just put my own little spin on an old tradition you know what i mean hey listen and the most important thing i got to say is listen if you never even gave this no thought this meal can be made well i'm not gonna say the whole meal but you can make a meatloaf between ten dollars and twelve dollars you can't beat that hey so i want you guys to let me know down in the comment section below hey what would you serve this with because i'm getting ready to put on some uh where's it at right now hey check it out i got myself a got myself a bag of potatoes i'm getting ready to make me some garlic herb mashed potatoes and i'm gonna make me some uh peas

U3DQRlF_qnM.json;i just took this thing out of the oven look at this meatloaf it's got beef it's got vegan it's got pork it's got uh uh ham it's got the salami it's got a oh this is amazing if you could smell it you got to stay do you got to make this you see you guys are going to love it it's amazing remember if you like the channel we love you to subscribe don't forget to give us a thumbs up and don't forget to ring the bell so you get the new video stay tuned i will show you how to make this amazing okay friends this is my favorite meatloaf and my famous meatloaf i should say when i was in a restaurant business in 1976 yeah that's a long time ago some of you were not even born i had a restaurant in fort lauderdale called the left bank and we were open for lunch and on thursday we had meatloaf i'll never forget we would open up a door at 11 30 11 15 they were outside waiting to get in because by 11 35 the restaurant was full everybody wanted meatloaf that's the meatloaf so i'm going to show you how to make it it's really really simple okay we got veal we got pork and i use a pork loin and i use a v loin and we have chuck roast and um and i grinded myself now you're gonna say ah can i buy buy whatever you want to buy but trust me you want to educate yourself go on the internet and watch how ground meat is produced in uh anywhere in the world it's pretty scary stuff so i'd rather do it myself at least i know what it is you can get a pork shoulder you can get a pork loin whatever it makes you happy my favorite part of the beef is um is chuck roast but get whatever you want and uh and you can control the fat a lot of people like a lot of fat you know i don't really care for a lot of fats matter of fact um if i'm gonna have fat i like that i like it i like it to be olive oil i like it to be a butter i love butter right and uh but but this uh this animal fat things i mean unless i'm buying a new york strip and i got beautiful prime meats you know a meat grinder like this folks it's a hundred bucks some of them are even cheaper than that you can buy a good manual one my grandmother had this beautiful manual one that was fabulous put on a counter it's not like he's gonna use it every day because you're 30 dollars all right so believe me if you have a kitchenaid attachment you can buy kitchenaid attachment for it this is beautiful you can make hamburger you can do so many things with ground beef so do whatever you want it's your stomach and at the end in order to clean up all this because you still got a lot of meat in there i like to put a piece of bread in there and since we're going to put bread in a meatloaf anyway some breading you put a piece of bread in there and watch what you watch which will happen it'll push it right out you see and when you see the bread coming out you just stop that's all i mean you don't put the bread in there not gonna hurt it but you see look look you see right there it's starting to turn white see the bread is coming out all right so now we're good that's it mostly bread right there you see all right so this is bread we're done with this machine you see let me tell you friends try one time to do your own your own ground meat you won't believe it you you won't be buying no ground anything at the store anymore so you can do my mom would do uh a two time beef one time pork one time veal you can do equal amounts you can do whatever you want really okay it's really up to you so i got the beef in there going right i got my veal and they are going and i got my pork in here all right so i got three meat right there okay so everything is ready to go i got some beautiful ham in there i use a black forest ham cut in little cubes i got some salami de genoa a little salami in there i got some carrots cut in nice little dice okay i got some fresh thyme chopped parsley see everything is ready by the way what is that called mison plus when everything is chopped and diced and ready to go okay so we got this we got this we're gonna put some eggs in there i got about three four eggs i mixed them it's easier then we got a little bit of garlic we're gonna put some garlic in there i have my chopped garlic i made a video on how to do this it's just olive oil and garlic puree okay and garlic we're going to put a little bit of uh uh a breadcrumb this is fresh breadcrumb again we have a video for that i'll put a link in there so you see it a little bit of worcestershire sauce worcestershire sauce this is going to give us quite a bit of salt right the worcestershire sauce so before i forget let me put some salt and pepper in there and you notice everything is carefully measured folks as i said all the time it's not rocket science it's cooking okay um you could use some people use milk some people use yogurt i use buttermilk buttermilk gives you a really really really really nice flavor and then i got some onion then i just sauteed okay so sauteed onion you gotta slot it okay you can't just put raw onion in in in in a in the meatloaf okay because raw onion is never gonna cook now it's never gonna be calm if you could be here right now and smell those onions right there they're amazing they smell already fabulous a little bit of hot sauce certainly don't need to do that if you don't want to but i do so a little bit of hot sauce did i put a breadcrumb in there yet i put it over there you go now i hate when my doctor does that but we're gonna we're gonna massage this thing and then we're gonna put it in a beautiful mold wrapped with bacon let me tell you this is delicious and how bad could it be think about this right i got only good stuff in there right i mean i got good meats i got good good everything everything i have in here is is high quality so of course it's going to be good you know the problem is with a lot of meatloaf out there people don't meet love with crap with like crappy food it's just a meatloaf let me tell you something i love a good meal with the mashed potatoes the beautiful mushroom sauce you invite me in any time right as long as you use a good ingredient i don't care what you call it this is this is beautiful you can do so many cool things with this i'll tell you i like it i like it um hot of course but i also don't mind it cold mix it up really good all right you hear those people say don't mix it up you'll make it tough where did they get that information from you know i see so many information on youtube where do they get that information from some of the stuff they talk about i don't know where they get it from i'm telling you some of those ridiculous comments i hear on the internet and you know i've been a chef for 54 years i love it when somebody says to me oh that's not the right way to do it and guess what you do it the way you want to do it i'll do it the way i want to do after 54 years i know my way around the kitchen i love it when somebody says to me that's not the right way to do this yeah okay well you do it do you do it the way you like it here you go so now i think i'm done mixing i'm gonna go for a break no we're gonna do them all now let me put this aside now we're going to prepare the mold friends and this i do you i don't know if you've seen my chicken rotholo recipe but i have a a chicken rothory recipe where i do the same deal okay where i wrap it except it's made with chicken instead of being made with meat like that i make it's made with chicken all right so what we do is we line this whole thing right there friends it's the same deal i don't do it a different way there's no other ways to do it i mean yeah yes plenty of other ways to do it but this is the way i've been doing in my whole career okay i love this i learned to do this from a um shakati in france hey um that's one of the first job i had when i was probably like 12 years old you know in france they make you work a young boy let me tell you something you can play outside instead of that go work go make some money for the family we need the money so i was working at this uh it was a um so he did a lot of charcuterie and he did a lot of stuff himself a lot of prepared dishes and things and i always tell the story because it's always so funny to me but uh we were we were like five or six apprentices walking downstairs and the ladies of the neighborhood would say mushy are we what's in the sausage i knew we knew where was in the sausage it was anything that was left over at the end of the day that's put in a sausage mix that's why i don't eat sausage unless i make it myself so we should we would always say you should ask what's not in the sausage monsieur aren't we not what's in the sausage because everything in the sausage was crap god thank goodness i was only 12. so here we go friends look i think uh yeah i think i got to put another one right here all right so that's why you got to be careful where you buy your sausage okay so look now what we're going to do friends we're going to cover the ends right here you see on this one side okay you'll see it you see it when you see it you're going to love it this is really really really nice friends you watch let me make sure i got everything i need here got to push it aside right now on the other side i got to put something so i got this bacon right there then it's very a little thinner it's much much thinner so but i'm going to put some on the other side because i still got to do it so you see you buy the same ham and one package is beautiful and the other one is very very thin which really doesn't matter that much but what we're doing right here friends you see look you're going to love this recipe because you know i always say at the end of the day friends is you're only as good as the ingredient you put in the food you put good ingredient in good food is going to come out you put crop in right let me get a spoon that's really what it is i mean you put it good ingredient is gonna make good food crappy ingredient is gonna make crappy food that's all there is to it there's no magic we're not magician did i put salt and pepper in there yet yes i did just checking it wouldn't be the first time i forget it wouldn't be the first time i forget you know look at this let me tell you you could make a anything with this this is going to be fabulous and if you have extra meat which it looks like i'm gonna have that's for sure right if you have extra meat you can freeze it and next time you make a meatloaf you got it already or make one for your neighbor one for the neighbors friends look at this you know it's gonna be good and then it's gonna look really pretty you know it's gonna look really pretty the the ham and the the salami is gonna make it look really nice they're gonna stay in ice cube and the carrots it's gonna give it a beautiful color you'll see and and pack it in friends really really pack it in okay this is going to be delicious i am so hungry right now i could eat a cow well i'm about to eat one so look don't be afraid to pack it in friend don't be afraid to pack it in oh yeah all right so i think we're good what do you think i think we're good all right so now we're going to close it okay all right all right now we're going to close it okay friends so how do we close it we go we can close this guy first it doesn't really mean i don't like to cause this one first i like to close this one first so i'm going to go here here here just follow how it falls you know so it comes out easy and don't worry if it's small on that side it really doesn't matter you'll see you'll see and i said well that's not going to cover you're right it's not going to cover but i got it covered i got it covered all right so look now check that out you know what sometimes i wonder about me i should have become a plumber maybe i would have been better at that what do you think friends look at this now we're talking ah you see you see what i'm talking about you see what i'm talking about no you haven't seen nothing yet unless you see my chicken rotoro then then you're seeing it make it wish chicken rotolo is fabulous same deal same deal same day acceptance chicken pack it in pack it in i love that stuff okay all right so now now i'm gonna flip it i'm gonna put it on a cookie sheet and we're gonna put it in the oven but first we're gonna make a glaze so let me go get a cookie sheet i gotta do that i know i got one right here i got one right here here you go right there all right so now now friends we're gonna flip it on the cookie sheets you ready all right you take it and boom don't miss like i just did okay try to put it straight if you can help it all right otherwise you're gonna mess it all up all right you ready slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly take it out totally slowly slowly here you go check it out oh yeah baby oh yeah baby check it out howdy i like those turkeys no turkey enough how do you like this huh is that a meatloaf or is that a meatloaf friends i love it so now we're going to put a glaze on it so i tell you what i'll do because i got a mess in here let me clean up and get a little bit uh cleaned up in here and i'm gonna get a little pot because i don't know where my pot is and i'm gonna put it i'm gonna make a nice glaze so let me clean up i'll be right back okay friends we're going to put a glaze now i'm going to put um clean up the whole plate it was a mess a little bit of brown sugar uh that's going to give us a nice little sweetness on the outside i got ketchup in there put a little bit of worcestershire sauce i'm going to use a um a balsamic vinegar i have this apricot balsamic vinegar that is amazing it's a white balsamic vinegar apricot is really really special and a touch of hot sauce so we're going to give a little bit of heat to this glaze then we're going to put on the outside but very very little right then we're going to take a brush and we're going to brush this on the uh on the on the uh the meatloaf we're gonna brush it on you can skip it you know you can just put it in the oven like that it'll be delicious okay with or without the glaze the glaze gives it a well you know you know your glaze gives it a really really special um crust on the outside that it's kind of sweet so what i do is i just brush it on and and you want to be like generous okay when you do this you want to be generous and you may even put some of it toward the end when it comes out of the oven you can do that it's not like you need to cook it you know what i mean i mean i'm cooking it because i really wanted to uh to caramelize you know and we're going to put it on there you just brush it on like you would just brush things like you would just brush things like you're brushing things and say what is he talking about like your brush you know like you do some painting hey by the way the brush i'm using friends is a silicone washer i don't use the brush to get a home depot those are for painting they're not for glazing a meatloaf all right friends see look look don't be afraid to be generous with this okay be generous with this see i like when it goes in the groove you see look at this friends look at this yes i love it when it goes in put a little bit more don't be shy and you put it everywhere it smells delicious it's you know i don't use ketchup often but to make a glaze or to make a cocktail sauce there's certain product you gotta use ketchup it's just not the same without it it just has a little magic to it and uh i really think it's uh it makes this crust on the outside like you really want to eat it you know you really want to eat it make sure it's pretty you know there's no reason to splatter down not carefully you want it to be as pretty as you can i like to be nice and even you see well that reminds me of my restaurant it's like a couple of years ago it was in 1976. imagine that imagine that i had bought a restaurant and it was a fondue restaurant it was called zeni's anybody lived in fort lauderdale that long uh you know your family remember it and then i turned it to open up the left bank restaurant in 1976 wow that's a long time ago all right here you go friends look at this what do you think wow i hope you like it just as much as i do we're going to put it in the oven i'm going to put some cracked black pepper on top of this okay really really really really dark i got some cracked black pepper than a really coarse very very dark he's very black very very black very coarse you see put it on top don't be afraid you see and this is going to be kind of cool when you get a one of those uh peppercorn you can put some fresh thyme in there i do that with a chicken rotolo i put some fresh thyme on it that's it friends we're just going to take this maybe i'll put a black pepper on the side of it what do you think yeah yeah put a little bit on the side right there you see and then we're just going to bake it okay let me tell you this is the meatloaf you want to try to do we're going to pop it in the oven at about four and a quarter and we're gonna cook it until we have an internal temperature about 145. it's a little more cooked but we got pork in there we got it so we got to reach 145 150. 145. i like it to be pink i don't like it to be all well done you know pink and that's what the ham and the salami is going to give us those nice little chunk that i'm going to be nice and pink all right so we'll come back when it's out of the oven and we look at it okay it smells amazing in here folks it's been about an hour and a half i would say uh now 45 minutes and look at this look at this look at this oh baby that's what i'm talking about right there friends check this out oh yeah oh

UGZi6JAlUIw.json;hi this is Jeff with armadillo pepper the hot sauce barbecue sauce jerky and fiery snack store it's the fourth of July week and this evening we're going to show you how to grill grouper now a lot of folks are a little bit shy when it comes to grilling fish because the fish sticks to the grill and it just ends up being a mess we'll show you two or three little tricks here that will make that a lot easier for you grilled grouper is a awesome fish whether you're grilling it or begging whatever is such a great fish to have we're going to season this grouper lightly what I like to use is its Everglades fish and chicken seasoning it's not overpowering it's got a nice flavor to it grouper itself is a great tasting fish so at least here we don't like to add a lot of really strong seasoning to overpower the fish but this Everglades fish and chicken it's a real nice complement to it now you know you can do your own online search if you want to put with your own recipe that's great too everything we show you here will still apply you know whatever recipe to whatever recipe you're using now the first thing you want to do is heat your girl free to give up grill and make it very hot you don't want to put the fish on a medium or medium low grill you want to cook it quickly roughly five six minutes each side you'll see I've got some real nice grouper place here we went to the fish market today so you want to have a high heat what you also want to do is pre grease or pre-oiled the grill and I will show you how to do that then we'll place the grouper on the grill we'll let it cook five or six minutes on one side flip it over five or six minutes and remove it you don't want to grill fish like you might steak or a chop or you turning multiple times trying to get that nice crisscross here on the state you don't want to do that with fish the more you touch it the more you run into the problems of the fish falling apart on the grill so the first thing I'm going to do here is drizzle the grouper with some olive oil just drizzle this up a little bit I've got this nice little brush so that we can make it nice and even then we're just going to season this as I mentioned with the Everglades fish and chicken now the olive oil will help this seasoning stick as well as it will help to prevent the grouper from sticking on the grill I'm just going to turn these fillets over same thing little olive oil it's more seasoning as soon as we get this grouper seasoned up which we're almost done I'll show you how to prepare the grill all right what I've gone here is just some regular oil you don't need to use the expensive olive oil to cook this the grates on this grill to keep the fish from sticking so I think this might have been canola oil whatever I had in the pantry now the grill I've got set on medium-high I don't know you know how accurate the gauges says it's 700 degrees but I can't tell you it's pretty hot and then what I'm going to do is just take a pair of tongs and I've got a clean rag here we're going to soak up the oil and then just rub it on the grill grates now you know you do need to use caution here and be careful you can certainly start a fire or burn yourself if you're not paying attention while you're doing I've got just a little bit more here yeah you can do this with paper towels I've got plenty of these old rags so I don't mind using them and the next thing we're going to do is put the roofer on this grill and we'll let these gripper fillets cook like as I mentioned earlier about five or six minutes each side you do want to keep an eye on them just in case you get some flare-up from the oil that you put on the grill race it's been right around six minutes you can see the grouper they're the tips of it are starting to curl up and there's some juice laying here in the grouper so it's time to turn this now I like to use two different spatulas because these are pretty long plays don't worry you're going no matter what you do you will get a little stick yeah if you want to be a little bit more gentle and it wasn't that first piece then what I'm going to do here is just sprinkle a little lime fresh lime juice and I can't help myself oh my gosh we're going to close this up and let it cook about four or five minutes on this side we've been about five minutes on the other side our grouper is nice and ready we just remove our grouper fillets from the grill just going to put a little bit more fresh line here lime juice I should say look at those absolutely beautiful so there you have real grouper fillets you can see how easy it is to make these you don't have to be intimidated by fish on the grill again my name is Jeff with armadillo pepper you can check us out at armadillo pepper comm or see what we're up to over on Facebook;['segundos']
uNT_AxXrUGs.json;my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the philip does the least amount of work than all the other muscles is tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you find a phillips it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the rib eye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rump look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut and flash fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hangar steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly [Music] with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cook in it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really special for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a ribeye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying me knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meet you're buying find out the breed how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going gonna cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onion chilies generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in cut that and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that reddish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face you;['segundos']
VcKMgPYFyGk.json;a bone-in pork roast is a super delicious way to have a special holiday main dish this is not a boring pork roast instead it has tons of flavor I show you the simple ways to make it low and slow so it locks in all of the moisture all of the flavor and then roast at the end for that beautiful crackly skin you're going to enjoy it and be surprised how easy this is holidays we think of special occasion meals special occasion meat sometimes and so this is a pork roast but it is a bone-in pork roast also called a rib roast sometimes and traditionally a lot of people do a beef rib roast sometimes a standing rib roast um they can be pretty pricey they're delicious but a pork roast is a great way to have the same type of presentation something a little bit elevated super easy super stress free but looks like it took a little bit extra time so this is a rib roast and what I'm doing is fringing the bones now you can go and get your roast and say you want to bone in some people do this to make a crown roast pork really the only reason to do that is just for the look I don't really think they're worth it I actually just like to do a standing rib roast like this with pork and I am fritching the bones because I forgot to have the butcher do it this is something a lot of times you can just ask your butcher do can you Fringe the bones what does that mean it means cleaning the bones so you expose the bone it's just a traditional thing now let me tell you something it does nothing to affect the flavor it does nothing to really affect it other than it makes it a little bit cleaner because you don't have all the fat and all the extra meat around the bone so when you're roasting it's easier it's also easier to eat because you don't have all that to cut around at the table all that's left is just this little bone here at the top with the whole meat loin underneath so when you look at this you have the pork loin right here is the tender sirloin pretty much then this has all the bone and the rib on it so that's what we're doing now again you don't even have to clean these off if you want this is just for a more elegant presentation to make it a little bit more of a Christmas tradition something to do so to do that I'm taking a boning knife and I'm cutting down right next to the next rib I have and I'm just going to cut off the in between now obviously this is what you save this is rib meat so when you make ribs this is what you're eating so save that eat it roast it whatever you want and then you cut back behind it and you just start see how it's just kind of cutting against it and you're going to say well the bone doesn't look very clean but that is then where it comes in and you can start cleaning it now again don't feel bad asking your butcher to do this but it's also not that hard to do at home if you forget like I did you just take the heel then of your knife use a boning knife and you just scrape against them until they're clean so I'm going to finish up with this one then we'll go on to the flavoring so I got this done wash my hands what you can see though here is really cleaned bones again it's for presentation that's the thing at Christmas I think we have to remember it's a time to kind of do the extra use the Good China do the fun things and the thing is with meat I don't have meat all the time but when I do I make sure to get good quality meat that was treated right weight raised well and then I treat it right too I think that's the important part here so what I have over here is what we're going to put on it which is kind of like a quick little spice rub nothing too intense so I have some Rosemary that I chopped up now Rosemary when it comes to Winter it has a little bit of a heavier Aroma to it so we use it a lot in the winter and I love that I think that's really important have some garlic that is fresh that I have put together and you can see I just minced it and I'm gonna put that right in just a little dish with the pepper just you know ground black pepper because these are the things when you're having Rosemary when you're having garlic you don't want to fight with too many other things they're both nice and strong they have a lot of flavor to them so we're going to kind of leave them as is as the stars of the show now since I'm doing a rub on this I want to do just a very small amount very small amount of brown sugar that little bit of sweetness what it does is this has been sitting out so it dried out a little bit but since we're not wanting sweetness here but what we are wanting is it to caramelize almost on the meat offer a little bit more of this moisture play which sounds weird but what it does is it mixes the salt and really intensifies that retention in there which is wonderful we're going to add some salt kosher salt super important so just like I always say whether it's the turkey whatever it is Saltine the meat is super important so I'm going to mix all this together and you can see it becomes Sandy it just kind of starts to soak in some of the moistures that we're creating from the garlic even the Rosemary has some of that essential oil and it starts coming out so now what I want to do is come over to the prepared it's a beautiful center cut piece here so we use a center cut because then it has somewhat even thickness throughout if you get it to an end it starts getting narrow so make sure to always get that center cut I'm taking my knife and I'm going straight down into the fat cap side and I'm making some just small little slivers right inside of it but this can be a place for me to do is a place for me to see how I can get my finger in there just put some of that salt mixture and that flavoring right in it's really hard to get flavors like Rosemary into meat salt goes into meat sugar goes into meat flavorings like Rosemary don't always so we do things like this with a garlic and the Rosemary can actually get in and get some of that flavor where we want it so now what I'm going to do is take this mixture and just start rubbing it on and when I'm doing it you're going to see I'm going to make sure to get it in those little divots I created and this is just getting it in where we want it getting it right to the meat so that flavor gets dispersed all the way throughout and rub it all over so I flipped it over and I made sure to rub it on this side too I didn't put the divots on this side because the others went in kind of deep and I don't want to kind of counteract all those so I'm getting that salt that mixture all the way around now the only thing I want to do is put some string around it so this is just butchers twine butcher's rope if you will and what this does is it's going to just make sure it's somewhat evenly Rose because the thing is if you notice see how when I lay it down see how it flattens it out and if I stand it up it's more upright and it spreads it out so if you put these strings kind of in between what I'm going to do is lay them out put them in between each rib what that will do is ensure that as it is roasting you'll just have an even roast you can see as I cinch it together it right away just pulls it into that nice round and that's what you want you want that nice round so when you're putting these on it's always best to Loop it through once like you always would but then Loop it through a second time and pull what that does it holds and allows you the chance to then just tie it into a knot and that makes so like a butcher doesn't have to have a second person putting a finger down you know like when we're making gifts and we're wrapping gifts at Christmas and you're like can you complete your finger here so I can make that bow you don't have to do that if you do this double it's one of those little things that makes a big difference so I'm gonna finish this up then I'm going to set this in the fridge for about two hours one to two hours just like I do with any meat I want that salt that sugar to really work into the meat it's going to season it better flavor it better super important so this has been sitting in the fridge it was marinating dry rub sitting that's really what you want and now you can see it looks pretty much the same but what we're going to do is we're going to roast it now we're going to roast it of course on a rack the reason we do this so it just doesn't sit in its own juice and notice I have the fat cap just that little bit of fat sitting up why it kind of self base as that melts in the fruit in the oven it just kind of runs over the meat and that's what you want so air movement all the way around it will help it actually so it roasts evenly now what I'm going to do on this is a reverse roast method or reverse sear almost method meaning sometimes like we do mistakes I'm going to start it lower we're going to do a little bit lower and slower and then at the end we're going to crank the heat up to really get that crackly crispy exterior that you want so it's going to cook very evenly and low because pork has a tendency to what overcook gets to dry gets boring tasteless that's not what this is about this is about goodness so this roasted low and slow for quite a while and it doesn't look that gray right now it looks kind of like blah that's good that means we did not overcook it we cooked it just to 140 degrees then I brought it out of the oven so I could crank the oven up and while it was sitting that residual heat brought it up to 150 now I have the oven set High 500 Degrees and what I want to do is now just sear that fat and all the outside to give it some color it doesn't take much time at all and during that time we're going to make the sauce off camera I just said the sauce was a dump and go do you know what that means it's really no work we dump everything together and it's good to go it just has to cook a little bit so we're going to start with orange marmalade whatever brand or store-bought you can use home whatever you like we're gonna put that right in there we're gonna add some cranberries so cranberries have a tartness they have a sweetness and guess what they have pectin to them too and that's a beautiful thing because it thickens up with the marmalade a little bit don't knock it Dijon mustard I find Dijon mustard I could find a way to work it into almost anything I'm making in the kitchen and it's worth it it has a funkiness but it has this underlying flavor it really adds another spice we're going to add it's a weird one a little bit of clove now clove works really well with the flavors going on here with the marmalade with that mustard and it really does do something special we're going to add a little bit of orange zest so what the orange zest will do is one I think we all know by now oranges cranberries they're a friend and we're adding orange marmalade so already there's a good orange punch this is going to add a little bit more of that freshness right away so I do it upside down on my grater it traps it all and then I can just like that and put it right in I love that then I'm going to cut my orange in half just so I can add oh it's a beautiful one a little bit of that juice right in there and that's just gonna again add a little bit of that flavor right there I'm gonna throw one bigger Rosemary in we can just stir this together here not that you you can do it here you can do it on the stove we're going to bring it up to a simmer just let it simmer for a little bit until all those cranberries burst the meat will be done everything will be ready we'll be good to go so this literally cooked for just a few minutes just until those cranberries were beginning to burst so you can see I like some just to stay a butthole a lot of them are just bursting and see how soft they are so releasing their pectin and they're kind of sweet tartness which is what I want it's a beautiful sauce to have with it and then the meat came out of the oven now the meat had already rested outside the oven while it was preheating to the higher temperature which meat needs to rest before you slice it and everything you can just slice it because it redistributes the juices it helps so they don't dry out more yeah it's a big and it really makes a difference so I'm pulling off just all those strings see how evenly and beautiful it roasted and so now you know the traditional presentation is right here in front of you you can do it like that I like to maybe show it or just have a few you know you can make as big of one or small one as you want I like to have maybe a few of them then cut so you have kind of the presentation of the whole roast but then going through when you look uh look at that beautifulness now pork always has a slight pink to it that's very normal pork should you don't want to over roast your pork it will get dry use the temperature gauge you'll be happy and you'll have such a much better pork because of it so if you slice just a couple you're going to see how they're just beautiful I really I I think this is beautiful so you can even if you don't need if you have a bigger one you know you could have part of it on there have the other two kind of lane open beside it it's a it's a beautiful presentation it's a special presentation that's the point so I will of course try one as one must I do what I have to do now if you're not into bones you're gonna think well this is weird you know it's just that traditional look it's that beautiful presentation that is kind of just iconic and there it is all together it's beautiful the sauce just complements just enough it adds just kind of a look how juicy that is when you just push on you can just tell it's umpxious and juicy so when I just slice into it look at that it's just beautiful look at how it just falls apart it's so tender get a little bit of that sauce on there I'm excited [Music] that's so tender I think pork is underrated now one I grew up in Iowa and I still live there so that could be biased thing more so I think we just don't know how to cook pork properly and a lot of times we end up way over roasting it drying it out not having that real flavor so what we did here was we had a beautiful dry kind of Sandy rub to put on it with that garlic and the salt and the Rosemary and it really flavored it we let it sit on there for just a little bit you can just see how juicy it still is and then we roasted it low and slow to make sure we just brought it up to temperature not over roasting it and finished it by getting a crackly crispy skin at a higher Heat it's beautiful it's a great presentation you often ask what we do for Christmas eve of my family we make something special this is what it's going to

VwsblKHMCI4.json;hello again I'm chef Jon turns axe and this lesson to make roast rack of lamb parcel odd what does parcel odd mean it means a mixture of breadcrumbs garlic parsley and a little bit of butter or oil that you apply to different foods so I have an 8 bone lamb rack here and we're going to clean most of this off because we're gonna put some Dijon mustard on here and a breadcrumb mixture that we're about to make then we're gonna bake it over this mirepoix that I have sauteed with some rosemary thyme bay leaf and it has some garlic in it ready to mix in but it won't you put a little white wine on here the reason we're doing all this is we're going to make a traditional sauce out of whatever's in this pan after this roasting process is complete which is a systematic approach to salvaging any drippings in from any roast and applying it to the juice of the sauce that you're making that's what we're going to do this has some fundamental qualities to it making this dish okay so let's get this lamb rack trimmed a little bit here what does excess fat right here off keep cutting right along with it I take this off I have this belief that the least amount of fat that you serve with this kind of dish the better now can I leave the fat in between the bones I can or I could take the fat off the bones like so this is what I'm going to do is I want my bones nice and clean when we ultimately carve this this is two dinners this is an Eightball rack so it's pork chops per person here okay uh-huh okay take a little bit of extra fat off these bones this way all right now this amount of fat I'm concerned with too I don't want to have the person who's eating this half the battle between what's good and what's not good in each bite that they're cutting into so I'm going to take all of this excess fat off of here and I'd say that's just about enough off right now there's little portions like that that's okay okay so here's what I'm going to do I have two cups of plain bread crumbs here and I'm going to put about Oh a cup of chopped parsley in here I'm going to put a couple tablespoons of chopped garlic in here let's say three tablespoons of chopped garlic and I have some melted butter here now I'm gonna make let's get a little salt and pepper in here before I even continue a little bit of pepper and a little bit of salt there now we're going to add whole melted unsalted butter to this mixture until it's at the texture that we want in other words it needs to be like if you're from the north good packing snowballs because we're going to pack it onto the lamb racquet it needs to be able to adhere to the lamb rack first let's get it mixed up a little bit see it's starting to get a little pasty that's exactly what I want now you can make roast pork loin carsalot which I have done a lot by applying this to a pork loin that's a lot less expensive it's still equally as tasty let's put the rest of this butter right here I think in this case we had about a cup of melted butter okay that works for me we'll see how that texture is here it's I can let's just give that a taste for fun is it good nice and garlicky but not too garlicky okay let's sink this mixture that we have here and add a little bit of white wine to this band not much just enough to moisturize it during the roasting process at this point later we're going to be adding warm white and getting all the residue off of this after the roasting process is done okay so now let's look a little bit of salt and pepper on the rack now I remember this could be a pork loin or any other piece of meat you want to do this treatment to really now put some Jean mustard directly on this lamb rack like so it looks like a lot of mustard but it's not and it's going to help the breadcrumbs stick to it perfectly which is what we're going to put on here right now this parts a lot mixture by the way you can keep it your fridge and kind of use it for over a period of a couple of months if you want and just temper it and the defrost cycle to get back to the good packing state that this is now and I think we have enough on there we want to overload it because in the final analysis when we're slicing the lamb rack when it's all done if this is over packed with the partial odd mixture that it's going to have a tendency to fall off more when you're slicing it so we're going to put this in a hundred and seventy-five to 225 degree of it we want to cook this extremely slow so that the eye of the lamb rack is all one medium-rare temperature overdone so let's get this in the oven this is going to take probably a solid hour if not more at that temperature now I could cook it at 300 but I would call that speeding cooking it in a faster way that I need to the slower you can cook this if you think about it in terms of a miniature prime rib or something like that the better off you're going to be so we'll be back in about 45 minutes to check out it okay that rack of lamb has been in there at 200 degrees for two hours taking it out right now I've been pushing it with my fingers and saying okay this is done that's how I've been testing it so let's let's pick this rack up set it on this plate I didn't add any moisture to this smear pot throughout any of the cooking but it has whatever came out of that lamb is sitting in here now we're going to put this on stove and I'm going to throw some white wine out here so we could to glaze this this is up we're going to make a simple white wine Demi brown sauce ain't going to take too much of the glaze that about the glaze already okay so now let's light this up and we're going to make the sauce understand the first thing we're going to do is we're going to reduce this line this procedure that I am showing you right now is a very old-world standard principle in salvaging any flavors that are left over from any roasting process where the food is either put on a rack or not put on a bracket we're always systematically getting that flavor left it incorporating it into the final saucer juice so we let this reduce for about five minutes they're going to add some dummy to it then we're going to reduce that a little bit then we're going to strain it it sees it that sauce is going to be done so I'm gonna fast forward about five minutes from now be right back okay about five minutes worth of reducing here is what we've got as you can see about 75% of the white wines I'm not going to put a cup cup and a half of brown sauce demi-glace whatever you want you to put brown juice in here if you want to serve this with a nice juice we put this back on the stove bring that up to a simmer or going too fast over you through this for another three to five minutes then we're going to strain that sauce cut the lamb put it on a plate will be that simple so I'll be back in now a couple minutes okay the brown dummy and the white wine with the mirepoix it's cooked enough for me I'm going to strain it this lamb is still hot so the connection between making the sauce out of the residual from the roasting pan in terms of the amount of time if it's consistent with serving the land that having it's still very hot now I'm having to reheat or anything but now this is a little juicy and I'm okay with that doesn't have to be sauced assistant it's kind of like a cross between juice and sauce let's give it a taste this tastes good this needs a little bit of pepper it needs a little bit of salt and in this case I think this needs a small pinch of sugar also just that rosemary sometimes has that just is do I'm not making this sauce sweet by the way something that Rosemary's little there's a strong fight to and that's a way of kind of mellowing that out taste that nice okay let's put the sauce on the plate I have enough exactly here for a couple of orders have enough for one more order here we're going to put one on the plate here so let's cut the lamb and see how it looks so it's four bones fur this actually has seven bones but part of this lamb rack right here is missing this bone right here so I'm gonna cut this in half carefully because I want to keep the bread crumbs on the lamb rack how does that look oh boy that looks really good let's let's cut this carefully because we want to keep the bread crumbs intact here or the parcel I would set that down right there like that look at that probably should be using my French knife for this but I like this roast knife a lot push my French like that run into a little piece of bone there obvious and APSCo perfectly you see the way it's all one temperature that's because we cooked it slowly you could say that that's one dinner right there but if this was me eating this I would want this other at least one of these small pieces from this end here extends of that there you go there it's a nice rack of lamb dinner this is basic now - this is the an old traditional version but when I say basic I mean mirepoix underneath the roasting rack little bit of seasoning on the top looks good and how to salvage the juice from the roasting pan and get your sauce made I've and it's very very traditional way of going about so there you go roast rack of lamb parse a lot parse a lot being the crust that's on the top you get a chance to eat this which I'm about to do go for it thanks for watching;['segundos']

W1XELWKaCi4.json;- Hey, everyone. It's Natasha of NatashasKitchen.com, and today, I'm gonna teach you how to make the ultimate chicken pot pie. (funky music) You're gonna love that super. easy flaky, buttery pie crust, and wait until you see the filling. It's unforgettably good. Let's get started 'cause I'm hungry. (hands tapping) We'll start with a rotisserie chicken. You'll need four cups of. cooked, shredded chicken. You can use a store-bought. rotisserie chicken or try the easy recipe that. I'll link to in the notes. This is also a great way. to use leftover chicken or even leftover turkey, and you can use light meat or dark meat to make a chicken pot pie. You can use two forks. or just use your hands to shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Set that aside, and we're gonna do some quick. prep of your vegetables. Thinly slice eight ounces or. half a pound of mushrooms, and brown or white mushrooms are fine. For safer slicing, so the. mushrooms have a flat surface, cut the mushrooms in half. and then thinly slice. It may seem like a lot of mushrooms, but they do shrink down quite. a bit once they're cooked. Set those aside, and now we're gonna chop. up one medium yellow onion. And if you don't already have one, a food scraper makes food prep so easy. This is probably one of my. favorite tools in the kitchen, and I will link to it in the notes. Next, thinly slice two medium carrots. You should have about one. cup of sliced carrots. We love the flavor and texture. of the carrots in here, but make sure you don't. slice them too thick because they won't cook through properly. Another quick tip for. safety when cutting carrots, to make them more. stable, cut them in half, then thinly slice. Next, we'll mince three. large garlic cloves. The easiest way to peel a garlic clove is to first cut off the. end, then smash them, and smashing will help release the skin, so they peel easily. Once your garlic is finely minced, our last bit of prep is to finely chop one-fourth cup of fresh parsley. Once all of your ingredients. are prepped and ready to go, it's time to fire up the stove. Place a large pot or Dutch. oven over medium-high heat and add six tablespoons of butter. This is one of my. favorite Dutch oven pots. It's a five-and-a-half quart, and I will link to it in the notes. Once the butter is melted, add your diced onions. and your sliced carrots. Saute those together. for about eight minutes, stirring occasionally, or. until the veggies are soft. Next, stir in your sliced mushrooms. Then add your minced garlic. (funky music) Continue sauteing those. for another five minutes until the mushrooms are softened. Next, sprinkle the top with one-third cup of all-purpose flour, and stir constantly for about two minutes. The flour should be golden in color, and you're basically making a roux, which will help to thicken up the sauce. Next, add two cups of chicken broth and one-half cup of heavy whipping cream. Bring your mixture to a simmer, then continue cooking for another minute or until the mixture is a. thick gravy consistency. Just before you turn off the heat, add two teaspoons of salt and one-fourth teaspoon of black pepper, or season the mixture to taste. It's important to have. a well-seasoned mixture at this point. Now, add your four cups. of shredded chicken, along with one cup of frozen peas and one-fourth cup of. finely chopped parsley. Stir that together until. it's well combined. Then, take it off the heat. and let it cool slightly as you roll out your pie crusts. We're using two disks of. our homemade pie crust that we made the night before. These have been chilling. in the refrigerator, and homemade pie crust is. the easiest thing to make. You can use store-bought in a pinch, but I highly recommend trying homemade. Check out our easy video tutorial for the best homemade pie crust. I will link to that in the notes. Lightly flour your work surface. Then, roll one chilled pie crust disk into a 12-inch-diameter circle. One of the things we love. about this all-butter pie crust is it's really easy to roll and work with. You want to have a large enough circle to fit your nine-inch pie pan and hang a little bit over the edges. Here's our best tip for. transferring a pie crust into your pan. Lightly dust your rolling pin. with a little bit of flour to keep it from sticking. Then, loosely wrap the dough. around your rolling pin. Now, simply unroll your crust. right over your pie pan. Arrange the dough evenly. into your pie pan, so you have a little bit of. dough hanging over the edges. Then, pour your chicken pot pie filling that has been cooling. slightly over your pie pan. Make sure you get every last drop because everything in here is delicious. Spread the filling. evenly into the pie pan. And you'll be tempted to eat. the filling at this point. It is so tasty. Set that aside, and we're. gonna work on the top crust. Lightly dust your work again with flour and roll the second pie dough disk into a 10-inch diameter circle. Now, transfer that crust the same way and unwrap it directly over the surface of your chicken pot pie filling. Simply line up one edge and unroll. You'll see there's a little. bit of pie crust overhang. That little bit of extra. crust is a good thing. You'll need it to crimp the edges later. So tuck the top crust. under the bottom crust. I like to give the dough a little pinch to help it seal as I go. You can leave the edge like. this for a more rustic look, but crimping the edge is super simple. With one finger, press on the dough, then pinch the dough around it with the two fingers on the other hand. This creates a beautiful fluted edge. If your crimped edge is sticking up above the center of the pie, one trick I learned to keep. it from browning too much is just to pat it down. Next, cut five to six two-inch slits in the center of your pie. This will create vents. for steam to escape, To give the pie a beautiful. golden-brown color when it's baked, we're gonna. brush it with an egg wash. So beat one large egg. Then use a pastry brush. to generously brush it all over the top of the pie. Make sure to also brush. inside the crevices of your fluted edge. Lastly, because this is a savory pie, I love to garnish the top with. a little bit of coarse salt and black pepper. Now, bake the pie in the. center of a preheated oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit. for about 30 to 35 minutes or until the top crust is golden brown. If you notice the crust. is browning too quickly, you can create a pie shield. You'll need a square sheet of foil. Cut a four-inch diameter circle out of the center of the sheet and place it directly over the pie. (funky music) Once the pie is out of the oven, you'll want to let it. rest for about 15 minutes to cool slightly. Otherwise, the center will be piping hot. The hardest part about. making this pie is the wait. Thankfully, it's not too long. (laughs) I'm so excited. I have waited long enough. The pie is still warm and you want to be. It's gonna be perfect, trust me. Before we slice into this, I love to garnish with. a little bit of parsley, and that's what I love about. the cracked black pepper and the salt on top. Everybody knows it's a savory pie. Oh, yum, yum, yum. I think the first time. my daughter tried this, she was disappointed because. I told her I had a pie. She thought it was a sweet. pie, so she made a funny face. It's time to dig into this. I cannot wait any longer. Okay. We're gonna cut a big slice. Oh, goodness. I'm so hungry. And you can use a store-bought. crust if you really need to, but making a homemade crust is so easy. I mean, watch our video tutorial on this. You'll be impressed how simple it is, and it will beat a store-bought. crust all day long. It's flaky. It's buttery. It's so good. And we use the same pie crust. for sweet or savory pies. It is excellent. It's like our go-to. Actually, it's the only pie crust we use. So good. Okay. Here we go. Big old slice for me. (laughs) I'm excited. Oh yes, getting close. Look at this. It's like chicken in gravy. It is so saucy and loaded. This is the most satisfying. pie you will try. It's so good. And that filling has perfectly thickened, and so it's not gonna fall apart. Okay. I'm going for this. because I'm so hungry. Okay. Here we go. Yum. Look at that. Everything in this is so. delicious and mouthwatering. Mmm. And it's like a meal in itself because it has meat, it. has veggies, it has crust. Okay. Here we go. Mmm. Mmm. This is a home run. (laughs) So good. That crust, it is so flaky and satisfying. And what I love about this pie is the bottom crust does not get soggy. It's kinda weird, but it's perfect. It reheats really well. I'm telling you, you will hope to have. leftovers of this pie because the next day, it's just as good. Score one for Mom. I love the mushrooms in here. They're so tender, and. they add a lot of flavor, so don't skip them unless you. really don't like mushrooms. Add the mushrooms. Maybe you'll change your mind. And then the sweet peas. I love that little sweet. pop of flavor in every bite. The sweet carrots. So much chicken. And the chicken is super. tender in that gravy. It absorbs some of it. Oh, I keep talking about it. I keep thinking about taking my next bite. I can't wait. All right, we gotta... I gotta, okay. We'll see you in our next video.;['segundos']
wMqdiXL8gvQ.json;[Music] hi guys i'm laura batali on this episode of lauren kitchen i'm going to show you how to make a gorgeous easy and delicious like sausage stuffed pork loin which i know it sounds like a lot and it is very rich it's very delicious and it's perfect for your easter table or any special occasion i love this recipe the versatility is incredible i am showing you what i feel like are the basic ingredients that go really really well together but by all means feel free to be as creative as you want to be i'm using a pork loin it's lean it's delicious everyone seems to love it however if you can find a boneless skin on uh like shoulder pork shoulder you could roast that i love it it's definitely richer in flavor you have to cook it a bit longer you want it to reach about 205 or slightly over whereas a pork tenderloin or a pork loin like i'm using today i like to cook it to about 150 and it's perfectly juicy every single time now i've got about a four and a half pounder here i don't really need to trim a lot off because it's got a nice thin layer of fat which i want to keep because otherwise it's just way too lean and here's how you butterfly this is how i do it anyway by no means am i perfect at this but instead of slicing it halfway down you're gonna slice it in thirds so you're going to go to the top third like that don't go all the way through and it just takes a bit to maneuver because it is a really big piece of meat you're going to go about you want a nice thin layer on of the top and i'll show you why in just a minute so you open it up like a book you can see this side much thinner than this side so now over here you're going to go under and you're going to split that in half and you're going to open it up like a book i find it easier to work with one side at a time but really what i really love and i don't have a round bear is my little very sharp paring knife to do this with but it works you're just gonna go ahead and get this open like i said you're kind of gonna get it open like a book and it does not really matter if it's not 100 perfect because you're going to pound it out anyway and you just want it to be nice and even when you go to roll it because that's really the important part okay so once you have that third layer all sort of opened up like so you're gonna cover it with plastic wrap i'm doing this on my wood board but it is layered on both sides with plastic wrap you're gonna take your meat mallet and you're gonna pound it a little bit so that it's thinner easier to stuff easier to roll okay good enough you can see it's pretty much even all the way i don't know if you can really tell but pretty much even all the way i'm gonna go ahead and just move it to the side because i do need my board now because i'm hungry and i need to move quickly don't have my grater here so hold that thought so what i have in the skillet is a mixture of hot sausage and sweet pork cooked it because i wanted to render its fat i'm going to go ahead and pop the in a food processor because i want that to be extremely finely chopped now i know what you're saying lara i don't really want to add you know sausage in the thing that's a lot it's really rich you don't have to do a breading stuffing i'm going to show you i'm going to add bread i'm going to add cheese i'm going to add herbs and garlic you can just build on that you can just do an all bread and herb stuffing which is phenomenal you could add pancetta instead you could add raisins you could add dried fruit and they would be fantastic i'm just going to go ahead well there we go i want that really finely chopped your sausage is well crumbled to the same food processor this is just a couple of hoagie rolls um they're stale that end is a little bit tough i'm going to add a couple of them in here you want a total of about 8 ounces if you were to weigh it so about a half a pound of italian bread if you are using a sourdough or something where the crust is super super super thick then i may just want you to remove the crust but i'm just going to go ahead and do the same thing this is sort of like the breading portion right think of stuffing think of thanksgiving stuffing same thing let's see yeah that's good enough beautiful add that in okay now that's like the bulk right now you're gonna go ahead and take a few cloves of garlic i know that you could add garlic to a cooking sausage for some reason i just like when you add the garlic to the mixture when it's raw i think you get such a better flavor more you know more pronounced flavor a stem of celery now i listen i might have had a lot of coffee today but it could not have been that strong rosemary i'm just gonna take i'm actually gonna use two let's just go ahead and use two okay and then we're going to do a handful of parsley but first i want to go ahead and get my garlic peeled smashed peeled all the goods so we've got parsley rosemary garlic chopped up added in i'm not adding any salt to that because i'm gonna salt the pork itself and the sausage is very salty i went ahead and added some toasted pine nuts lovely texture beautiful nutty flavor just make sure you go ahead and toast them first to really bloom their oils and flavor lots of parmigiano you could also add pecorino and i would prefer it not gonna lie to you i would prefer it was i gonna make an extra stop at the grocery store this morning no because i forgot but i would really prefer some picorino because it's got really sharp sharp flavor and i think i would really like i know i would because i made it before without parm and i did picorino and it was fantastic so there's that so there is your cheese your bread your sausage i'm going to go ahead and add a little bit of vino if you don't want to add any dry white wine which i'm using some pinot grigio you don't have to you can go ahead and just leave it out completely and add some chicken stock which i'm going to but you can add all stock if you want to again think of what we are making as like you're making a stuffing right it's really no different it's just so delicious you want this to be nice and moistened but kind of hold together so that's looking pretty fantastic go ahead and season the inside of your pork well because we didn't add any salt to the stuffing but i do want to be seasoned well black pepper i'm going to go and go ahead and use my hands for this because i just feel like it's the easiest way oh yeah that is good stuffing and it's so good you know what i did with the leftovers and you have to trust me on this i know i'm gonna sound like a crazy person but i took leftovers and if you follow me on instagram you'll already know because you saw it i took leftovers sliced it really really thinly like shaved it pretty much and i made like a gravy with the leftover sauce and everything that i had made for the roast and i made hot roast pork sandwiches by char prolonged and broccoli rob let me tell you something i could open up a shop because they were so good oh my goodness okay i was listen even i was shocked at myself that's how good it was okay that looks phenomenal look how good that looks beautiful and the the stuffing really helps keep the pork nice and moist okay i want to move some things around let me go wash my hands really quickly because i hate to work with messy hands i'm turning it over to the side just because it's easier for me to roll i've got some kitchen twine here you want to start rolling you want the top to be where the fat cap is right because you want that to roast and render and do all kinds of magical things and you're just going to literally roll this like a jelly roll right and if some of the filling spilled out trust me it is fine it is fine and if some of it kind of tears open a little bit at the bottom trust me it is fine okay i'm going to leave it like that just for a second because i find it easier to i'm leaving it to the side because i find it easier to lay out all of my twine before i do pretty much anything else okay tie some kitchen twine all around like that you kind of want to keep everything in place keep it shape keep the filling from rolling out it's just a good practice okay it's a little bit of a messy job but you know it is very worth it you're going to have to trust me on that go and then we have one more piece i'm going to put in the very front here beautiful again keeps the shape keeps everything together beautiful beautiful beautiful i just wanna you know i don't function well in a messy cooking environment but when you're making something like this it's kind of like making thanksgiving dinner right when you are cooking for thanksgiving you know it is a disaster in your kitchen i do try to keep things looking smooth and nice and all that jazz but you know i don't know why that's in here because i don't need that i don't even put this over a wire rack or anything i plunk it right in here i take all the tops of the string because i have to cut them off anyway i take all of those and i just do it like so like i said i don't put anything alongside i don't need to however i am going to take a head of garlic in about because this is going to take about an hour so to roast i'm going to take a head of garlic i like to dry the top salt liberally the top the sides roll it around to season underneath and then pepper same thing roll it around to season the underneath take some chicken stock i was saying was this is going to take a bit to cook but in a bit i'm going to take a head of garlic and i'm going to throw it in there to roast alongside because we're going to want that later for the sauce a little bit of white wine i've got some rosemary tucked under there you know me i am a fan of the trusty trusty probe i like my meat cooked perfectly i'm going to set this at 150 which is perfectly safe for a pork loin so i'm going to go ahead and just set my temperature to 150 and when it's there it'll be done and then we will let it rest and we'll make our sauce to go with that's it 400 degrees and she goes whoa okay pork was in the oven it was actually in the oven about an hour now remember i told you i like to cook mine to the internal temperature of about 150 once it cools and sets for half an hour before slicing it will carry overcook to about 160 to me that is perfect if i were to take that out at 165 by the time you sit down to eat it it'll be 180 and it is gonna be dry as a bone however if we were doing this with a boneless shoulder cook it to about 205 to 215 because it's a different kind of meat so it's gonna need all that time to really break down and get tender think of it like when you cook a pulled pork or any kind of uh recipe that calls for a shoulder anyway to make the sauce it's very really really really simple i took a head of garlic and i roasted it alongside the pork loin until it's lovely and tender and delicious and i'm going to add it to my skillet here with some olive oil now you have to give me a second it's very hot i'm just going to squeeze it out whoa that's hot trying to squeeze it with my hand but i'm going to need a muffin that's going to give you really yummy oh my word rich garlic flavor i'll take the peel out let me get a smaller tonight to get the rest out you want all that really delicious sweetness there we go a little dried oregano dry basil situation now to this i'm going to add a bit of white wine if you don't want to use it leave it out let that just sort of reduce for a minute now what i have in here in my fat separator is the juices from the pork i'm going to go ahead and add them in don't add the fat just add the bottom which is why i put it in a fat separator because i don't want that because that you can sort of still see where there's like the good juices at the bottom and then the red like the fat sort of rises to the top we don't want the fat we don't want a really greasy um a really greasy situation nobody wants that crank that up i'm going to add a bit more chicken stock here just because i feel like we need it for the amount of pork that we are going to be serving and i'm going to just bring that to a boil and let it reduce by about half sauce looks great i'm going to go ahead and add a corn starch slurry which is just some corn starch and some water just mix it together it will thicken that sauce beautifully while that happens we can go ahead and start carving the the roast get that out of the way take some kitchen scissors you got to cut off that twine that's important i left one on look at that now i want you to see something i want you to see how beautiful the fat you know that little layer of fat cap is now i'm trying to see if you can hear it it's now crispy and gorgeous every single oven is different i have three ovens in my house they cook differently if i were cooking this not in this oven but in a different oven i would have to turn the broiler on for the last couple of minutes to get that really gorgeous deep crust they just cook differently so if you are at the one hour mark and you feel like your top is not looking like this turn the broiler on for a couple minutes and it will get there like i said every oven is different it's nearly impossible sometimes for me to give a correct estimate of how long something takes to cook because i test them i'm going to go over here because that that that one's the cook's treat but i want you to see how juicy it is can you see right there look at the juiciness you see that i really hope you can see it it is absolutely perfectly perfectly perfectly cooked it is such a pleasure to eat it really is not difficult to make at all especially when it comes to something like a stuffed roast it's one of the easiest i think to pull off it is such a celebration everyone loves it leftovers are so phenomenal whether you make hot roast pork or whatever you can make whatever you want everyone loves it you can make a hash make whatever you want this is mine cook street you always have to have one of those when i do go to serve this i am gonna go ahead and put some parsley but look at this you have to do a bit more fresh rosemary around and i'm going to decorate this really nice with fresh herbs and maybe some garlic you have to take some of this roasted garlic sauce pour it all over let it drink it up i'm just gonna pretend i'm gonna take that to the table which i really am but now just pretend that this is oh i just need that and crust need that crispy crust in that sauce with a little bit of the stuffing on top it is beyond delicious the stuffing keeps everything flavorful and moist chinatown go a lot and you get to come for the great recipe perfect for your easter table i really hope you enjoy spending time with me and i will see in the next one [Music] you;['segundos']

WnWnbyJN_i8.json;okay guys so here we have our chicken so we're going to do step one and us basically to clean the chicken you're going to be mixing in this bowl after you place your chicken in there you're gonna add your salt so we're gonna put some salt in here about two tablespoons of salt maybe three that should be enough we're going to add a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar say about two tablespoons should do add this border and you're basically gonna just allow the chicken to soak in the salt water or vinegar solution for an hour 30 minutes should do the job afterwards what we want to do is we want to rinse this off and then we're going to season the chicken so what you're going to go and do is you're going to rinse the chicken off rinse off all of that salt water vinegar solution so now it's time to season this chicken it's time to season the chicken we're going to season it with some seasoning so make sure you add a nice amount of this we're going to now add our adobo season to this like I said most people only use one or the other not many people use both but doable season and season the salt but I like to use both next we have some onion powder we're going to use a nice amount of that well it's chicken without pepper folks everybody seizes that chicken with pepper mix it in first we allowed us to sit for 8 to 12 hours and it's gonna soak up all of these good juicy seasons look at that and this is going to give you a chicken much more flavor so you're gonna add about 2 to 3 big tablespoons of butter to a pan let that melt and what you're gonna do you're gonna get your apple cider vinegar you're gonna add just a couple tablespoons of that I'll say about two tablespoons not much you don't have to cook this too long just want to steam it a little bit just like that to melt the butter we're gonna pour this over our baked chicken and just going to help the skin Brown and get that nice golden brown crispy skin topping that you you want your chicken 1/2 so that's all you're gonna do you want to use about three tablespoons of butter and about two tablespoons of vinegar and that's it more butter than vinegar just remember that you know the chicken that we seasoned last night and we're going to place that in the baking pan always cook my chicken on that side first then I turn it over on the skin side hmm and as I say in my other videos when I get done marinating much my food with my meats just look at how well seasoned the chicken is has a orange look to it that's not you can tell that your chicken been marinating for 1218 hours yeah we got two drumsticks two dots and five wins okay so we're going to do now is we're gonna get bad vinegar butter mixture that we mixed together and we're going to pour that into the pan what I like to do is when I'm baking my chicken I like I mean should I covered the tip of the wings so try to do that try to cover the tip of the wings because those are the pieces that kind of stick up once the oven get hot and they may burn a little bit nothing like burnt sits on my chicken so that's a cover if you can like righty I'm going to cover this try to cover the tips of the wings I'm gonna put this wing under here put this one under there and then cover this one with the thigh like that and then put this tip under here and make sure this tip is covered with this by this die and drumstick because you don't want chances it's a fine and that's what what happened if you don't cover okay so I'll show you guys how it would look after it's all done and it's nice and crispy and brown I'm gonna show you how the best the best be look I've already preheated my oven to 400 degrees I'm going to cut it down down to 350 degrees it was preheating for the last 10-15 minutes so now my chicken

X0mWqdccPJs.json;[Music] well hello there my dear friends welcome back to the scott reed project how are you doing so today i've got this wonderful piece of pork here this is a piece of loina pork traditionally where the pork chops come from as you can see we've normally cut in between these ribs slice it down there choppedy chop chop chop you have a pork chop but what i want to do today is to french trim this by that i mean we cut a line across there take that off i'll put that trim into sausage meat trim in between the bones and then we're going to roast it off as a joint so this is what i call proper pork pork as it should be just have a look at that in a minute so you've got that lovely fat on there fat is flavor always remember you need that on your meat yes you may not necessarily want to eat it you can cut it off but you will need it for flavor so without further of a do we're going to get our pig on and prepare this beautiful piece of free range british pork i mean who doesn't like roast pork i love the shoulder i love the belly like i said we would normally have this in chops but we're going to cook this so it's tender and it's juicy because a loin has a tendency a bit like a lego pork to dry out so cook the right way keep an eye on it look for that internal temperature and we are gonna have a corker so what am i doing then french trimming i want to take about that much off exposing the tops of the bones so i'm just going to mark it there so roughly you can see there repeated it the other side and as you can see we've made a mark so what we're going to do is just hold in the bone a nice sharp knife is imperative here we're just going to go down and then take it off the ribs beautiful absolutely perfect meat for sausage making and then that leaves us with this now you can judge it you can take it a little bit shorter if you want to i'm not that fussed so all we need to do is go in between each rib nice and gentle as you can see there down up down up again no waste absolutely no waste on a pig there's no excuse for it so there as you can see the knife is doing the work and up now do i want to take that a little bit further do i do i do i no so what we need to do then is concentrate on getting the rest of this meat off these bones i'm going to show you a nice little trick to save all the scraping look at that it's beautiful in it so we get off as much as we can with our knife this is an odd angle for me to work out because of the camera so take some butcher's twine it's tied double just make a little loop put it over the end of the rib make sure it's on nice and tight and pull and as you can see it pulls the meat off now there was quite a lot of meat on this so i should just go over them again but you will get all of that off it will save the blade of your knife so nice and tight and that by the time we've got a cloth on it will be pretty much as smooth as a baby's bottom so all i'm doing here then is scoring the skin what this does this allows the fat to render out and the skin to crackle what you need to do point of a very sharp knife you can do it in a crisscross diamond fashion i'm going old school just the tip of your knife not into the meat just opening up the skin just like that straight down lovely just look at that do that all the way along and then i'll show you the magic trick to get him good pork crackling every time so what's the secret then well we are already halfway there meat scored properly at room temperature and then salt that's it none of this putting boiling water over it or rubbing oil on it just plenty of salt into all of those grooves will drive out the moisture and as it's at room temperature it gives it a good head start so i'm just getting up any bits of salt just give it a nice rub in you could always put a bit of thyme in there bit of sage i'm just gonna keep it unadulterated so i'm just gonna weigh this then just to work out the cooking times we have got three pounds three ounces so first of all we need to get this into a red hot oven by that i mean an oven that is about 200 220 degrees c i'll put the conversions up there somewhere for an initial 20 minutes that will start the process of turning this lovely piggy stuff into nectar of the gods so a nice baking tray then with a spot of water in the bottom [Music] as you can see not too high up so the heat is going to hit it and then we put that straight into the avon 20 minutes robert is your mother's brother have a look at that and we're only 20 minutes in so just to reiterate then we pre-heated our oven at 220 degrees c if you ever got a fan assisted oven that's 240 so we let it sizzle on that high heat for 20 minutes 25 minutes what i've done now is turn my oven down to 180 degrees c what i'm going to do quickly is just put some little poor sign french letters on these bad boys so the bone doesn't look or withered like that chick madge from benidorm so yes cover them up safe roasting you know the drill so 180 degrees then i'm gonna give it about 20 minutes a pound so it's three and a half pounds so at least an hour hour and a quarter we'll probe it and see how we get on but look already starting to crackle my friends can't wait for this okay let's just have a quick look at this we got about 20 minutes cooking time left can you see that hey it's not only visible to the eye it's audible to the ear absolutely wonderful so we're looking for an internal temperature of 72 degrees what we got here bearing in mind we've got about 20 minutes left it's reading 48 so yeah it's looking good looking good i've got some lovely little potatoes going as well just with some sage thyme some garlic some lovely gravy some apple sauce but that's a bit later on just have a word of that okay my fine little porky friends have a look at that where's me tapping device so that's fully cooked so we did that 20 minutes at that high heat then turned it down 220 degrees we gave it about an hour i think it was an hour and 10 minutes all in we are looking for an internal temperature between 70 and 72. bearing in mind this has to rest yet and the residual heat will take it up another couple of degrees so we'll probe it in a minute to see if scotty still got the minerals but just listen to that let me take my mic off it's beautiful get the probe in i say it wants to be about 68 69 70. can you see that 71 yeah still got it baby so i'll let that rest for 20 minutes my potatoes are rocking so we get that in there that's seriously hot this is all gold it's pure pig liquid it is amazing you could use that to make your roast potatoes or whatever i'm going to stick it in there just look how rich and intense that is you could put that into a fat strainer take off the fat eat it on toast do your potatoes in it whatever it is amazing take the fat off put that juices in the gravy but yes doesn't look much now but wait until that's cool okay on to this bad boy next lightly tented for 20 to 30 minutes and what that will do is obviously when you put anything into heat it scrunches up gets all tense what this will do it will relax and all its natural juices will distribute evenly back through oh my god i just want to get into it so lightly tend to dance and we just wait for time to do it's dependable magic there she is just look at all those lovely rich resting juices take those off they've done their job i cannot wait to carve into this look at it it is a thing of beauty by anybody's standards small knife jesus christ look at that might have to do a bit of choppity chop chop oh look at it oh look at it it's yielding mom it's yielding wow that is just amazing we just need a few little accompaniments so we got our monumental pork chop there's a little basket there of palms per salad i think that's the word potatoes with parsley some beautiful applesauce and a shot of gravy oh okay it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it then we're just amazing so i put parsley thyme sage garlic granules actually but this this is something else hear that hey it's just amazing that crackling free-range pork if you can get it take some serious beating now we ain't going fancy here just a bit of that with me hands it's beyond good absolutely amazing definitely the way forward a bit of that what's going on in the gravy i have no words just amazing just nap that with a little bit of the rest and juices there's the gold that lovely creamy fat almost too good to have anything with it but we put a bit of that on get one of them on like that and if you open wide you can have a bit okay so i know you get loads of guys on the telly on youtube going that was amazing but i'm telling you that genuinely puts something out unbelievable and if you're not spoiled enough you get the bone the rib what would be rietz well that was seriously good and i mean seriously good i mean here at the srp there's no frills there's no pump and circumstance i don't even know if that's the right term

barbecue sauce very similar to this just the sauce and you can take on the barbecue this we're going to put it in the oven we're going to braise those short ribs with this amazing sauce that we're going to prepare remember the segment friends you have to if you want to cook with me first you watch the segment you see if you like it you want to cook with me you have to get all your mison plus and the best way to get it is let me get my towel first i got to clean my hands because i just touched the ribs um you gotta get uh you watch the recipe you like it good let's say you want to do it you go below the the video there's things a link it says see more you click on that you see it you download the recipe you have it printed and you do your mise en place it's a lot of stuff on this folks we got onion we got leek we got celery we got peppers we got garlic we got uh habanero but we got chipotle pepper and adobo sauce we got fresh herbs mustard tomatoes brown sugar vinegars mamma mia we got a lot of stuff this is not a quick quick quick thing to do but let me tell you this is going to be one of the best short rib you've ever had i promise you you're going to love it it's really really delicious bone in you want to do a bone out the one you can get like you can get some at costco they are bone boneless you can get those also they're wonderful i kind of like the bone in it's dramatic it's delicious and the bone gives you so much more flavor so first thing we're going to do is we're going to paint serum put in a flower get them beautiful golden brown and then we're going to make the we're going to make the braising container right here just checking the machine was hot enough i'm gonna start with a little bit of a garlic olive oil and then i'm gonna paint sear it the short ribs but i'm gonna do it with a clarified butter uh not regular about a clarified butter and in the essential we have a you guys gonna have to learn to make this now then our china channel is growing i want to teach you some new stuff and and clarify butter is a must to saute meat and all that so then you don't burn your butter and you don't burn your olive oil okay so it's much better to do we're going to make sure this is nice and hot we're going to paint serum and then right here all we're going to do is we're going to dust them with flour all the way around it you see and then we're going to get in beautiful golden brown and that's going to give us some really really wonderful caramelization right we're going to do that and then we're also going to get into the pot let me remove this get myself a moist rag and we're going to put them in here we're going to pen sear them and then we're going to make the sauce in here let me now wait further let me start making the braising liquid that's where the reefs are gonna cook we're gonna start with the onion remember onion is number first number one always and less what unless we got bacon if we got bacon we're using the bacon fat to saute the onion all right so then you put the bacon first let the fat render and then saute the onion but there's no bacon in here we certainly could have bacon in there but nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that you cannot oh mama mia don't get me started with bacon hey look it's not hot enough you see that this is number one ruler don't screw up in the kitchen leave it up to me i screw up okay so what you do when you do like that you just wait you wait i'm talking i'm talking and i didn't wait long enough so now i put the onion and nothing is happening that's because it was not hot enough you see i should have known you think i would know better after 50 years in the kitchen no something is wrong it's not cooking but we're going to wait for a few seconds [Music] well it looks like it's cooking now it's getting finely thank goodness took forever don't forget folks don't do it like i do i forget all the time things leave it up to me you know if i can make mistakes in the kitchen i make him i don't know about you but i make a lot of mistake in the kitchen he would think after 50 years i don't make any more no not me salt and pepper don't forget and now we're going to take those ribs friends and we're going to put them in and we're not going to touch them remember when you're cooking don't touch them leave them alone leave them alone don't touch it we're going to take this out of the way the onion are doing the thing this we're not going to touch i'm going to put almost salt and pepper in there and trust me that sauce gonna have a lot of salt and pepper in there i had put a bit of salt and pepper in the beginning in it and now i'm gonna put more so now let's go to this part right there let's see how we're doing with this you don't want to touch them unless it's really really starting to caramelize we want to make sure we caramelize the onions so they're nice and sweet okay that's really important friends we want to make sure those onions are nice and sweet and the only way they're going to be sweet and you know right now it happens to be the vidalia onion season the vidalia onion from georgia did i ever tell you i come from georgia no but i may have told you that but it's not true so but anyway have you ever heard of italian oh let me tell you there's a lot of sweet onion out there there's some from washington state that i wanted the guadalajara they're delicious also there's a lot of sweet onion right there but i have to tell you though i think uh vidalia are one of the best there's a lot of good one out there i don't want to offend anybody except our own or just the sweet all right fine you're on your own could be just the sweet i like the vidalia on you by the way talking about onion no don't touch it jump here don't touch it and i say that and i screwed it up see you don't want to touch it otherwise you lose that malar reaction you lose that carbidization and i don't want to lose it so um really really important if we don't have this so this friends basically here's what we're gonna do we're gonna braise embrace me submerged in liquid we're going to braise those amazing ribs in a barbecue sauce yeah we're going to braise them in a barbecue sauce you can serve with polenta you can serve them with uh we're going to serve them with a polenta cake today but you can serve it with mashed potatoes here serves whatever you want by the way you notice i'm not putting anything in there until they own your caramelized they're not so sweet right you're with me with this you're all with me right so that's why the onion always gone down first you see all of those wonderful cooks are there then put all of the stuff together all of the vegetables put together think about it celery leeks those are leeks by the way this is another onion you notice all of those people they put everything together at the same time you notice their onion never caramelized and if you think about it hey can we take a peek i don't want to burn them but it's not burning but it's not doing that great either let's see now we're gonna wait um where was i oh yeah i was with the onion so if you put your sea all the time you know the trinity the onion the celery and the carrots everybody puts all together and guess what what's in here what's in here 90 water imaging friends if you were to put a quarter cup of water in there you think your onion are ever gonna caramelize of course they're not gonna caramelize they're gonna stew and and then you're missing that opportunity because for all of you then cook there you know what i'm talking about right there this is nice and delicious deliciousness is that a world i think so so all right so look we're good right there we're gonna go in there hey you know i think these guys want to turn ah yeah they wanted to no kidding look at that you see how fast that went there you go that's what i'm talking about right there my friends let me just lower the heat a little bit because now it's on steroid all right so we're putting the celery in there all right then we're putting the leeks in there we're gonna put them in the same time yeah let's put the whole thing in there that's gonna be a lot of stuff in there boy let me tell you oh man it's gonna be delicious then we're gonna put some peppers let's put some peppers in there oh beautiful colored peppers whatever peppers you got don't be a dead hey cut them and oh by the way everything is not cut very small you notice that it's like medium dice because this thing is going to be in the oven for three hours friends three hours two and a half three hours right so if you cut it too small three hours later what do you got nothing right so look this is going to be really nice we're looking good friends i'm going to do it on all sides look how big they are they're going to do all side all side i'm doing it you see all sides and it's smoking i hope it's not putting too much smoke in here maybe we could do it to put it on the side over there i'll leave it here i'll leave it here we'll just pay attention to it all right so now let's make sure everything is going uh all right next ingredient here we got the aloe peanut peppers uh chipotle um jalapeno pepper you can put habanero pepper you can put whatever pepper you want you want to put a little heat in there okay now those peppers are not so hot so don't worry and it'll be everything will be in a recipe so you'll have it uh garlic you could chop the garlic but don't worry about chopping it because this is gonna cook two and a half three hours so you know this is gonna be nice and smooth it's going to be nice and roasted garlic flavor in it and put the whole thing in there it's only garlic right all right so here we go we cook it now what else do we put in here got a lot of stuff let me tell you a lot of stuff a little brown sugar just a little bit of brown sugar very little brown sugar all right then we're going to put some tomatoes in there friends we got beautiful beautiful chopped tomatoes it's italian tomato same tomato that i used to make my tomato sauce what else we got okay hold on let me make sure i don't burn nothing oh yeah it's looking good it's looking good you see we want to get on all side here friends see the color right there if you could be here smelling this he would say chef it smells delicious i agree um i got some uh oregano thyme and a little bit of rosemary just chopped fresh herb oh if i have time i'll show you how i keep my ears it's really important okay now this is really optional everything is optional really is chipotle pepper in adobo sauce i don't know if you've ever had that but that stuff is spicy man holy moly so the adobo sauce sometime is enough or you can put one of them now remember don't put too much too much light unless you're cooking for a church this is like holy moly that's enough right there you see that was almost nothing right did i put your brown sugar in there you already i think i did all right then we're going to put a little bit of maple balsamic vinegar if you have a if you don't have a maple balsamic vinegar then put a good balsamic vinegar in it just a little bit of it okay just a little bit my vinegar is sweet so it's going to go really really well in there let me tell you that sauce is going to be amazing and then we're going to put a little bit of beef stock let me turn these guys off because they're done and and then at the last minute we're gonna put some of that this is a a a maple flavored bourbon whiskey this is good we're gonna put at the end we don't need to put it now we don't need to put it now friends because if we put it now uh it's gonna all the alcohol is gonna cook up now some of you say always ask me he said well we if we can't have alcohol what do we do don't worry just don't put it in you can't have it it's okay you're not gonna miss it if you can't have it right a little bit of worcestershire sauce worcestershire sauce however you say it and believe it or not i'm gonna put a little bit of dry mustard i know i don't use it for very many things of course i don't use it from anything it's closed it's still closed you see so i'm gonna need a knife oh boy to open it up don't tell anybody but i have knife that i use just for this i gotta cut the paper that's all i'm doing with it i'm not opening a can i'm just cutting the paper because i can see already the knife police are there going oh my god he used the knife to do it but hopefully macaroni just a little bit friends just a little bit dry mustard i actually don't really use dry mustard for many things but in a barbecue flavor it just it's it does a little magic to it i think it's delicious so here we go we're done with this we're going to take them we're going to put them in there just like this bone side down to begin with and that's okay we can flip them later that's it let me take this out of the way put it right here so it's out of the way let me move this i can leave the pot here it's doing quite well here and now we're going to put stock we got beef stock in there folks and we're going to put the stock on it just like this now remember brazing that means then it's submerging submerging that's a new culinary term we're learning today we are submerging the ribs so they're gonna cook in the stock so depends on how big of a pot you have depends how many ribs you have you're gonna it's gonna determine how much stock you're putting in you see if you don't have a oh look at this look good or what oh yeah it looks great um uh let me let me just reduce this for a minute depends how much you have how big of your pot you have how big of your pot you have i think instead of my english improving it's getting worse it depends how big your body is will determine how much stock you need so have some on hand and you're going to say wow this is beautiful i know you're going to say that if you don't you should look look look look look look how beautiful that is is that gorgeous or what this is the stock that i um i made it's under it's on a website it's center essential because that's an essential thing the chicken stock the beef stock you got to make this you can put in the freezer and last you 17 years in the freezer approximately okay so um a little more salt and pepper now remember my stock friends my stock has no salt and pepper because i don't put salt and pepper in my stock you shouldn't have salt and pepper in a stock because a stock is something you use in the dish do you put the salt and pepper in the dish you don't put the store and pepper in there the reason why when you buy a store bought is full of sodium four five six hundred seven hundred milligrams of sodium per cup sometime is because they use the salt as a preservative when you make it at home you put in a freezer that's your preservative don't keep it no cooler you keep it in a refrigerator a week maybe maybe i won't even cook more than five days in a freezer 17 years like i live a year or two what else do we do with this now friend we take it we put a cover on it we got an oven at 375. i'm gonna take him and i'm gonna go and put him in the oven that's all i'm gonna do open up the dough pull pull the shelf take it over right there put it in the middle of the oven you see friends right there and forget about it forget about it for three hours not really you don't forget about it here's what you do you put it in there every half hour i want you to go in check it make sure it's all okay in there put the cover back on go in there another half an hour check and make sure it's okay flip them on the other side go back in the oven do it for two two and a half three hour however long it takes for the meat to start falling apart and when it does you're good to go at that point you may thicken the sauce a little bit you may um i'll give you some tips in the meantime we're going to close it for now we're going to cook it for two and a half three hours we're gonna do a thing we're gonna finish putting the bourbon at the end like i said you don't put alcohol in yours don't worry just don't put it in oh another thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna put a liquid smoke it gives you a nice little smoky flavor and you know this is a natural product it's made with ickery smoke really liquidy smoke and water this is this is natural product and i promise you it gives it just a little smoky test to it it's really really delicious and yeah and make extra because the sauce you're going to get out of there is amazing so you want to make it a barbecue we're going to make a video just on a barbecue sauce also if you don't want to make the short ribs okay so we're going to put it in the oven or we're going to put it we already put in the oven and we'll come back in two and a half three hours so go do something but remember to check them and then when we're ready to serve it i'm going to show you how to play them okay friends 2 hours and 45 minutes those guys have got to be ready let's check them out oh it's hot it's hot yes it's very hot friends oh yeah super super hot [Music] let's look at it and then let's determine a few things now a lot of people like the fat in it and if you want to leave it on there it's your fat you do whatever makes you happy i like to remove it so what i do is i take a ladle because uh you know they were lit they look beautiful but they were a lot of fat in there so what i do is i put my later on in there and i just push it down slowly and you remove a lot of the fat most of the fat if you notice inside that bowl i don't know if you can see inside that bowl but there is a little bit of stock right there the rest of it is all fat so you can do it at the same position same position you got to just push it down and if you notice just don't push too fast if you do too fast then you'll get all the sauce to go in there because what you have in there folks you have the barbecue sauce now some of you have watched my barbecue video and you you have your own barbecue sauce and you can serve them you can make it with whatever you want but this right there is the braising liquid that can turn into a beautiful barbecue sauce so you see look it's getting less and less and less right you notice and all this right there is all fat so i think we got most of it you see let me go over here now and see if i can get a little bit more on that side but i don't think so see i got most of it right there now some people said oh i like to eat that what then you go ahead it's your fats you eat it you do whatever makes you happy with it but i highly recommend you don't all right so now what do we do with this you can refrigerate it uh and and and and just throw it away don't throw it whatever you do friends with this you cannot throw this in the garbage if you throw i mean if you control this in the sink it's like a cholesterol for your plumbing i highly recommend your you throw it in the garbage congeal it will put in a refrigerator and when it's cold just throw it away in a garbage all right so now let's look at our ribs i'm gonna temporarily put them on a plate right now i'm gonna look at them the bones just came out you see the bone just came out all right see the bones right here see right there that's the bone right here we're going to take the bone and we're going to do the same thing and we did right here we're going to take it off and you're going to see why in a minute now i'm pretty sure this is a safe bone to give to your pet but last time i said that i got a lot of bad comments do not give the bone to your pet okay so then don't give it to them so i'm just going to take them out i'm going to size them up and now let's take the bone out now at this point friend you can very well just take this whole thing right there take another bone here we only have three yeah okay that's good i only have three bones now at this point folks this right there is delicious there's nothing wrong with this but the french training in me says jean-pierre you cannot serve this like this you got to make it look prettier so here's what i like to do like i do with my barbecue sauce i take that whole thing right there and i'm gonna strain it you see now i'm gonna get all the flavor out of it you see i'm gonna get all the flavor out of this imagine that now all the vegetables is now going to puree oh you know what i forgot to do i always forget to do that but that's why i got it here so i don't forget put it already quit smoking there you don't want to put the liquid smoke don't put it in and like i do on my backpack on my barbecue sauce i got this beautiful maple favorite flavored bourbon whiskey okay put a little bit in there not too much right like a mama box juicer like for my barbecue sauce and we're going to puree this puree puree puree puree until we have a very smooth okay look very important friend we want it to be very very very smooth okay very very smooth that's what we're looking for see very smooth you're gonna see well it's not very smooth i agree not yet but everything is so hot you could never eat it anyway now so all that stuff right here right now everything is going well okay how do we make this look pretty i'm going to show you in a minute friends i'll show you in a minute if you've seen my uh barbecue sauce recipe you already know what i'm going to do but now let me just test this to make sure it's good now nismo salt you know it's good time to do it now more salt yeah more pepper a little more whiskey and maybe you could use just a little bit more oop there you go more or less all right so now we're going to mix all this up and like the barbecue sauce we're going to strain it you don't have to strain it if you don't want to trust me it's going to be delicious straining or not straining it i promise you it's still going to be delicious it's just going to look better if you strain it that's all right let me test it again let me test it again friends let me test it again now it's good now it's good friends remember when you're looking for salt you want to find the salt you look for a salt you look for it and if you can't find it then keep testing yeah you will find it all right so now here we go friends let me take another pot it's a good thing to have all those spots in here put that right there but this little big right and now we're gonna take that ladle that we used and we're going to take this [Music] again like i say you don't have to do this you can skip it i'm just going to do a little bit okay because i can't do the whole thing otherwise you guys are going to think i'm taking too long i just wanted to show you that's all i want to show you how to do it and like i said if you watch the barbecue sauce recipe you know exactly what i'm doing all right we strain this look at this look at this i did it in a barbecue sauce so i'm not gonna waste too much of your time watch the barbecue sauce recipe you'll see what i'm talking about but look at the difference between this and this this and this you see granulated looking smoother silk looking then we're going to do like we do with a barbecue sauce like we do at the barbecue sauce put a little spoon in there just put a raw butter in there yeah just put a little butter in there the butter is going to give it a smooth filling uh yeah it's going to make it shiny it's going to give it an exciting shine to it let me tell you friends this is going to make the ribs amazing you see make sure you melt it all right there i could have taken a whisk that would have been more professional ah you can rub that sauce all over your body no no okay how do we gonna serve this we're gonna serve that a long time ago and i'm sure a lot of you would have been very happy but you know sometime i complicate the issue i got my oh well i don't know if you've seen it but i made a video on how to make a goat cheese polenta and in the video i show how to make uh how to make it into a polenta cake so i got it in the oven i made some polenta cake and what i'm gonna do now i'm gonna take one of those polenta cake and i'm going to put it underneath the rib that's the exciting part let's find one that is uh then it's behaving that it's not too crooked this guy's fine see right here this guy's perfect right there right so we're going to take this we're going to take a polenta cake then we think it's going to fit make sure this is clean make sure this is clean and we're going to go in take a polenta cake put it right there this could be mashed potatoes this could be whatever makes you happy and then we're going to take that short ribs right there friends i'm gonna put right on top of it just like this just like this and then and only then oh i messed up the plate we're gonna take a spoon and we're going to be very very gentle with the sauce we're going to put just a little bit of the sauce on top you can put a lot of the sauce if you want it's really up to you friends but i'm going to put just a little bit of the sauce you put as much i got to clean this up or as little of the sauce as you want we're going to put a little bit of this we're going to get like a parsley leaves somewhere i got i had a couple of them here earlier right there and this friends is something you can do at home this is easy this is not difficult to do at home right there you can do it this way you can serve it with noodles you can serve with papadela pasta you can serve it with rice you can save with polenta you can serve with a soft polenta in a bowl however you serve it i promise you this short ribs is gonna be amazing right there absolutely gorgeous wow i almost forget the favorite part of the day i gotta test this thing i'll show you but it looks like it oh baby look at this look at this friends look at this look at this oh man look at this this is going to be so amazing probably going to be very hot so i got to be careful oh wow oh baby the sweetness of the barbecue sauce that thing melts in your mouth you know this rook i put it in look at this i put it in and it literally literally melts in my mouth literally

YYY57ScIVUA.json;this week's take on fresh fish is fried cod battered and breaded homemade tartar sauce but what really separates it is the fish market where it comes from let's dive in [Music] fried fish fried coffe who doesn't love fried fish right and so I live in Louisville Kentucky and fried cod is one of the biggest things there is this is actually a lot of people don't know this the biggest fried cod market in the world is in Europe second-biggest the Ohio Valley so Cincinnati up towards Indianapolis Louisville you know we happen to be in all three markets but it is hugely popular mainly because of how many Catholics there are in the region and during Lent candy meat on Fridays and so they have fish fries and what do they normally fry is Cod but Cod is it's very very important there's all kinds of different Cod out there if you can find it you always want to get North Pacific cod this is way up Alaska you know during the in the Bering Sea stuff like that that's the best cod or North Atlantic cod like near Iceland you know one of those two areas those are the two best areas sometimes there'll be some from Asia and things like that you really want to avoid that if you can but one of the things you want to do you want to make sure that it's as fresh as you can possibly get it because sometimes they actually add chemicals and things like that to that so like we've talked about when you're talking at your fish market or you're talking to the fishmonger ask the questions and then you'll see but what we're gonna do today is a classical fried fried cod and here's the deal so a lot of people like battered fish a lot of people like breaded fish so to make that argument easier I like to do them both at the same time and what we're gonna fry in is peanut oil peanut oil has a high smoke point so you want to make sure you get the oil to about 360 degrees and the reason why you go to 360 is because when you put the cold fish in there it's gonna bring the temperature of the oil down so what you do is I cut that I had a big fillet of cod I cut it into individual sized pieces you want to dip it in the batter and you want to get that nicely coated and I use a batter called Weisenberger fish batter mix you can use whatever brand you like the best this one just happens my preference and then I like a cornmeal bread so you you dipped it in the batter and then you're gonna do what they call dredge it in the breading and you just want to make sure it absorbs all of that breading that it can [Music] where did that two more times now one of the other keys to some people like cocktail sauce with their fried fish some people that ketchup I'm a tartar sauce guy damn you like tartar sauce tartar sauce is super super simple to make and we're gonna make some here in a little bit don't buy it in a jar I mean if you have to you can but it's just so much better if you make it yourself and when I look at when I buy my fish I like to get it at a fish market or someone that has it really has a dedicated fishmonger or something like that just because they know more you know a lot of times with you bite at the grocery store whoever's working in that seafood counter they might be a brand new employee they don't that you might know more about fish that they do but not only that they may not sell as much fish as a dedicated fish market would so you're you're subject to get fish that's not quite as fresh as the rest so our oil is ready we're getting ready drop alright so we got the oil good and hot get your tongs okay I normally put them in by hand but I can't do it's too hot for that so while that's going I'm gonna go ahead and make the tartar sauce hello and by the way those sized pieces of fish which I'm gonna guess they're about 4 to 5 ounces each they take about three and a half to four minutes to cook so I'm on a time so here we've got looks like about three-quarters of a cup of mayonnaise my personal preference on the mayonnaise is Duke's some people like Hellmann's some people like Kraft some people like whatever store it is Duke's is just something that I learned way back to the restaurant business and that's what I like to use and then then what we're gonna do is just a few capers and it's okay if that juice from the capers gets in there it'll taste better and then we're gonna do a sweet pickle relish and what you're going to do with the sweet pickle relish is you're gonna start out with one heaping tablespoon and then go from there because you can always put more in you can't take it out and then what the kicker for me is the next three things and what that is it's just a few dashes of hot sauce [Music] some pepper and some salt and mix that up now I'm making it now while we're frying the fish but I'll tell you this if you mix this up a few hours before then it'll actually come out better because that the flavor will start to incorporate I'm actually add a little bit more relish [Music] and that starters off is ready alright it's been about four minutes or so fishes ready you want to be very very careful obviously because the oil is very hot actually first thing you do turn the fire off chop that off take the fish out let it drain for a little bit and then I like to let that just sit on a paper towel just for a minute or so it's plenty hot it'll stay plenty hot for sure [Music] [Music] so you've got a

over here you see a little bit more a little bit more see they're getting their friends we want them to buy some nice color now you see why it's very important to make sure then they are um parallel this is my geography class parallel i used to get confused parallel horizontal in english i got it so confused for so long i would tell people things are parallel when they were arizona i told them they're horizontal when they were parallel and uh they got all confused actually let me tell you you should have heard me when i bought my restaurant 1976. july 26 1976 i'll never forget before i bought my first restaurant i was 24 years old and i oh mamma mia look at me i'm talking talking talking you see you come back over here see okay that's okay it's a little uh suntan a little bit of suntan here you see that's okay um and i bought the restaurant and my english was very bad very bad very bad and i bought a restaurant and then it was a lovely lovely restaurant it was called zenni's years ago and i turned it into a french restaurant but when i bought it it was a fondue restaurant they're specializing in fondue and the staff was as lovely as they were and they didn't they didn't understand anything i said to them it was difficult to run a kitchen when uh when nobody understood what you were talking about let me tell you there we go friends that's it so i am much better today with my my english much much better here we go that's it okay so you see a little squeeze here but that's okay i don't care i don't care we are mount friends all right so now look this guy is ready to go right a little more fresh thyme i'm gonna put them in a 325 degree 350 degree oven just like this that's all i'm gonna do okay they're gonna go in the oven now the oven is hot no more than three just do 300. just do 300 then you don't have to worry about it how long do you cook them for you cook them until they are soft with a with a fork than the fork tender right then i'm gonna make a little mixture with cheese now you don't have to be using all those cheese okay brie i removed the rhyme of the debris uh goat cheese i i love uh no this is this is um um yeah this is goat cheese i have two goat cheese i don't need two goat cheese little little cream cheese or um or mascarpone cheese that'd be great right a little garlic a little garlic a little bit of chopacity up little chopped pasta not not much and then what we're gonna do make sure those cheeses friends are well mixed together we're gonna put some fresh black pepper cracked black pepper we're gonna put a little salt okay and then we're gonna make this mixture right there friends debris is gonna be so important take your time to mix this take your time to mix it i'm gonna take a little more time to do it off camera and then i'm gonna take it i'm gonna put them in a pastry bag and when they're out of the oven we're gonna do one more thing to them we're gonna put the cheese in it and we're gonna put them back in the oven for a few minutes so cool thing to do you can make them way way in advance when they are and when you serve dinner all you got to do is pop them in the oven just for a few minutes to reheat them they are amazing i promise you you're going to love them so we're going to wait until they come out of the oven and then i'll show you how i stuff them all right so we're going to wait it's probably going to take about 45 minutes i'm not sure exactly how long we're going to time it right now because i never timed it when i made them in a little pot like this so we're going to find out and i'll tell you exactly how long it took to make everything i made about eight of them okay so i'll be back in a few minutes okay friends i took them out a few minutes ago you gotta let them cool just a little bit so you need to handle them because you see you see some of the stocks is in there right there or your water sometime you want to take them carefully carefully and you flip them you see you just flip them like that all right so here's what i'm gonna do friends i'm gonna do that to all of them and i'm gonna let them rest until because they're still quite hot i'm gonna let them get cool a little bit like maybe uh affair and this process you'll have to do but that's okay because you can make them all ahead this is not a potato the kids are hungry oh let's make some stuffed potatoes it's something you make in advance for a fun dinner or a very special dinner party all right so i'm gonna do all this and we'll come back i'll show you how i put the cheese in there okay okay friends well they rested a little bit long enough anyway uh for me to be able to handle them you know there's no more water inside um and you want to keep some of the chicken stock i wash the dish because i'm too anal so i i have to wash the dishes i mean nuts all of them anyway i got it cleaned up and then i saved some of that beautiful broth in there because you want to keep a little moisture underneath right now the cheese friends i put it in um in a pastry bag i got those disposable pastry bags if you don't have one of those you can you can use a very small ice cream scoop if you have it uh if not you're gonna have to do with a spoon or or get one of them baggies and put the cheese in a corner of it and then you just you see you can just do it like this it's e it's easy when you see me do it with a pastry bag you're gonna go ah it's pretty easy to do it this way right and you just go right here i just want to make sure that i'm not in the middle of the camera but look see right there and you put it in there now don't be afraid friends you want to put a lot of cheese so you put your pastry back in the bottom until it stops puffing up you see you want the potatoes to be full full full now it all depends of course how much cheese you like in your potatoes now if you like a lot of cheese you want to you want to really be healthy with this if you like a lot of cheese friends and you want you want to make a bigger hole but be careful be careful friends because if you put too much um if you put too big of a hole the potatoes are going to be very fragile because you know they're cooked right that's the whole idea right so then what we're going to do we're going to bake them and uh and and then when it's golden brown we're ready to eat them so then a party you got them all ready like that and you put in your steak you're putting you whatever it is they're going to require defense like those right now are still hot so they're not going to take that long at all to uh to get ready to be served but if you take them out of the fridge you want to put them in a warm oven like 250 275 until they're golden brown and until the cheese is nice and hot then you you taste it inside and they're ready all right we're gonna go in the oven now all right let's go let's put them in and voila we'll be back when they're ready okay friends now they are ready now what i'm going to do is uh let's put a chop a little church opacity to make them nice and give them a brightness a brightness a little freshness on and uh voila right a little bit right there this guy didn't get any right right okay so now um now they're ready to eat uh by the way i just wanna let you know the cheese left over i added on a crackers for lunch today at cheese and crackers yeah cheese and crackers it's delicious i'm not gonna have one otherwise i can't speak but it's delicious so yeah you make some extra cheese let me tell you okay i'm going to take one out of it so i want to show you the inside friends but they're going to be a little hot so be careful be careful be careful you know you see you you really got to keep the bottom of this thing moist uh it's nice okay oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so when you break them and you see that it stays so you see the cheese the the cheese came up a little bit you want to make sure you fill them up all the way okay now you can also put a bit of parmesan or vagina but you have to be careful because the parmigiano reggiano is going to um to brown really really really fast so you see the cheese is melting it's coming out but you're not supposed to eat them like that you're supposed to just cut them and just yeah no i gotta wait until they're not so hot fantastic for a dinner party i hope you make them my friend i really enjoy making them for you remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we got more recipe coming up thanks for watching [Music];['segundos']
ZbyFoxGr01o.json;[Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel so today's recipe is this beautiful and perfect roast chicken if you like to know how i made this then please give orchard so the first thing i will be doing is to mix my dry rub for the chicken and for this i will be using some black pepper garlic powder raspberry smoked paprika ginger powder bouillon cubes onion powder salt and some thyme [Music] and i'm just going to mix this thoroughly and then i will set aside for years later you don't have to use every single spice that i use here you can use pretty much anything that you want this is just what works for me so i've got my chicken here and it is approximately 2.5 kg and i'm just going to get rid of the extra moisture using some kitchen towel [Music] and at this time i'm just going to spray some cooking oil on the chicken and massaging dip into it you can use pretty much any kind of oil that you prefer you can also use butter [Music] and once the chicken is well oiled i will begin to coat it with the dry rub again i will make sure that the chicken is well coated and at this time i'm going to lift the skin around the chicken breast separating the skin from the meat and then i'm going to apply some of the spice rub into it and make sure that it penetrates deep into it and that is for absolute flavor [Music] and once the chicken is well coated i will be covering it with some cling film and i will leave this to marinade for about four hours you can do anything between one to 24 hours but i'm pressed for time so i will just be doing about four hours and after marination this is what the chicken looks like and at this time i will begin to add a bit more of the spice rub onto it [Music] and after that i will begin to stuff the cavity and to do this i will be using some garlic a little bit of lemon and some thyme [Music] so [Music] and after stuffing the cavity i will be tying the chicken legs together with a twine if you haven't got a twine you can use some dental floss or some foil [Music] and at this time i'm going to transfer my chicken onto my baking tray and then i'm going to cover it with a bit more oil now you can also use butter for this if you prefer now i elevated my tray using a rack you don't have to use this you can use some onions or pretty much any kind of vegetables that you prefer i just prefer to use a rack instead and after doing this i will be transferring the chicken into my preheated oven my oven is preheated to 190 degrees celsius and i will be baking this for 30 minutes so this is just a bonus it's not part of the recipe at all but because i'm aware that some people would want to know how i made my super gorgeous vegetables as well i'm just going to quickly show you so in here i've got some red potatoes as well as carrots and to this i will be adding some oil and also about two tablespoons of the dry rub and just in case you're wondering why i didn't just do a one pan dish that's roasting the chicken and the potatoes in the same pan well when i'm working with whole chicken i really don't like to do that and that's because of the long cooking time and also sometimes you end up with soggy vegetables and i really don't want that i prefer my vegetables to be a bit dry and i know some people do that because of the chicken drapings you know because because it tastes really nice for the vegetables but trust me if you season your vegetables right if you do it properly you won't miss the chicken drippings at all so after that i'm going to place this in my oven for about 45 minutes at 190 degrees celsius and after 45 minutes this is what it looks like absolutely beautiful this potatoes honestly they taste absolutely gorgeous and i'm just going to set this aside for when the chicken is ready and we're back to the chicken so this is what it looks like after 30 minutes of roasting absolutely beautiful at this time i'm just going to test it with some of the oil in the pan just so it doesn't end up being too dry and then place it back in the oven so the total cooking time is 90 minutes so you will need to do this twice during that time so like i said i'm going to put this back in the oven and after an hour and a half this is what it looks like absolutely beautiful isn't it and the best way to check for donuts is to stick a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh if it comes up reading anything between 165 and 175 degrees celsius then you know that it is ready and just look at that isn't this the most beautiful roast you've ever seen be honest and here it is served with the potatoes and carrots all you need now is some really good homemade gravy and you're good to go [Music] how gorgeous is this chicken just see how beautiful succulent and juicy it is falling off the bone i mean it should be on your christmas menu there is no reason at all why it shouldn't be and please if you try this recipe do let me know how you get them by leaving me a comment and do not forget to subscribe to my channel and also like this video as well share with your family and friends and i hope to see you in my next video bye [Music] you;['segundos']
Zi2B4a52Q7E.json;- Today, I'm gonna show you. how to make a roasted beef tenderloin with an. irresistible mushroom sauce. (upbeat music) Ooh, hey everybody, it's. Natasha of natashaskitchen.com, and this beef tenderloin is so juicy, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and. it's easier than you think. Plus that mushroom sauce makes this absolutely holiday-worthy and I'm hungry, so let's get started. (fingers tapping) For this recipe, you'll need. a two-pound beef tenderloin that has been resting at room temperature for one to two hours. I have a whole beef tenderloin. here that I've cut in half to get my two-pound piece. A whole tenderloin does. have a pretty uneven shape. So if you get the tail. end, you'll need to tuck that flap underneath, then. tie it for more even roasting. The other end is usually thicker and may need a little more cooking time. Either end will work in this recipe. And here's a great tip. If you want the most even cooking, ask your butcher for the. center cut tenderloin. So before you start, make sure to thoroughly pat dry with a paper towel. Now use some kitchen string to tie your tenderloin into an even shape. I'll show you a couple. of simple tying methods. You can either tie a knot,. then loop it around your hand, loop it around the roast. and continue looping around your hand and the roast. until you get to the end. You want those loops to be about every inch of the tenderloin. Also keep those loops nice and tight so you can form an even. and smooth cylinder shape. Once you reach the end, tie a knot and cut off any excess string. Another method of tying,. and one that's probably slightly easier, is to. lay out your strings about an inch apart for your roast, place your roast over the. strings and tie them tightly. Now that our roast is. prepped and ready to go, we're gonna make our garlic and herb rub. You'll love how simple this is, but the flavors are perfect. for beef tenderloin. You'll need to strip one tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves from their stems. We're gonna use half a. tablespoon for the roast and half a tablespoon later. for the mushroom sauce. Finely chop the thyme and place half a. tablespoon in a small bowl. Also finally mince your garlic. You'll need two garlic. cloves for the sauce and two garlic cloves for the roast. Don't forget to preheat your. oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with the rack in the center of the oven. Add the two minced garlic cloves to the same bowl as the thyme. Also add one and a half teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of black pepper. Stir that together to create a. flavorful rub for your roast. Transfer your tied tenderloin to either a cast iron skillet or. any oven-safe skillet. You can also use a roasting pan. Now, rub that garlic and thyme seasoning all over your tenderloin. You'll love this rub. It gives the tenderloin amazing flavor, and it's really simple to make. Once the tenderloin is evenly. seasoned, you're gonna drizzle on about two tablespoons of olive oil. After the olive oil is on, I like to turn the roast in. the pan to make sure all sides are evenly coated in oil. Now the key to getting. a perfectly-cooked roast is to use an oven-safe thermometer, and I will link to the one. we use and love in the notes. Insert that into the thickest. portion of the roast. Then we're gonna put it into the center of a preheated oven and bake. at 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The baking time will depend. on the thickness of your roast and your desired doneness. I like to bake for about 28 to 30 minutes for medium doneness, and. that'll get it to an internal temperature of about. 130 degrees Fahrenheit. You'll wanna remove. the roast from the oven about five to 10 degrees before it gets to your desired doneness, since the temperature. will continue to rise once it comes out of the oven. While the roast is in the oven, we're gonna move on to the mushroom sauce. Start by thickly slicing two pounds of Baby Bella or brown mushrooms. Also finely chop half. a cup of yellow onion. Onion adds great flavor, and if you finely chop it, it. will disappear into the sauce. (music intensifies) Our temperature alert just. went off for the roast, so we're gonna pull that out of the oven. Now transfer the roast to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. You'll want that to rest for about 15 to 20. minutes before slicing it. You can keep that. temperature probe in there and you'll see it continues to rise about 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, even after it's taken out of the oven. Now we're gonna start. cooking the mushroom sauce. Place a large heavy skillet. over medium-high heat and add two tablespoons of. butter and one tablespoon of oil. Now add the chopped onion and. your thickly sliced mushrooms and saute those together,. stirring occasionally for about five to seven minutes. You'll want the onions to soften and the mushrooms should. be lightly browned. Initially, the mushrooms will look juicy and release a lot of liquid. Let that evaporate, and then you'll see the mushrooms start to turn golden. Now add two minced garlic. cloves, your half a tablespoon of thyme that we chopped earlier,. along with half a teaspoon of salt and half a. teaspoon of black pepper. Stir those together for another. minute, until it's fragrant, then transfer the mushroom. mixture to a separate bowl. Place that same skillet. over medium-high heat and add half a cup of dry red wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it and continue cooking for. another couple of minutes or until most of the wine has evaporated. Add one cup of beef broth. and continue boiling until that's reduced by half,. about five to seven minutes. Once that has reduced to. about half a cup of liquid, you're gonna add half a. cup of heavy whipping cream and your sauteed mushroom mixture. Stir that together,. bring it back to a boil, then reduce the heat and. let it simmer for another two to three minutes or until. the sauce has thickened. Season the sauce to taste if needed with a little bit of salt. and pepper at the end, and it's ready to serve. All right, it is party time. Our sauce is done. Our meat has been rested and it is time to slice and serve. Okay and super important. to let that meat rest, otherwise it'll juice. out when you slice it. We've got our carving set. And before you cut it, you do wanna remove those strings. So we're gonna do that first. (music continues) Now to slice up the roast. Make sure when you slice. it's about a half inch thick, you don't want them to be too thin or they'll cool down quickly. So here we go. Oh yeah. And that is perfectly cooked. That's what I love about. this recipe is you can cook it to whatever doneness you like. Most beef tenderloins. will have a slimmer part and a thicker part, so you'll have one end that's a little more done than. the other, which is great, because some people just. like more well done. Oh, take a look at this. It is so juicy and tender. I'm telling you, this is like melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Take a look inside here. And you can tell this beef is just so tender and easy to slice. And if you don't have a great carving set, I will link to this one. that I'm using in the notes. I've had this one for. years and it's great. Perfect for turkeys, any kind of roast. And of course, beef tenderloin. Okay, once it's all sliced up, we're just gonna transfer. that to a platter and serve it with the mushroom sauce. All right, last but not least, we're gonna add the mushroom sauce and just for prettier presentation, I do like to fan out the. tenderloin slices like so, so that they cover more of the plate. It's just pretty, totally. optional, but we like pretty. I mean, it's a beef tenderloin after all. You got to make it look nice. (chuckles) And this really is such an easy recipe. All right, we're just. gonna dress it up now and look at these saucy mushrooms. So delicious. (music intensifies) All right, wanna make sure to get every bit of that mushroom sauce on there. Hmm, it's so good. (giggles) And then, I do love to garnish this with a little bit of fresh thyme, 'cause this does need. a little bit of color. You don't wanna eat the fresh thyme just saying, (giggles). it's not that great fresh. Okay, here we go. It's taste test time. I am so hungry and this smells so good. We're gonna serve this up. Here we go. Got our little steak knife ready. And of course, pile it. high with mushrooms. There's a lot of mushrooms. here and you will be so happy that there's a lot of mushroom sauce. Look at that. Yum, yum, yum. (giggles) I'm giddy and excited, can you. tell, all right, here we go. You have big piece, wow, it is so tender and it just cuts through. like butter, like butter. Got a little bit of mushroom,. a little bit of steak. Look at that. You can see that mushroom. sauce is just going right into that steak,. yummy, yum. (chuckles) All my steak dreams are. coming true right now, mm. Mmm. Mm mm-mm, mm. This has amazing flavor. You can really taste that little hint of wine. in the mushroom sauce. And I love that there's. a creamy sauce over this. It's almost like a gravy. except the best tasting gravy. This is so good. And make sure you serve this with something like. creamy mashed potatoes, and we have a really good video recipe. I will link to that.

the channel and ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna make it right now together [Applause] well hello there friends let me show you how easy it is i got some onion going over there i'm doing this in my uh cast iron pot i love those those are phenomenal the cook you put them in the oven you put them in the stove you put them whatever you want so what we're gonna do here friends we are going to um uh coat the uh the osobuco look how beautiful they are pure macaroni i got this from butcher shop because grocery store if you if you can't find veal via also book my friend you can make it with a lamb or you can also make it with the beef the beef you gotta cook over three days though but you can also make it with the lamb okay so it's much less expensive or pork pork pork you gotta make it with a pork okay so we got some black pepper in here we're gonna flavor the uh the flour then we're gonna put in it because that's a traditional way of doing it and um we're gonna put some onion salts you can put some garlic salt in there if you have and i also like to put a little bit of fine cornmeal and that's going to give me some nice uh uh uh crunch around it i use the cornmeal a lot uh and plus you serve this with a a goat cheese polenta or a risotto okay very simple to make it's expensive when you get the veal from especially these days um let me check the oil to make sure i'm at the right temperature here i'm looking for 365 and i'm not there yet and that's cool we're now going to take our oh it's a book right here look how big those things are and we're going to coat them with a flower we're going to roll them all the way around it we're going to use this flower mostly for a thickening thickening of sauces and uh you hear chefs tell you that it seals in the moisture moisture now it doesn't it doesn't stealing anything it's just a nice crust around it and it's a traditional old-fashioned way of doing it so we're going to do it the way everybody my mom makes it everybody makes it that way all right so we're going to go in the oil i got a garlic olive oil going over there and we're going to put that in there just like this and make sure the oil is at the right temperature and we're gonna get a beautiful golden brown color okay now let's go back to the other pot we are done with this area um yeah i put the pepper in there yes okay very good all right so i got onion here and friends uh the onion i already started to caramelize we wanted to be big uh uh chunks of onion meaning i daisy onion really big because remember this is braised braised means we're going to submerge the meat that's the way you do a brisket that's what you do you do any braised meat you submerge it with liquid and the liquid of course is we're not going to use the water mamma mia i see so many people online using water these days they put water in everything water water you know what i think on water that's like nothing so we're gonna put the um the onion in there and then we got carrots um that are cut kind of big also you see because this is gonna cook for a while so they cook big and so they're gonna they're gonna take a little while to cook and celery and i got whole garlic cloves and the whole garlic cloves they're gonna melt i mean they're gonna when you poach garlic it's kind of like when you roast it it's very mild we got some thyme and we got some rosemary that's actually rosemary here that's the time right here i got a can of um peeled uh tomatoes you know i use lava tomatoes wonderful i got tomato puree in here uh and we're gonna put at the end uh olive and lemon that's my way to do it we're gonna put a white wine uh and we're also gonna put a little bit of pork wine you know that's my signature i like to put a little assert a fortified wine like a port or my dad gives a little sweetness to it it's delicious and and then olives and uh so we're gonna put the stock in a minute we're gonna put the stock in a minute and uh let me see how we're doing with the osoboko here friends now this is a uh this was a this was a much more um popular dish years ago because it was not that expensive today you get a you order and also book in a restaurant italian restaurant it's going to cost you an hour late actually everything costs an hour i'm going to like these days have you noticed that holy mackerel i haven't seen anything like it you know i i've never seen the food the prices of food as expensive as it is these days it's really and absolutely unbelievable so as much as we want to caramelize the onion we don't want to caramelize them too much because it's going to brace for a long time so as long as i got a little color in here i'm comfortable and i don't want it to be too brown but however i'm going to wait a little bit longer because i want a little more color than that i want a little more color in this so also we're going to put some beef stock in here uh i use my beef stock you guys have the recipe for that i gave you the recipe already for that it's beautiful if you can't buy the b if you can't make this you don't have time to make it you can uh buy a beef broth one then makes you happy or you can even use chicken broth some people use chicken broth for this okay i was gonna say you could also use vegetable broth but not really if you're doing uh a venos a book or you're not a vegan okay otherwise you would use a vegetable stock nothing wrong with that my vegetable stock is beautiful okay look we got some color on this onion not exactly as much as i would like it uh so it may wait if you wait a couple of more seconds you know um i'll tell you what we're going to do because i really i hate to put something up because the minute i stop putting my carrots and my salary and it i'm done caramelizing my onion okay i don't need to caramelize the carrots or anything so let me see how we're doing over here okay we're starting to have some nice color you see but folks it's going to take a little while okay i'm going to do this side with the other side i'm going to roll it all the way around see exactly what i want right here see how beautiful that is that's what i'm looking for okay so here's what i'm going to do friends i'm going to do this on the other side i'm going to do it all the way around it and and then i come back when we finish and we put everything up together okay so give me a couple of minutes i'm gonna put just a little bit more oil in my pan just a little bit right there and um and i'm gonna continue doing that whole thing all the way around it so and and then and then we'll come back and finish this up okay so give me two minutes i'll be right back well those things are big holy mackerel okay now the onions are definitely caramelized that's what i want right there some nice color we're gonna put the garlic we're gonna put the carrots we're gonna put the celeries there you come back over here all right let me turn this up i don't need no more heat those are beautiful you see this is what we're looking for here friends beautiful color look at this gorgeous maybe that side over there oh they're big that's i could get a little more color in here all right we're done okay so now what do we got here we got um a little bit of the rosemary a little bit of thyme and then what we're going to do friends we're going to put the white wine measure carefully yeah a chardonnay is good for this a established is good for it yeah whatever whatever wine makes you happy whatever wine you're willing to drink with a sauvignon blanc really works great for this got a little citrusy to it it works perfect for this okay you remember we're going to put some oh look at this gorgeous absolutely gorgeous see this is what i'm looking for right there gorgeous color now we're ready for those so whenever you're cooking with wine friends what do you got to do you got to bring the boil and you got to let it reduce you got to get rid of some of the alcohol you got to do a reduction unless you're using pork madeira masala those are fortified wine those two don't need to reduce really simple stuff you know cooking is not that difficult friends everybody makes it much more difficult than what it is you know what it takes to it takes understanding the why why are we doing this what's the purpose of it uh salts hey how are you doing over there just want to make sure this is gorgeous i don't want to put them in there yet because i got stuff to do in here yet so i'm waiting for a thing to wind the reduce uh onion salt yeah under onion so garlic salt is great also but buy a good garlic salt butter garlic salt and it's really only salt and garlic not a bunch of chemicals in there because they put a lot of stuff in there we got a white we got to wait for this wine to come to boil and let it reduce while i'm waiting you know i tell you what i'm going to do i don't want him in a fight ben anymore let down we're done with this ripe end let's take it out of here i don't like to put it directly on my counter so here we go we're finished i didn't want it to get any more brown than this this is beautiful so we want to bring it to boil remember you got to reduce the wine by half it's really that simple after you reduce the wine then you can put all the rest of the ingredients your stock your tomatoes your whatever it is you're gonna put in here the reason why you don't put it in before because let's say i put the tomato and i said oh i got wine i got a lot of reduce it don't work that way it don't work that way you gotta wine reduction has to be done by itself you cannot put anything on top of the wine because if you put broth on top of it if you put tomato on top of it you're not going to get a wine reduction it's very difficult for the alcohol to escape if there is other products mixed in with the wine that's why it's called a wine reduction okay so whenever you use wine remember any wine i don't care what it is unless it's pulled madeira masala you let it reduce by half at least to get all the alcohol out the other wine a fortified wine and they don't need to be reduced it's really that simple okay and they sweeter though remember they're going to bring a little element of sweetness to it okay so it's very important to remember that so we'll bring that to boil we'll let it reduce a few more minutes and then i'll be back in a few minutes okay friends well the wine is almost finished reducing i'm going to take those tomatoes and i'm going to do it the way my mom does it i'm going to break them up with my hands you know it's um some chefs said oh we should be cutting them you can cut them with a knife but they have a first of all you're gonna have a huge mess on your cutting board you have to drain the juice first right that's number one and and number two is not the same i think it's kind of it's got some magic to uh when you're making a tomato sauce you're making a tomato product when the tomatoes are like roughly cut and also it gives you an opportunity in case there is a i don't know what you call it the thing or the tomato you know the um i forgot the name of it it doesn't matter this i like to remove them whatever it's called it's on top of the tomatoes and sometimes i forget my english folks the core the tomatoes the core is that what it's called the core ah they're not telling me all right so look guys uh the root the root now it's more like the corn the roots maybe it's the root i don't know uh look guys we got the uh the the tomatoes we got the tomato puree and then we're going to put the stock now uh my stock it's got tomato in there and you're going to say there's too much tomato you know what that's the way i like to make it you make it however you like to make it that's the way i like to make it i like a lot of tomatoes in my osoboko so and i'm going to put a little bit of pork wine that's going to give us a little sweetness right just a little sweetness and then we're going to put the stock just a little bit of stock i got uh you don't want to put too much stock but you still want to put enough so then you'll be able to submerge them at least uh three-quarter of the way you see so now one quick little thing for those of you that i've never seen in the channel before this is gonna be quite liquid you see if we want to thicken it a little bit we can put a little bit of flour in there okay but if we're gonna put flour on it we're gonna do it now my friends we can't do it later because if we do it later then the flour doesn't have time to cook so we put it now so what we do we take a we take a little strainer just a little strainer we don't need a big strainer let me find one negative the illustrator i'm making a mess out of this kitchen today and then we take a little um a flower we're gonna put just a little bit i just want to show you for those of you that are new to the channel welcome this is how we incorporate it okay you put a strainer in there friends you take a little bit of a flour don't put a lot because you don't need a lot just a little bit and this right there friends is going to change the texture without making it too thick you see and then incorporate flour you'll never taste the flour trust me this thing is going to cook for an hour and a half let it thick like this it may cook for two hours and a half at least because they're so thick so you see right there we got a little bit of flour that has been added where's my wooden spoon here it is here we go you see so now we're a little thicker and these guys i don't want it to be too thick but i want it just a little thicker than what it was you see and just like this maybe just a touch more stock all right i'm going to put a little more salt a little more pepper you know i want to put that coarse pepper that's a little coarse pepper in here like that reduce the heat down and right there right there i don't care what it is you braise in this liquid my friend it's going to be delicious i don't care if you're putting a brisket in here i don't think if you're putting a pot roast in there it's going to be delicious and here we have it my friends right there right there right there right there right there right there and this you know what i forgot is a bay leaf and i'm not sure where my bay leaves are oh here they are i'm going to put a bay leave in there friends i got to put a bay leaf in there because i think you know it's amazing you wonder what what does a bay leaf do do they really taste like anything you know um this is probably uh one of those uh most underrated uh flavor smells like nothing you think it doesn't do anything but it's like a journal sequoia this is like a a flavor then the bay leaves gives you then it's kind of magical it's in the background if you don't put it in there you're going to miss it not really but it's kind of a magical it's an after after test effect it's an umani flavor this is in the background and it's quite special and uh you should try to put it in there put a cover on that my friends we're going to pop this in the oven at about 375 maybe in an hour from now we'll check it we flip it on the other side maybe in 45 minutes from now check it put on the other side and then we're going to let it cook until the meats basically fall off the bone and it's so nice and tender and it should be able to pull on it it's quite amazing put it in the oven at 375. 350 375. guys put a cover on it all right now if you don't want to put any everything up on the stove but it's labor intensive you got to constantly manipulate it make sure it doesn't stick constantly do things with it all right be back when it's ready okay friends well those i told you gonna take a long time that took two and a half hours a long time i'll tell you i'm so hungry oh i forgot my right here we go so here we go friends i'm gonna take him out oh man this is hot two and a half hours it could take you depends the size of it i mean it's taking as little as an hour and a half depends the size of it those are like uh huge and here we have it friends smells amazing in here i wish you could be here this is like amazing so well the other thing i got to do right now is i got to put the olives just to get them warm i said i don't need to cook the olives you don't need to put the olives ahead there's no reason to cook them you know because um let me get a spoon here we go uh yeah so the only thing we can do at this point is check it to see if it's thin enough thick enough you know it's uh see it's thin enough it's perfect for me you want a little thicker then you got to put some little cornstarch in there you can put a little cornstarch diluting in water a little bit right see the vegetables are down and uh so at this point this is that this is ready to be served friends this is a this is delicious i'll tell you it's delicious so what i'm going to do is say oh i made a uh i made a uh egg a polenta great whatever with a whatever you want to call it if we're doing italian meal if we're doing an italian meal then it's a um uh it's a polenta if we're doing a a an american meal it's a great uh people call a different you know same thing by the way i got a recipe right there when i did the shrimp and glitz i don't know if you guys saw it but it's a phenomenal recipe you gotta check it out friends it really is so look this is a wet server okay server however you want it but this is the way i like to serve it now this is a this is a serving and a half my friends everything is so hot and then what i do you can put a little bit of parsley on top like this for uh for fun but then i like to put just a little bit on my plate again right so then i'm going to take a um this is a big serving probably can make two serving right there you know it probably could make two servings look at this thing look a beautiful day yeah that definitely mamma mia this is gonna be big let me tell you this definitely could make two serving right what do you think oh yeah look at this look at this oh yeah i was i was gonna say let's make sure we do a nice serving and no oh no of course not i got to make a mess over there right i always figure out a way to make a mess now here go friends this is where we are nice we're going to a little more um uh parsley to make a pretty and then we'll do the zest of the lemon that's another thing you don't need to cook friends you put it at the last minute right and and remember no don't be going like all them ding dongs out there doing this right this is how you do it you put the tool i know i know a lot of you are going to say okay we know we know that we watched your video before but a lot of people are new to the channel they don't know this is how you use the tool you see you do it like this right and then you go like this you see put a little lemon on it let me tell you something folks that lemon is going to do so much for your dish you are not going to believe it and then what you do remember it's got rosemary in there so you take a little thing of rosemary a little thing or two maybe because this is not a like a wimpy word put it right there and when you're serving friends don't forget don't forget you uh you want to give him a little fork or a little spoon to go inside and get the get them inside the marrow but yeah that's an amazing fact i'm gonna let it rest just for a second then i'm gonna take a bite i want to show you the inside okay okay you know i love a lot of sauce a lot of sauce so i like to put a little extra sauce on it when i'm ready to eat it let me tell you as much as i love a beautiful rosoboko the polenta the polenta in there so let's see what we got here see see look look look look friends i mean i

zoilz3mfSlA.json;i love sea bass no no you don't get i really love sea bass and i've eaten it a bunch of different ways but i've never had the opportunity to sit and think what's the best way to cook this so that it tastes the best until today of course i want to try to figure out what's the most amazing cooking procedure that makes the best sebas that's the goal and i want to make this an even playing field so i'm comparing apples to apples but i also want to take it to the next level so i'm not going to serve it up with a simple sauce no i'm gonna do it mediterranean salad you know all that goodness the tomatoes the roasted bell peppers the herbs all that the olives yes all of that we're gonna make it really quick though okay let's start by prepping it we wanna thinly slice up one shallot slice off the end slice it in half remove the outside peel and then thinly slice or julienne it set it to the side in a bowl next i have three garlic cloves and i still can't find my dain garlic press so give them a smash and then finely mince them set them to the side in a different bowl and now i have 10 each kalamata and frescatrano olives we're just going to slice them in half now i have two roasted red bell peppers i'm slicing them in half because they're a little bit big and then i'm going to julienne them from there set them to the side and now i have 15 or you could use 20 cherry tomatoes simply going to slice those in half as well last but not least i have one pound of baby potatoes golden yukons and reds now it's time to cook we're going to take those potatoes over to a large frying pan add in three tablespoons of olive oil turn the heat to high once it smokes we're going to add those potatoes in there we're just going to give them a quick toss cook it for maybe only two to three minutes remember these potatoes are small they're gonna cook quick now let's add in the shallots give them a toss for another minute you can start to see they're golden brown at this point now we're gonna add in our finely minced garlic followed up by adding in our olives next are roasted red bell peppers and then of course last but not least our tomatoes we're going to saute this together for about two minutes we're about medium high heat at this point and now what i'm gonna do is deglaze with a half cup of white wine this is going to add a lot of flavor here mix all of those ingredients together cook for a further one to two minutes then we want to season it well with salt and fresh cracked black pepper give it a stir until everything is combined and then once we're ready to serve it we're gonna finish it with two tablespoons of fresh chopped basil we're just gonna set this to the side and don't worry it's gonna stay warm this is a nice hearty base it will hold because the sea bass is gonna cook really really quickly speaking of sea bass i have two pounds of fresh skin on chilean sea bass chilean sea bass is buttery melt in your mouth slightly sweet firm fish that goes great with so many different things now in order to prep it up there are some bones that run straight through now some sites say you can use tweezers and pull them right out now they're way too big what i recommend doing is simply cutting around they run straight through the middle so slice on one side you can feel them with your fingers on the other side as well and then with the other side just slice it off yes you will lose some of the meat but that's just the cost of eating sea bass and just in case you missed it we're gonna keep the skin on there it's gonna help keep shape also help make sure it's moist and tender i definitely recommend doing it when i think of sea bass i have to go back to the year 2000 in culinary school we used to serve up dinner at the school restaurant called nicole i don't remember who came up with the dish but it was sea bass with a simple for blanc and then something called a blueberry guest streak which is really just like a sweet blueberry sauce so you get this nice lemony taste from the blanc and that sweet from the blueberry it was incredible i will never forget that as long as i live i think that's where my love for sea bass started okay now for the cooking methods here's the first one we are gonna grill this to perfection but what we first need to do is pat it dry on both sides very well with paper towels you must do this because seafood always likes to stick to things especially a hot grill at this point we're going to add on two tablespoons of oil then use some tongs i want to coat it around make sure it is completely coated in that oil we're going to season it well on both sides with salt and with fresh cracked black pepper yes even the side with the skin now we're going outside to a grill it is very hot in between 500 and 600 degrees fahrenheit it's gonna take in between four and five minutes per side for this to cook a good way to know when it's ready to flip if you can't pull it away from the grill it needs more time it's still sticking so after that time that five to six minute period give it a flip got some nice grill marks still intact perfect at the end i'm just gonna brush it with a little bit of unsalted butter add a little bit of fat and flavor to this and then at this point we're just gonna remove it to the grill we let it rest for one to two minutes before serving it up now it's looking good got some nice grill marks on there okay here's the next one pan searing is definitely art when it comes to cooking fish be sure to pat it dry just like in the last one season it on both sides with salt and pepper we're going over to a large saute or frying pan we're going to add in two tablespoons of oil turn the heat to high once it begins to lightly smoke we are gonna add our fish skin side up right to the center immediately turn the heat down to medium medium-high somewhere in between there add in one teaspoon of unsalted butter it's going to add fat help brown it up and help release it from the pan what i like to do after a minute or two is move it around all over the pan just like in my steakhole poi video to ensure that every square centimeter is completely golden brown after about five to six minutes we're gonna give it a quick flip yep perfect golden brown that's exactly what i was looking for and we're gonna cook it on the other side for five to six minutes this looks perfect we're gonna take it off and let it rest for one to two minutes before serving okay we are on to the last one be sure that oven is preheated to 450 degrees fahrenheit we are gonna bake this sea bass and just like in the first one we need to pat dry well on both sides we're gonna pour on two tablespoons of oil make sure it's completely coated and of course season both sides with salt and pepper however this one is going into a small saute pan if you have a non-stick pan great skin side down we're going to add on one tablespoon of melted unsalted butter i want to keep the playing field as even as possible going to the oven at 450 degrees fahrenheit it's going to take in between 12 and 15 minutes once it begins to break up i usually know that it's done this looks awesome you're going to put all of those fundamental techniques into practice with these three procedures now that everything's done let's quickly plate this up i'm just gonna divide that delicious mediterranean base that we made in between three different plates and then we're gonna add on our grilled sea bass our pan seared and then last but not least our baked sea bass and seriously every single one of these looks absolutely delicious it smells ridiculous in here so i'm not gonna waste any more time we're gonna start off with the grilled sea bass sea bass just melts in your mouth get a hint of smokiness from the grill and that little sear mark that char mark really adds a lot of flavor that's really really good i want to try some of this base too regardless you definitely need to make that that's super good goes really really well with that sea bass okay now we're gonna try the pan sear oh man so buttery so delicious right now this is the favorite i'm not sure if it's the butter we put in the pan that crispness on the outside it's moist it's tender that one's a winner so far let's get to the bait falls apart dang i mean that one is super moist it doesn't have that nice sear on the outside but it's tender i'm guessing the oven that keeps a lot of moisture in there that's really good all right you know the rules decision time this is a tough one i'm gonna go with the pan sear i think that crispness on the outside that nice brown sear mark just takes it to the next level second place baked last place grilled sorry grill sorry barbecue fans out there pan sears where it's at today and i'm telling you right now you have got to check out my best way to eat halibut honestly this sea bass would work perfectly in all of those halibut recipes i'll see you there;['segundos']
Z_HfXrSOlsE.json;well hello there friends amazing steak dinner tonight caramela's Dono and cheese on top of a New York strip oh amazing remember thumbs up you like the video subscribe to the channel

other one I'm gonna put a blue cheese you can do it however you wanna and we make a sauce with a beautiful mushroom sauce friends let's get going now in the pan I'm checking my heat because I want to make sure that I'm hot I want to make sure I'm hot I'm gonna put avocado oil because you know avocado oil has a higher smoke point and uh and it's kind of like flavorless you don't taste avocado don't think it's gonna avocado if you don't have a good vegetable oil friends you want to use um a clarified butter don't use regular butter you scarf my body otherwise a regular bottle is going to burn you know really really quick we're gonna make the sauce for this we want butter we're on regular butter I'm gonna make a nice sauce you'll see very simple friends now the steak friends I already got the salt going on over there I already got the salt I did it 24 hours ago if you have the time do that if not you got to put the salt in as much as you can in advance if you remember this is all in our steak video if you haven't seen the stack video how to cook the perfect steak I recommend you check it out friends it's phenomenal we're going to make a little mushroom sauce in here I got a little shout out going on let's check it to make sure I got the right heat on the steak so like I said I put the salt uh 24 hours ago if you don't have 24 hours if you have a few hours wait put it on the rack don't put the salt don't put the um the salt directly on the uh the steak and don't cover it when you put it in the fridge okay it's got salt already what I gotta do is put pepper that's all I got to do and I like to use a nice crotch crushed black pepper okay so you have a nice presence of pepper put as much as little as you want just make sure let it um it's very important to do salt in advance because it allows us to have a nice dry crust it's very important to dry crust once so we're going to take the steak right now my temperature on my oil is about 350 degrees right now so I'm gonna put it in and at this point I don't care what anybody tells you friends don't touch it leave it alone leave it alone we're gonna make a we're going to create a Maya reaction Maya reaction and Maya reaction is a beautiful cost and uh and we're going to do it on one side beautiful beautiful crust and then when we have that question we're going to flip it on the other side and we're going to continue the whole thing all right friends while the steak is doing is staying so remember check out that video it's worth it for friends okay this is the mushroom sauce okay I got portobello mushroom and I got regular mushroom then I slice thin I got him in Charlotte anyway we're gonna put a little Mushroom in there and as we know as we know they don't know I'm telling you uh mushroom got water in there you're full of water and you know what I think of water nothing I think nothing of water because I I don't like water in my food because water tastes like nothing it really does I mean really think about it right what if there's like nothing so I want it out of there I rather replace it with wine with stock with broth with anything but no water in my food please I mean sometimes I use it you know for baking and making stock you got to use the mixed stock right um otherwise I don't like to use it no in the food a lot of people said they don't like mushrooms because they don't like the mushroom they don't like the texture remember the texture is the conductor of flavor don't forget that texture is the conductor of flavor I talk about that a lot because I want to make sure you all get it it's really important my friends to for you to understand then the right texture conducts the right flavor so if you have a mushroom then test have you ever had a look have you ever had a um a canned mushroom don't do it when you have a cane mushroom we have nightmare for three weeks the the consistency of it it's like you chew on it an explosion of type of water so you don't want that's why you don't want it because it's about texture but in my mushroom you know how many times in my restaurant people will say you know what I like that sauce but no mushroom please I said you know what I tell you what you'll have my sauce the way I make it with a mushroom and if you don't like the sauce I give you the new sauce okay I'm game I I don't want to say I'm betting 100 here but I would say 9 out of 10 people would say you know I don't like mushroom but I like you mushrooms just because they got the water in there they were testing good all right so look what what can I do to help me uh if you look at them right now they got no color they got no collar right we're gonna take a little bit of salt I'm using a porcini mushroom salt that's because I got it you know mushroom sauce your soul just use a regular salt don't worry about it it'll be perfectly fine okay so let's check it don't touch it though look If It Moves by itself you see without me peeling it that means it's ready the protein and release themselves now we can flip it oh it's getting good it needs a little few more minutes okay so now look look what I did friends I saw I poached some carrots carrots they're beautiful look at this you buy them today they get them carrots right there you put them on a stem you know they're very fresh the stems is beautiful and green and all I'm going to do is very simple right put a little bit of olive oil in there very simple I'm gonna put some chopped parsley in there nothing nothing complicated a little bit of salt and pepper a little bit of salt and pepper earlier on the carrots that's all I need little salt and pepper look and I'm gonna pop them in the oven with the steaks all right let's check this let's see what I got oh look at it look at this look at this one now if that's not a beautiful crust I don't know what that is they're gonna go in the oven five minutes that's it in the oven five minutes friends while they go in the oven five minutes I'm gonna finish the sauce right there I'm gonna put the carrots in the oven so I don't forget them because they're cooked already remember the carrots everything is going to be happy in the oven and now all I'm gonna do Oh Mamma Mia I forgot to put the onion on the steak sometime I forget things let me not do that let me not forget this is let me just stuck my diamond I forgot to put the onion on the steak the onions if you don't have those I totally get it again we made a video on this trust me my friends you make them you put them in advance you keep them in the freezer if you haven't ever made harmonize it's with it you see what I do friends I put them nice on top [Music] just like this beautiful then I'm gonna put some cheese on it I want to show you you can put a beautiful piece of brick look I got triple cream brie cheese friends look at this ah it's sticking I had cut the slice but it's giving me a lot of technical issues I cut it in advance you got to cut it when it's cold and then it just married with the other piece nice thin I'm using a triple cream Brie look at this and then you can also do if you don't want to put debris you can put a beautiful blue cheese put a gonzola cheese with a Rockefeller put whatever you want friends you don't put the you know like the golden soda or you don't like the blue cheese then go with the brie cheese you don't want to cheese don't put the cheese all right now we're going to cut down the thyme obviously because they don't need to go back in there another five minutes I'd say another three minutes will be enough three and a half four minutes okay I'll repair this all right now let me continue over there friends let me get going I gotta get everything back in gear now I think we're good I always forget something oh I wanted to tell you about the onion friends there's so much to tell you sometimes see I make him I put him in a little container like this see look like this and I freeze them they stay in the freezer for 17 years you make a tomato you put them on top of fish you put them on top of anything they're amazing they're really our friends okay potatoes Jack is going crazy now because I got the camera going everywhere I got a little bit of olive oil I got a little bit of olive oil now I'm going to put a little bit of garlic I'm gonna put a little bit of time and a little bit of Rosemary that's going to be the flavor of the day little time little Rosemary I'm gonna get this hot then the potatoes friends I already cooked the potatoes see I use the nouvelle potatoes I cut them in decent pizza slice and I purchased them in boiling water so they're cooked all I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna reheat them in here okay that's all I'm gonna do really simple they cooked now I want you to see the mushroom friends if you could be here right now to smell them you will not believe it smells amazing and you see and look look at the color look at the color you remember it was no color before we got a push this we got to get a little more color they've lost all of their volume look at the potatoes very simple you take them get in there yo they cooked remember putting them all the volume fresh herbs in there a little bit of chopped parsley look at this a child could do this the secret friends the secret is to get everything ready in advance this is a kind of video by the way friends that you can make you know you can you can do with me prepare everything in advance after the whole thing set up go wind back the video the way I'm gonna put some cheese in there the way the the um the my kitchen was set up and you can do it in advance let's finish the sauce friends we're gonna put a touch of balsamic vinegar now remember my Buddhism vinegar is an age balsamic vinegar it's age 18 years old so 18 years so it's it's soft and sweet if you don't have an 18 year old balsamic vinegar don't put a regular balsamic vinegar in there because it'll be too harsh on you I'm gonna put a bit of Masala wine just a little bit of Masala wine it's a dry Masala wine because my vinegar is sweet now if you have a young balsamic vinegar you probably can still make that sauce but then you want to make it with a sweet sweet and sour they got to balance each other all right so we're gonna put a little bit of stock a little bit of stock in there friends I got a beef stock look how beautiful that beef stock is for it's look how gorgeous studies and believe it or not we're done how are we doing on the steak another one minutes I'm doing good I'm doing good the reason why I'm doing good friends first

first take an intern another thing friends look at this look at look at those potatoes they're gorgeous sometimes I'm coming back here more often the food is delicious on the sauce friends you don't have to do this but I'm telling you try Bree oh blue cheese today I'm putting blue cheese all right Gorgonzola cheese or Rutherford whatever one you want as long as it's good quality don't be buying that cheap stuff at the grocery store for some of them are really cheap no good Mama me that means the timer that means I gotta go good move oh that was a good see that was a very good move friends we're gonna check it oh yeah oh yeah friends we're gonna put a little bit of parsley in here oh look at this so we got one with a blue cheese and and one with a Brie the potatoes all I gotta do now friends is check on the um and the carrots and we're ready to eat so now look the sauce is good friends but you notice it's a little liquid it's a little liquid right so now I could put a little cornstarch diluted in water or if I had made a rule in advance like we did on the video right there and then you have it you can always take a little bit of cuckoo and you can put it in here it's already cooked you put it in there you make it you keep it in your kitchen it's a room temperature you can use it as you need it and voila friends and this sauce right there friends you can rub it all over your body we're going to put a little bit of fresh thyme a little bit of Rosemary at the last minute right put a little salt in there put a bit of pepper I'm gonna have a lot of pepper on the

this try and get one and you can also if you don't have garlic powder you can use garlic fresh garlic and i also have with me here one like four cloves of garlic more garlic as you had a finger of ginger and one tablespoon of tomato paste and some lime because you know fish loves like fish and some touch filling is just on another level and for the coating of the fish this is a fillet and here with me is two tablespoons of all-purpose flour and we're just going to add some spices from here and coat the fish fillet and just fry them on the pan that's it so it can be crunchy and then cut your corner flavor to come choose a sour so let's begin with a cooking action i'll start by patch drying this fish fillet that's why i have my paper towel here i'm just going to cut it dry with the paper towel and now i want to just slice it into four pieces [Music] and there i have it so i'm just going to flavor up my flour and coat them to my all-purpose flour i'm going to add some paprika some garlic powder i'm just using the spices that i'm going to use in the choozy because i don't want to to bite into a very all-purpose flour without flavor that is some curry powder and here i have some freshly grounded black pepper some salt to taste casey two then we're going to mix this i know i'm using a joke but it's cute it's cute there goes my flour and even before i pat my i dip my face and patch it right again i want to make sure it's dry you can see by the imagination [Music] foreign [Music] oh my god i thought they were boneless this person should be checked then i have my second

_cgtAw21MM4.json;well hello there friends perfectly cooked prime rib i'm gonna show you exactly how to do it the only way to really cook a prime rib remember thumbs up if you like the video subscribe to the channel and don't forget to ring that bell stay tuned we're gonna start right now well hello there friends let me show you how easy it is actually to cook a prime rib we're going to do it the most simple way everybody can do this i promise you we're going to do reverse c the technique is very simple sounds fancy but nothing fancy about cooking anyway it means we're going to seal it at the end instead of at the beginning so then we will have an even medium red ray all the way from one end to the next without having that gray sear line that we normally get and when you do a big piece of meat like that you need to do it this way it's really the only way to do it very simple what do we do first salt and pepper uh on the in on the outside everywhere rub salt and pepper put it in the fridge for about 24 hours if you have it if you don't have 24 hours at least three four hours please three four hours at least minimum 24 hours it allows the salt to penetrate dries out the surface creates even a better crust and now it's sold all the way through it's like a dry brine how do you buy a primary buy the one with the most marble you can find normally prime it is but prime is very difficult to get these these days matter of fact i went to three stall try to get a prime primary i couldn't get one so i got a nice choice prime will have a lot more marbling than this nice this is beautiful but prime is better if you can get it okay you want to also get it from the chuck end from the check end if you notice this is this side is a little smaller than this side right there the chuck end is much more tender much more flavorful okay so that's all we need to do salt and pepper put it in the fridge the next morning if you have time what else do we do not much i like to brush a little bit of clarified butter if you don't have clarified butter then brush a little bit of um uh avocado oil just a little bit because what i'm going to do is i'm going to brush a little bit of the provence on it on it i'm going to sprinkle a little bit of the provence and that'll make the hebrew province stay nice and not dry out so much you can't use fresh herb for this no no fresh air friends if you use fresh herb then they're gonna they're gonna burn completely makes no sense at all if you want to use a little bit of herbs you don't certainly don't have to help the provence you see i have him because remember i'm from provence so they say whenever you do a big roast first you really really have to do the reverse series there's no other way around to cook a um a big roast it doesn't matter if it's a prime rib or not a roast you gotta do the reverse here so then you have an even cook all the way around it you see beautiful right there let me dry my hands and now we're gonna do one more thing this is very simple i got my oven set at 250 degrees friends 250. yeah we're gonna cook it very slowly and this is a this is a seven pound with a bone i got three bones right here this is seven pound this is going to take three three and a half hours the secret is not really the time i mean it's important is the temperature we want to cook it to 120 remember i like my meat rare medium rare medium rare rare so if you're liking more cooked you'll cook it longer but we're going to cook it 220 degrees we're going to take it out of the oven when it's 120 degrees and we're going to let it rest 45 minutes to an hour we're going to let it rest when it's resting the juice will be redistributing and then we'll put it in the oven a good 10 minutes or 500 degrees to create a beautiful crust and i'll show you how to do that okay so believe it or not folks we're going to use a thermometer if you don't have a thermometer it's time to get one okay this i love that's the one i use for the turkey remember for the turkey we use that so i'm going to put it inside and it's going to warm me when it gets close to 120 i'm going to put my alarm at 116. okay we're going to go right in in the chuck end and we're going to go right there right in the middle of it and we're going to try to stay in the middle so i got to be about around here somewhere so let's look to see pick up the same hole and don't worry about losing the juices you got a lot of people said oh mama i'm going to lose the juice no you don't you'll see when i take it up this is this hole is going to be dry no juice is going to come out of there all right so we're going to put this in the fridge at 100 and we're going to get to 120 the oven is 250 degrees really simple my friends nothing special look put it in the oven get your thermometer wire out of there this is really a simple technique my friends get the thermometer right there plug it in it is the alarm is set up it's 250 degrees the alarm is set up to give it to me to give it to me to warn me when it's 117 degrees so i got a few minutes to set up to make sure i'm comfortable that's all there is to it folks put it in there when it did you see how beautiful it is when we cut it so i'll be back in about three and a half four hours for you it'll just be a few seconds and uh we're gonna cut we're gonna no we're gonna finish it first before we cut it all right so we'll be back as soon as it goes well hello there friends three and a half hours three hours and 45 minutes to be exact we have 120 internal temperature 120 so we're gonna unplug it check it out we're going to take our probe out so we know then we have the right temperature now i know 120 is not exactly cooked and that's okay that's okay some people like it very very rare we're gonna let this guy rest beautifully like this we're gonna let it rest for about um 45 minutes half hour 45 minutes just cover up you know i hate aluminum foil but it's not really touching it it's just keeping it warm a little bit and the beauty of it now all of the juices from the outside inside are going to slightly travel through a little bit of the outside so we won't have any of overcooked edges at all it's going to be nice and moist from the inside out beautiful but we're gonna let it rest and when we're ready to eat that's a beautiful thing you can finish all your vegetables and everything and when you're ready to eat turn the oven up at 500 degrees i'm gonna put some butter in there and then i'm gonna put it back in the oven just to get a beautiful golden brown so we get this beautiful color that's all we're gonna do so we'll be back in about 45 minutes after we give it time to rest because when we cut it we're not going to lose any juices all right so we'll be back in about 45 minutes well hello there friend 45 minutes went by nice and relaxed so i'm just going to put a little butter on there i just sew a little bit of extra fat right there i'm just going to remove it to make it look pretty that's all that's all there is nothing esther can do with it we're not going to touch anything the butcher removed a little too much fat for me but that's okay i'm just going to pour a little bit of soft butter in there friends and it's still warm so it's going to be very easy to just apply it everywhere you see i got myself a brush in case i needed to but i don't think i'm going to need it and now what we're going to do the oven is going to be a 500 so the butter is just going to get golden brown and we don't want the butter to be too soft because we want it to stay on long enough to get golden brown you see and um you certainly don't need to put the butter some people add mustard and things it's up to you really i i like you know i love butter what i'm gonna tell you i love butter at this point you could put a little more of the provence if you want to but certainly don't need to this is good right there and we're just gonna pop it in the oven the oven very important 500 friends and um 500 degrees and that's all we're gonna do we're just gonna pour it in here even the dish is uh is warm it's not uh not hot gonna go right in there and give it to me right there and we're gonna put a timer for 10 10 15 minutes now if you like it more cooked than that don't take it out at 120 take it out of 125 130 and then do the same thing and then it'll cook 135 140 but that's like getting to the medium medium well so be careful how you want to like how you want to cook if you want to reheat it it's going to be very well done if you don't have a cookie sheet with a rock like i do do it on a roasting pan and then a roasting pan just put leeks carrot celery and onion just put it on there and then you can use those vegetables to make your own but we made a no shoe we got the video on there and and also the horseradish sauces they if they're not released they're going to be released in the next couple of days so you'll have both of them in the sauces all right we're going to come back in 10 minutes when it's beautiful golden brown and we're going to cut it all right we'll be back in a few minutes all right friends 10 minutes 15 at the most okay 10 minutes here it is look at this look at this friends i don't know if you can hear but let me tell you who look a beauty look at this beauty look at this beauty it's wonderful let me turn this off let me turn it off so i don't forget because i always forget now at this point the beautiful thing about doing it the way we're doing it friends we do not need to let it rest it already rested this is just to get it nice and hot so let's take it out of there let me grab something so i don't have to put my hands on it because it's quite hot at this point and right there my friends what we're going to do is we're going to take it out okay so here we have it now at this point you could also get away with some of that extra fat right there then which a lot of it is a butter and deglaze that to put in your ojoo if you didn't make the old shoe the way i showed you how to make this i got a beautiful recipe on that so now friends we're going to take it out and it's very simple all we got to do now is we got to take the bone out because unless you want to give somebody a a uh two pound pieces you want to take the bone out it's a lot easier so to take the bone out my friends what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the knife and we're going to rub it against the bone so we're going to go right there we're going to cut the knife is on the bone all i'm doing friends i'm following the bone really really simple whoop we grab it with a towel yeah i didn't go out with very good we grab it with the top because it's quite hot and i'm following the bone friends and that's all i'm doing and i got caught right there and right there there you go all right we're following the bone so now we'll take it out now it's not much meat on the bone but a lot of people like to chew on the bone friends they like to chew on that bone and uh so the meat on the bone is quite tender at this point okay so we'll take it out and now we're going to cut into it all right so this is a little rare in a bone but it always is like that but you know remember i like it rare medium rare so this is how we're gonna get it we're gonna go in there right there and we're gonna cut this to show

_MvR8X64XBc.json;[Music] my big question is can i cook a fish supper using six ingredients in under five minutes well we're going to do this with one camera take no cheating five minutes on the clock let's click start right we are good to go five minutes lemon salt straight from the fridge you want to use lemon soul here because not only is this soul man yay but we are also going to get quick cooking fish and it's going to be delicious to make up this sort of salmonella which is a classic sort of french way of preparing salt we're going to add some salt and pepper to some flour season up that flour with a good generous bit of pepper essentially this is going to be the coating for this fish so you do want to be quite generous with us now give it a good pinch of salt and actually before i get cracking we need to get our pan on nice and hot with any of these recipes it is all about getting the pan really nice and hot so look we've got lovely bit of flour seasoned up and ready to go just give that a good mix through and make sure that it's evenly combined at this point looking good okay give it a little shake soul is with the skin on you want to keep the skin on it's lovely and it's great flavor and it's also going to give you a lovely crispy back to it so just coat it quite nicely in your flour give the hands a quick wash into that hot pan we're going to go in there with some butter few knobs of butter going straight into that pan we're also going to hit it with a touch of oil and the reason i'm doing that is just to make sure that it doesn't burn the butter doesn't burn now while that's melting down i need to check my time we are four just under four minutes looking good looking good give that butter a nice melt down this is why you need your pan on nice and hot very quickly and now that's melted down just grab up your fish shake off any of that excess flour and just pop it into the pan coating it in all that gorgeous butter look at that right get rid of the flour you don't need that anymore we are looking good hands getting a quick wash again essentially this someone yay is with a little bit of a difference i'm not using capers and you can use them if you want to but we are going to do this as a full meal so we have some lentils and some asparagus and i have a great little tip for quick cooking your asparagus just take a veggie speed peeler like this and take the end of the stock and just take off nice little slivers of that asparagus there is a tiny bit of waste but you know what this is quick cooking and we just have to crack on so take up your asparagus spears your fish is getting a gorgeous color i just want to make sure that we don't burn it i'm going to turn it down at this point slightly keep going with those asparagus spears really quick cooking veggies if you didn't want to do asparagus spoons you could use oh what would you use you could use some spinach some baby spinach would be perfect in here but you're only doing this for one person so nice little slivers of asparagus is exactly what we're after here and the speed peeler like this will just make life a little bit quicker and a little bit easier i love the fact that with a recipe like this it literally takes minutes and fish people forget this but fish is one of those things that just cooks super super quick so just shave up that asparagus we want to you know usualize the fact that we fish that cooks quick and use a vegetable that cooks really quick too so this is looking pretty good you can eat these no bother stick them in your garden be grand give that a nice shave and those peelings are now going to get put in alongside the fish but first we do need to turn it so at this point we should have a bit of a golden color on the fish which we do it's looking gorgeous turn up that heat we are now at one minute and 41 seconds i think we're going to make it but we just have to keep cracking through the asparagus asparagus goes in and around the fish here you want to get it just coated in those little bits of butter and just get them nicely tossed through they should soften down ever so slightly and while it softens down we're just going to clear down so asparagus is gone we've got all the excess the beauty of this five-minute meal is just how quickly it comes together the rest of the ingredients we're gonna need are a little bit of lemon juice some butter and we've got some lentils as well six ingredients fish asparagus butter lentils a little touch of flour it's all looking good little squeeze of lemon juice goes into the pan while we're cooking off the fish we're gonna get that fish which is now beautifully cooked out of the pan smells so so gorgeous right now make sure you get all the asparagus out there as well get that right there we're going to whack in a tiny touch more of that butter and get it melted down and we've got 44 seconds to go lads it's not looking good to finish this up but i'll keep going we have that fish beautifully cooked we have our lemon ready to go feeling the pressure a little bit with 30 seconds to go i'm hoping that brown butter will brown up let me turn up the heat okay this is looking good seasoned up bit of salt bit of pepper tiny touch and a squeeze of lemon juice once it goes nice and brown it's starting to get there come in and have a look at this because this is where the action is this is where the flavor is i've got 18 seconds okay gonna squeeze it with that touch of lemon juice make sure to get no pips in there give it a good sizzle this is looking good we're going to utilize this to make a gorgeous sauce we've got five seconds to go quick plate it up we've got those gorgeous lentils now with these lentils you can serve them cold or you can serve them hot we're going to get them straight on the pan i'm out of time i'm out of time i didn't make it quite but you know what we are nearly there we're going to serve this up when you've gone to the effort you want to make sure that you serve this up beautifully so grab up that gorgeous soul fill it stick them on the side get some of those gorgeous asparagus spears give it a nice little toss through little lemon wedge on the side gorgeous where all the action is brown butter and my friends that is a fish supper in just over five minutes [Music] you;['segundos']
