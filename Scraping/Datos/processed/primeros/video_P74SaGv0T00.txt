hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today start of the show simple and delicious Scotch eggs these beautiful little protein bundles of goodness have been around for hundreds of years debatable on where they originated from but for sure they're an old British classic I love them I'm gonna give you different options on seasonings and coatings let's put these together so my water is just beginning to boil I'm going to gently put in my eggs you want to maintain just a gentle boil throat but boils too hard it made crack the eggs with it bouncing around and after 5 minutes we'll take those out and put them into a pot of water and ice to quickly cool them down well you what if you don't love me please don't pretend you do the eggs have cooled down and they've been peeled now I'm using a spicy Italian sausage this is a fairly small to a medium sized sausage it's about 3 and 1/2 ounces I'll cut the casing off these and one of these just happen to work perfectly per egg now you have some options you can buy pork ground pork seasoned it the way you like Italian seasonings whatever ones that you prefer maybe just some salt and pepper I have also used ground turkey and it's fabulous if you're looking for a lower fat the ground turkey just loves to be absorbed by flavors and I added a curry to it it was outstanding so there's a couple of options and ground beef as well so I'll start removing the meat from our casing once you've sliced down the casing the meat is easily removed [Music] like so so let's begin to wrap the egg as I mentioned I have about three and a half ounces of pork sausage here we're gonna roll this up just like we're gonna make a burger patty use a plate flatten it out put a quarter inch thick peel that off not to worry if it tears a little bit you can fix up with your fingers and we'll drop our egg in it and begin to roll it up it just takes a few minutes and stands together take your time and there it is I'll finish these up and then we'll get to our coding so let's start coding our eggs we need an egg well beaten with a half a teaspoon of water some flour and some bread crumbs I'll be using Italian bread crumbs you can use regular bread crumbs plank is a good option so first into the egg wash nicely covered and into the flour after the flower one more time in egg wash [Music] after the egg wash into the breadcrumbs coat him well and then just kind of gently pack them right into the meat lightly greased pan so during the coating one of my egg yolks broke but I'm not wasting it simply all I did was put it in an oven safe Bowl we'll put it alongside we're not wasting that 375 30 to 35 minutes and we're gonna roll them halfway through let's get him in the oven [Music] they're gonna be terrific please don't pretend [Music] thank you we got lots coming up so stick around everyone well I hope you enjoyed that recipe Scotch eggs are so versatile they travel well take them on a picnic take them biking take them to lunch you can also warm them up and they're great with many different sauces they're good with gravy they're good with a ranch dressing they're good with a Korean mayonnaise dressing goes on and on get creative make it your own I've put together a little yogurt and fresh dill together ketchup even works marinara sauce well listen if you enjoyed this recipe give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my videos you'll get notified every Monday when I put out a new one now I'm gonna try the goods they're so tender no sauce [Music] Wow so tender and moist a little crunch on the outside that dill sauce works well I think you're going to enjoy these thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see [Music] [Applause]
