we loved getting the appetizers from you guys I got several dips so I thought it would be fun to do an entire video just dedicated to the dips I'm gonna be starting off with a crock pot one this one right here was actually submitted by a family member Monica has been married to her husband John Michael for 18 years they have two beautiful girls they Adventure in their RV they go out to really fun places a couple of years ago Monica and John Michael bought the dream property and built the dream house and I'm not it's not even like a massive house it's nothing crazy like that but when I say it's the dream house I mean we ask them for their house plans like it is ideal the setup is so gorgeous but Monica is the one that reminded me of this recipe right here and my husband is gonna be so excited because this one is his favorite probably tasted this one before and you may have even made it it is so easy we're making a smaller version so I will have the full recipe Linked In the description box foreign ahead and browned up some sausage so we've got sausage here in a pan I just went to the butcher at the grocery store and just asked for a quarter pound because we just didn't need to make a full pound of sausage we don't need a full thing of cream cheese if I were making the full recipe I would add that in goodness that is stuck normally it comes out in a easier to easier get to get out of the package what am I trying to say normally it's easier to get out of the package okay so I'm just gonna do I'm gonna do about half of this y'all if you didn't see my last subscriber appetizer video I was all over the place there were so many bloopers and this one kind of feels like it's gonna be that way it's all going into the crock pot insert I have another recipe that requires cream cheese so I'm just gonna set this to the side and to that you're going to want to add something like Rotel this is the version of Rotel that I got at Whole Foods it's the same basic thing so if you um you can also just add tomatoes and the little canned green chilies you can absolutely do that too so I'm gonna do about half of the can and then we like Rotel a lot in different things so I'll just reserve the other half and it'll go in another recipe okay so my husband's actually at work today because they're having a Christmas party normally you guys know he works from home but he's gonna come home and be so excited about this okay so you can see here I'm not even like really mixing it together it's gonna go just like this into the crock pot now this is a very small crock pot just wait this is my husband's crock pot from college so when we do something that just requires a small crock pot this is the one that we use my husband was a basketball player in college so everything was basketball so but it's very convenient when you need to make small things so I'm just gonna set this to the side we are going to turn this on high but if you're gonna cook it all day long I suggest cooking this on low so we'll come back in a little bit and Stir It Up I think this is best served with tortilla chips we do have some blue corn tortilla chips left over from the last video I did so that's probably what we'll serve it with but I've got some other little things that I think could be good with this too little bread crusty bread so we've got a couple options here foreign this next recipe came from Janie Marie I believe I don't have any other information about her she left me a comment and I haven't heard back but Janie Marie submitted this and it sounds so easy let me tell you what she said but I have a super good no cook appetizer first of all no cook that's really easy you take an eight ounce block of room temperature cream cheese spread it onto the center of a plate or medium sized platter pour a bottle of cocktail sauce in the center of the cream cheese and spread it over not going over the side of the cream cheese that's interesting place crab meat all over the cocktail sauce you can buy a can of crab meat where they sell tuna fish in your grocery store sprinkle three diced up green onions over the top and serve with club crackers place the crackers all around your dip on your plate or platter it's always a huge hit at my Christmas parties so we are going to make a version of Janie Marie's appetizer here I'm using this leftover cream cheese I'm gonna do this on a platter and kind of see how we can make it look we'll see how this goes so I'm gonna take this cream cheese and we're just gonna plop it here in the center of it's it's mostly room temperature it's probably a little harder than room temperature but I think we can work with it so we're just gonna kind of spread it a little bit I don't think it has to be perfect I mean have you guys seen the cheat uh what the like butter boards where basically it's just all these different kinds of butters on like it's like the new charcuterie board I guess but this it's similar to this kind of concept you're just spreading it around and then um adding the stuff to it I think this is just really neat a really cool concept mine may not be as pretty as Jamie's because I'm not 100 sure how she does it I actually made up of my own cocktail sauce you guys this was so easy to make and yes if I were making a bigger recipe I could have easily gone and just bought this at the grocery store but I knew I only needed a little bit because we're making smaller versions of all of these this was so easy it's ketchup lemon juice prepared horseradish and Worcestershire so incredibly easy to make okay so we are going to let me just give this a little mix again and I'm just gonna do like a kind of a Sprinkle drip kind of attempt to kind of drizzle over the top deal Janie is this right I think it looks cool it's gonna look cool okay she said not to go over the edges I'm sure that it's gonna get all over the place when we end up dipping the cracker in anyway though okay that's maybe she does more than that but that's all of the cocktail sauce that I'm gonna put on there I got some crab meat from our like the seafood section in our grocery store and this one was on sale this was actually at the second grocery store I went at the first grocery store this was 26 dollars I was like that's an expensive appetizer when I went to the second grocery store it was actually on sale for 9.99 that's a lot better plus I'm gonna use some for this appetizer and then a lot of you talked about some different crab appetizers to go with my leftover wontons from the last video If you haven't seen it I'll have it linked here so you can see it but I thought that's perfect I need crab for that anyway so I'm gonna open this and let's just add some to the top [Music] now I got the claw says wild caught claw claw crab meat this appetizer is right up my alley [Music] okay this is really fun I want to try it now but I feel like I need to wait for my husband to try it because you guys just really like it better when the both of us do taste test together we set this to the side just for a minute and let's chop up some green onion now I'm assuming she uses majority green Parts because I think it's mostly probably for looks now let's add some of that green onion to the top [Music] don't tell I'm gonna try it that's good okay that's really tasty and so simple I I am pleasantly surprised by this one now I don't have club crackers but I picked these up at Whole Foods today they're just already made up little um crusty bread crostini so I'm just gonna that's loud I'm just gonna add these and then it'll be ready to go this is awesome [Music] you guys I absolutely did not intend this but it almost kind of looks like a little crab with the toast on the side like this which makes it really cute by the way this one is an everything bagel cheese ball and the stuff in this it sounds delicious okay this one was submitted by the Alias is Texas Stardust she said I was previously married to a chef and I did a lot of experimental recipes even an almost flourless chocolate cake long before it was a thing the year was 1993 and she was making it for his birthday so she said she loves this one served with Crispy bagel chips or Cracker assortment or pretzels and she said it's so easy no cooking you can make several smaller ones which if you've seen this video right here I did make several small cheese balls and it's so neat the way that it's served I'm gonna make one cheese ball for this one just for the purpose of this video but I love making them mini cheese ball size as well you guys know I've been making smaller versions so she said she uses one package of softened cream cheese I'm gonna use the half of the package always feel like you can cut recipes in half and a quarter you can triple them double them whatever you need according to the size part you're serving I did not realize that my cabinet was open the whole time I was filming that okay we need a little less than a tablespoon of prepared horseradish so I'm adding that in we do need to chop up some green pepper or scallion do whichever you would like and [Music] [Music] let's just start to combine this a bit we need some cheddar cheese to go in this and of course bacon always you guys know we usually have it prepped and ready to go I actually just prepped it today so it is right here ready to be added so we're just crumbling it up into little pieces and I'm adding about two pieces or so but I had cut mine in half so they're smaller already now we mix all of this together and then we will put it inside of some plastic wrap to form that ball shape I'm like really gonna love this one it's just all the ingredients that I love we're going to just take this and put it here in the center and then this will help us like form that ball shape the cheese ball foreign for at least an hour and then we'll finish this one up okay so I'm gonna pop this in the refrigerator and then move on to another one my little cheese ball has actually been in the fridge for a couple of hours let's finish this off and I think I'm Gonna Roll it in a bowl so I've got some of this everything bagel seasoning Trader Joe's sells this Walmart sells this they're all over the place now I've seen it at Aldi okay so I'm just gonna put some in here and let's just plop this in roll this around we're just going to make sure we get some of this seasoning all over it so she said she uses like a half cup I don't think we needed that much because I did a smaller version the dish that I wanted to make this next one in is has just grown legs it's gone so we're gonna make it a mess this one sounds like a recipe that I almost grew up with because whenever we make chili we do free what we call Frito mess and it kind of seems like a play on Frito mess okay so this is from Alicia Alicia says that she has a son a grandson and a granddaughter she loves to cook she said she's actually won several cooking competitions and she's been cooking since she was eight years old so this one sounds really really easy I don't even know what we want to call this it sounds delicious though okay so we are going to take some of this cream cheese so I've got a half of a block left okay so we're just going to put that here in the center I am going to spread it just a little bit okay I don't know if she does this but this is kind of like my take on it [Music] all right and I just made up a super quick chili she said that she uses pour a can of chili over it now I already had all the stuff a lot of the ingredients were being used in dinner tonight so I went ahead and just made up a super little quick chili here we're gonna throw this over the top it already smells delicious okay now I definitely think that a no bean chili you guys know this is a debate on my channel whenever I make chili I actually love beans in our chili I know that's not Texas Chili but I do think that for this recipe it's better to have no beans but that's just you listen you make any recipe however you want to make it you know that is a motto here on my channel I'm just going to use all of it even though that's kind of a lot of chili I think it'll be okay okay she said she tops this with cheese and then she bakes it in the oven I don't know how long or what temperature I'm gonna go 350 and we're just gonna bake it until the cheese is nice and melty foreign [Music] cheese I'm actually using a pepper jack because I already had it shredded you can use whatever you want to use you guys know that as soon as my oven is preheated this is going to go into my preheated oven and we'll we'll start at like 10 minutes and see how it looks but I think if as long as it doesn't spread too much chips around the edge here could actually be really pretty this recipe is a goat cheese dip super simple I mean crazy simple this was submitted by narissa and she says I'm in love with goat cheese lately so a really easy one is goat cheese baked with marinara sauce then use some garlic naan or crusty bread to dip if you want to be if you want it to be sweet you could switch the marinara out for some apricot jam nerissa says I live in northern Michigan so winter is frigid and long I have a wonderful husband and an amazing eight-year-old son named Marsh we also have three yellow labs who love to clean the floors when I cook and make messes with food I have a tethered spinal cord along with some other issues so I'm unable to work it this time she loves to cook and bake for her family and she can tell that I do as well it feels like I'm cooking with a friend when I watch your channel I love that you guys I love that okay so let's try this recipe I've got some goat cheese here oh and it needs to get used it's actually expiring in like three days so this is perfect timing now this bowl is oven safe so I'm kind of hoping that I can just do everything here in this bowl we'll see how it goes I mean this is crazy simple okay I've got a marinara that I just made up really quick you guys know I prefer to make ours up but you can do it however you want to do it and I'm just going to Top This goat cheese with the marinara that's it I mean and oh oh I have some non-bread so I will end up toasting that up so actually let's cut that into triangle pieces and toast it up I don't know if she spreads the goat cheese out but we're gonna try it just like this I feel like it needs something green okay I know this isn't ideal but my parsley did not look good the fresh parsley so I'm just gonna add some um dried parsley and actually that looks really pretty so I like that we have this naan bread I'm just gonna go ahead and cut it into triangles and then we will toast it up on a baking sheet in the oven but we all really like naan bread so this is great you could add a garlic butter to this if you wanted to um I mean you know you can buy garlic naan bread already if you want we'll just do a quick toast on these once the oven is preheated and ready to go and I haven't had lunch yet so I made up the Crusty pita bread it just went in the oven for about 10 minutes or so let me just put some of them in here make it look a little prettier this recipe might be the easiest one that was submitted but I had to pick it just for the stuff that came with it okay hey there I'm Jenna I'm 35 years old and I'm from Lansing Michigan I'm a bonus mom to my boyfriend's three wonderful children and I'm also a full-time manager of three salons so I'm very busy all the time but I'm Italian and I really love to cook and bake it's therapeutic for me and I really enjoy making food and goodies for my family I was at my friend's holiday gathering everyone had already eaten the actual meal but of course you're always hungry for things later we were chatting in the kitchen and the host pulls out a hand mixer salsa and cream cheese and sets it out she says it looks disgusting and too easy to taste but I tried it fell in love and I've brought it to pretty much anything I've ever been invited to since it's always a crowd pleaser everyone loves it and it's constantly requested I like to put mine in the fridge for a couple of hours or overnight for a thicker consistency but it's awesome immediately as well she also says P.S tell your husband I know exactly what Fazoli's is we still have one left on the south side of Lansing and it was my favorite place to eat growing up so if you missed it in the last video where my husband and I were cooking together we had a conversation about Fazoli's and so there was lots of conversation on that one I am cutting this one down she said she uses two blocks of cream cheese we just don't need that much so I'm cutting it down I'm I have about six ounces here in this leftover in this container I'm gonna put mine in my KitchenAid mixer because then I can focus on other things while that's mixing up so she said she just mixes it up for a couple of minutes and then it's good to go so this is 14 ounces I need about eight or so ounces of salsa you could use whatever kind of salsa you like [Music] all right let's try it this is just the salsa mixed with cream cheese so simple but I mean I don't think it looks disgusting she said in the in the notes that it looked disgusting I don't think it looks disgusting which it was in like a big dish you wouldn't gravitate toward it true is there Cholula in there no there needs to be it's really good yeah I got mild salsa and I do feel like if we had done a medium or a hot we would like this even more these are two flavors that I already love so mixing them together that's it's kind of a given for me can is there another appetizer like that exists that takes 30 seconds to make I mean if you have somebody coming over and you need something to throw together how often do you not have salsa and cream cheese in your house this is perfect foreign do you know what's in this my sausage dip it is your sausage awesome told you guys he would be excited for that one all right so let's Stir It Up a little bit just a little portion but I know you're gonna eat the whole thing so now I'm regretting having that crumble cookie at the end of the work day okay so we're going to eat it we're going to try it with these little mini toasts that I got at Whole Foods it's gonna be hot it's too much too much what these this has to be with chips okay so we're not going to eat them with the toast we're gonna eat them with chips there's more in that bag too like it's just what do you mean too much the ratio it's too much of that too much bread oh because you like this so much yeah this is probably my favorite dip if I ever see it at a party or anything that's the one he's going for yeah all right so with chips not with the toast because the toast is overpowering yeah well no not overpowering but that toast should not be an item it's like if you have two huge thick pieces of bread on a peanut butter and jelly and you can't taste any peanut butter or any jelly because the bread is just overwhelming we already know that we like this one we're just trying it for yourself yeah okay thank you Monica [Music] we have the everything bagel cheese ball there's horseradish in this oh nice which I thought was really interesting then we have a little thing that we can oh yeah we do a cool little thing so everything bagel I like the addition of the horseradish it's good I'm not a huge fan of cheese balls to begin with I love cheese balls but for a cheese ball it's good I do like that horseradish aftertaste it just adds this other element of flavor so as opposed to just getting that cream cheese cheese and bacon there's something else there that you're like oh that was interesting I I actually really really like that one I would consider adding horseradish to any cheese ball because of that so this one is the goat cheese with marinara I had a spinach and goat cheese Empanada today at Cantina 1511 for a vendor luncheon and it was good yeah if you have a Cantina 1511 that's that's excellent it's so good she said she's been a fan of goat cheese a lot lately but if you just put some marinara over it and bake it it's really good I think I think that I could have put more marinara on it though because there's a lot of goat cheese there yeah but it's it's similar to that the pizza deck pizza dip yeah but the pizza dip is with cream cheese right I think so but you could sub cream cheese if you're not a fan of goat cheese you absolutely could do cream she's here yeah I like this more because it feels lighter than the cream cheese yeah to me but I like it I like the flavor of it I think the kids are really gonna like that one yeah and I mean it took minutes it really was you guys saw goat cheese and then marinara if you're using jar marinara it's even faster than what I did okay so this one is it's cream cheese chili and cheese and she said it's best served with Fritos we don't have any Fritos obviously it would be perfect yeah what's in the chili just my normal jelly except no beans I didn't know beans you can put a glob of sour cream on the top that is so good that's the money appetizer right there it doesn't need the sour cream now now that you've tried it do you still feel like it agreed that's really good that is really good this is delicious oh my goodness okay we this is gonna be a winner I think for everybody for sure yeah I can't think of anything else I do other than just Cholula but that's yeah what I do for most things no yeah but all these flavors work together together perfectly if you had the big Fritos the scoops that would be ideal what's this person's backstory Alicia is her name oh she says to top it with chopped tomatoes and green onions too so Alicia didn't give me much information about like where she's from and stuff this is delicious it's very good this is cream cheese cocktail sauce crab meat and green onion I like this one because of the uniqueness of it yeah I like the flavors together like cocktail sauce hits you first I mean we have more crab in the fridge I feel like I wasn't generous enough with the crab on this one that's what I was gonna say you guys know I was trying to hold back because I want to do something else with it before we tasted it together and I really liked the way that everything works here he our son gives it a thumbs up this has been sitting in the fridge for a little while like a couple of hours actually while I was making everything else and my husband thinks that it would actually be better if we let it set out for a few minutes and just come to room temperature and I totally agree and I actually think it may have said that in the instructions that she used uh room temperature cream cheese oh thank you so much to everybody who submitted your recipes I'm going to be doing another one of these in January and I already have it planned it's going to be with another type of food so stay tuned I cannot wait because I think that this one's gonna be really good and I'm making a mess like usual wool so I'm going to now we're gonna add something [Music] what are you doing I know you guys are gonna love these as much as we did if you need more inspiration for appetizers check out the video above [Music]
