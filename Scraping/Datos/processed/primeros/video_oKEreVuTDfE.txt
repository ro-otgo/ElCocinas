[Music] that's good it's really good [Music] hello friends and welcome back to my kitchen so today we are going to make some easy and delicious biscuit dough recipes i actually saw a recipe over on instagram using biscuit dough and i was like wow that looks incredible so i wanted to make that one and then that got me started like looking at different recipes using biscuit dough and there were so many good ones so i was like let's just do an entire video only using biscuit dough and honestly there are just so many variations of things that you can make with this one ingredient and whether it's like for breakfast an appetizer or like a full-blown meal or dinner there's so many great recipes so if you have one leave me a comment down below and tell me what it is i would love to try it but without further ado let's go ahead and get cooking okay so the ingredients for this first one of course you're gonna need the biscuit dough you're also gonna need some string cheese i bet you can see where this is going and then we're gonna melt a little bit of butter add some garlic you can add like um parsley or basil kind of whatever you have on hand and i'm also to add a little bit of italian seasoning to that as well we'll brush it on top of our like cheesy biscuit bombs and then you can actually dip these into marinara once they're done y'all mr b is going to love these okay so first thing i'm going to do is go ahead and preheat my oven to 425 and then next i'm going to take each individual biscuit and just kind of roll it out until it's flattened okay and one more tip i actually got the flaky layer biscuits so like this one i just kind of pulled apart that way there's not too much bread to cheese consistency if you want to leave the biscuit just as is you can but i think it'll be better kind of a little bit thinner biscuit consistency [Music] okay so now that we have our biscuits prepared i'm gonna go ahead and take our string cheese and i'll probably be able to cut this into like three or four pieces and then we'll just put three little bite size pieces in the center of each biscuit [Music] but now we're just going to take our biscuit dough and kind of bring it up over top of that cheese and form like a cheesy little biscuit balm keep all that goodness inside there just like that [Music] okay if you've watched the past couple videos i'm gonna let y'all like laugh with me because we still have not gone to get a microwave we ended up going and staying at the camper this weekend at ocean lakes for like funky's birthday and valentine's day like a little weekend getaway but that means we did not go get a new microwave and i was like hang on i can't just throw this butter in here to melt it and then earlier today bunkie was trying to make lunch and he couldn't heat up his lunch and i was like oh my gosh we have seriously got to go get one so i'm going first thing tomorrow to do that i'm just going to throw it in a little saucepan on the stovetop melted that way and then we can throw our other ingredients in there i'm gonna do just one kind of little crack of salt over these two because i think that'll be really good and then these are going to go into the oven for just about 15 minutes okay i present to you some goodness that you're gonna love and i gotta tell you something hilarious oh that's a nice herb herbie okay listen babe i was gonna um heat you up some marinara to like dip them in we don't have a microwave but then listen the struggle is real but then i was gonna just put it in my little sauce pan where i melted the butter i realized we have no marinara so just envision in order to taste test this properly you have to hold one and pull it apart okay so get whichever one you want look at this one here okay and then you gotta just pull apart oh bonkey look oh wow you're not as excited about the cheesy pool as i am oh no well [Music] that's good it's really good mm-hmm that little topping you got on there it's magic was expecting a lot of biscuity taste here right very very much not biscuity you know why because these were like the flaky layered biscuits and so i pulled them in half so it's like less yes that was going to be a suggestion i was going to make yeah genius right yeah but if i had some dipping sauce with these two and we were hang on these are like almost like those um cheesy bites we're gonna battle their night at mellow mushroom yeah but actually there's a thousand times better we can get a direction these are like um i mean it's almost like garlic knots with what's mozzarella stuffed yeah you know and they're so simple it took 15 minutes ma'am i sent you a text message a little bit ago i haven't seen it did you get it no i i recommended bucky if you were feeling a little bit crazy uh-huh you could add some pepperonis in here for me oh for sure yeah that would be like a great little lunch or an appetizer i know so i thought of something else okay are you ready yeah because these are made with biscuits uh-huh i thought of a name for them oh tell me are you ready i'm ready now this was that only after i thought about the pepperoni okay addition of pepperoni but you can put pretty much any ingredients oh yeah that's for sure southern pizza poppers bonky boom this is what i'm talking about that's a great name right yeah i don't know what kind of this is incredible these are so good back there you know sometimes i gotta try one let me give it let me tell you this i think it's the garlic is that fresh garlic you chopped no it's all the jar oh well anyway it's really good mmm those are so good wow okay this is absolutely delicious i'll have to try them so simple finger looking good okay friends i'm gonna meet y'all back in the kitchen tomorrow morning because we're gonna make a little breakfast casserole using the biscuit dough and y'all know i'm like the biggest breakfast fan ever so i'm so excited for that and then after breakfast we have one more recipe

for up to 16 free meals and three surprise gifts okay good morning i got my coffee i am so excited for this breakfast i have my stuff laid out here behind me but i want to tell you guys i was actually editing this video earlier this morning and i realized that my camera something happened i don't know whenever i pulled those little cheesy bombs what if i could call them southern pizza bombs i don't know out of the oven yesterday um so i don't have that footage but i wanted to say once you pull them out you're going to take the remaining of your like buttery herb goodness and brush them again y'all they were delicious like one of our favorite little things we've made in a long time so y'all definitely have to try those but anyway let's go ahead and get started on this breakfast casserole okay so the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and preheat our oven to 350 degrees and then i'm gonna go ahead and fry some bacon okay so i'm kind of having this recipe so i'm only gonna use about five slices of bacon but i am gonna go ahead and kind of cut it up into bite-sized pieces since we're gonna have to chop it up and put it in the casserole anyway [Music] okay so now the hard part is not to eat all of your bacon before you make the casserole so i'm gonna put it over here and try not to eat any of it and then to my bowl i'm going to go ahead i'm going to use about five eggs because like i told you guys i'm not doing a full blown recipe this is just for bunkie and i and i'm going to whisk those together with a little bit of milk salt and pepper [Music] okay so once you have your eggs whisked you're gonna take your biscuits and then just cut them in half and then in half again so just like this and then like this so you have four little pieces of biscuit and then you can just go ahead and toss these in to your egg mixture [Music] and then also to your egg mixture you're going to add in half of your bacon and you're going to want to save the rest of it to add on top [Music] and then if you're making the full recipe go ahead and use a 9x13 baking dish since i'm kind of having it i'm just going to do like an 8x8 we're going to go ahead and spray that and then add our egg mixture into our baking dish we'll pop it into the oven at 350 degrees cooking it uncovered for 20 minutes then we're going to bring it out top it with more bacon with cheese pop it back in for 10 more minutes and then we're going to have the most scrumptious delicious bacon egg and cheese casserole like y'all i'm like drooling i cannot wait okay this is already looking so good so now we're gonna top it with more bacon and with cheese i actually only had like three slices of bacon left so i just went ahead and cooked the rest of it that way we could have like extra bacony casserole so we're gonna add that to the top and then if you ask me there is nothing better than velveeta slices because it just melts so good so i'm going to take a couple of those and just tear them apart lay them on top and then we'll pop this back in the oven for about 10 more minutes [Music] okay this is out of the oven and it looks so good but also our house smells amazing i think there's nothing better than bacon in the morning so i'm gonna go ahead and get some for this guy so we can taste test this also the recipe that i'm going off of basically she was saying that she feels like this is like a deconstructed mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese biscuit oh so see that's why i'm so excited because i love a mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese yeah they they have probably one of my number one bacon egg and cheese biscuits the same hold on you know i gotta smell it we know we know how does it smell i mean i don't know if i would have thought this unless you said it but it really does kind of smell like a mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese biscuit you know what i think makes it more like that is the um velveeta cheese that's exactly what it is [Music] my goodness you're right bucky i'm being serious you're being serious it pretty much tastes kind of like a deconstructed bacon egg and cheese biscuit which that's what it is i know but usually you don't love breakfast but you think it's really good because that's a very simple recipe and y'all this would be great for like thanksgiving or christmas morning or just like an easy weekend breakfast recipe for your family this will be a nice uh weekend breakfast for the family i agree yeah because it i mean i don't know it was so simple it looks like you've like quartered up some biscuits and dropped in some eggs and cheese and bacon yeah so simple yeah that's good okay yay seriously though and it's hard to get a breakfast winner out of me you know trust me i know so now i'm gonna go make me a plate have some get ready for the day and then i'll meet you guys back in here and we'll make our third recipe okay so i did not end up making that recipe yesterday so it is the next day bunkie and i are still in our pajamas we have not gotten ready for the day we're having a very slow morning it's very nice and i have saved i feel like the best recipe for last shut up this is going to go down as like i feel one of the best canned biscuit dough recipes we're making blueberry monkey bread with biscuit dough wow it's going to be crazy good so let's get started we're going to start by getting our biscuit dough we're going to cut it into quarters you're going to need some flour some sugar butter cinnamon and then of course the star of the show some blueberry pie filling no mr b at least you know that hamburger joe's is coming your way later wow that was a big old pop that was a good pop i am so excited for joe's should we just like pick one regular biscuit or do you need the whole thing we can bake one regular biscuit probably okay let me give you the trash thank you okay clean kitchen is a happy kitchen so crazy okay let me get this brightness down because you all know how it is in here okay now you got your biscuits we're just gonna cut them like i told you guys into quarters heavens the betsy the lighting situation is crazy and our dishwasher still doesn't work so i'm using the butter knife to do this because that's all that's clean i wish i could laugh at that but it's not even funny i don't find it hard we have to get a new dishwasher okay well i finished these me you go ahead and get our flour and sugar in your bowl quarter cup of each quarter cup of each and then we're gonna add butter and cinnamon to that as well you got it yeah i was i was exaggerating the difficulty there okay i'm gonna give you the camera and you do you the recipe says like half a teaspoon of cinnamon i want to add just a pinch more than that and that's not even worth measuring so i'm just gonna oh yeah wait no okay let me do it i don't want to do the thing what thing [Music] cinnamon is serious business funky tell you what i'll give you a a rounded half teaspoon okay slightly rounded throw her in there now oh my goodness monkey if you don't push it in there i want to know i'm playing okay now this next part is for softened butter but of course you know we don't have the microwave and we didn't set it out long enough so what i did was i took the two tablespoons and i cut them up i went ahead and like helped us out here so we're going to throw this in and then kind of like mix this together until it's nice and crumbly and then we're going to put it in a ziploc bag and toss our biscuits in there [Music] okay bunkie has mixed this into absolute perfection that's a beautiful topping and you know what it looks like what it really does [Music] okay biscuits are in and then give this a good shake until all the biscuits are coated with our sugar mixture okay so to a medium saucepan you're going to add four tablespoons of butter which is like half a stick and then also your blueberry pie filling we're going to stir this until it just starts to simmer [Music] okay so now back to that same bowl we're going to toss our biscuits back in here and then b is going to pour our blueberry pie filling on our biscuits and we're going to give that a good stir [Music] okay so once you have all of this incorporated you're just going to add it to a bundt pan i went ahead and greased this one really well and then we're gonna pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes [Music] oh and one more thing we are going to put this on a baking sheet to put it in the oven that way there's just no spillage or nothing boils over okay so while our monkey bread finishes up in the oven which all by the way looks already so good we're gonna go ahead and make our little like cream cheese frosting that we're going to drizzle on top now we are not going to actually use cream cheese we're going to use this mascarpone if you have cream cheese use that we just want to try this because i think it's going to be really good and then the recipe calls for half and half or milk we just happen to have milk and not half and half so that's what we're gonna use you're also gonna need powdered sugar and then a little bit of lemon juice and we're just gonna mix this all together [Music] now if you use cream cheese you're probably going to need a handheld mixer or if you don't have a big strong guy for sure but monkey's going to use his manpower and stir this by hand or so he thinks and yes he didn't just take a shower looking so fresh you know what i was slapping about a minute ago what i don't know where i come up with this stuff but you know on a wheel of fortune yeah how there's the game called before and after yeah this is before and after what is you taking a shower yes oh my goodness you are crazy don't focus on my jiggle here okay look at it you see it don't look at it oh this is mixing together perfect i need to add a little bit more uh powdered sugar oh for sure because you all know i didn't measure i just eyeballed all this oh that's like perfect consistency because you want to be a little drizzly oh yeah that's what we're looking for okay since it's just me and you eating this i'm going to eat it right off the spoon okay [Music] it's really good does it need more sugar or it's perfect no it's great oh i'm so excited we have like five more minutes left holy smokes that's like liquid cream cheese sugar yes which is amazing like i'll just drink it please you know what it almost tastes like what that good milk after you've had some cereal oh yes that's the best the big reveal oh boy wow i'm really having a hard time not just like diving into this okay we're gonna let it cool yeah for like five or ten minutes then we'll pop it onto our serving platter and drizzle our icing you know what'll really get you what when you try and eat pie that is too hot because that pie filling will burn your mouth you're right you have a squirt tongue and there's in the roof okay we're going to pop this bad boy out will you do the plate part what do you mean oh you're on top this may be a little premature but we cannot wait any longer all right oh this is gonna be just you you okay what i'm coming over there oh okay you be prepared okay just in case you have to grab something okay i have my one hand ready oh boy okay you like it like released i do not but we're gonna let it uh maybe let gravity do its thing for a second okay it's critical to kneel yes when you do the flip yes stuff for sure ah i'm kidding oh it did what's it look oh my goodness monkey only one little part wow this looks so good i am so proud of this it's either cold in our house or that's really hot that's really hot i mean do y'all see this the separation very easily separating very nice and truly this was so simple to make wow i'm going in okay oh my gosh i love how we always sing but we love food we're always like melting out crazy things [Music] well that was worth all of the effort that went into this which was very minimal but the outcome very desirable is it amazing oh
