y'all I am pumped because we are in the kitchen today whipping up some yummy holiday appetizers you all know that is like my love language and someone actually told me on Instagram they said I think you are the queen of appetizers and I was like that is a title I am so proud to claim so anyway we're gonna get started on this first one we're making some Big Mac bites y'all they are gonna be so easy and so so good so let's get started okay so first thing we're gonna do is get our hamburger meat cooked and of course we'll turn off the grease I'm gonna season mine with some of the Blends because you know salt pepper and garlic what better to put on a burger I'm gonna get this cooked to drain it and then we'll start assembling yo I'm over here laughing at myself because you know how I always forget an ingredient at the grocery store and today I was like I did so good I feel like I got everything well of course to make these Big Mac bites you have to have like Big Mac sauce so in my brain I'm thinking like ketchup mayonnaise pickle like vinegar I can kind of like you know even I never made it I kind of just assumed all the ingredients well apparently I should have looked up the recipe because you're supposed to use like French dressing sweet pickle relish like all the other stuff that I do not have so we're gonna wing it and make my version of Big Mac sauce okay if this turns out good I will try and like leave my little recipe down below for y'all I'm gonna start with some mayo I feel like that's a good amount and then we'll add some ketchup I could have sworn it was mayo and ketchup I had no idea the French dressing okay that looks good let me go ahead and give us a stir see what the color is because I think the color is going to kind of tell us if it's the right amount or not okay that's looking good we're gonna add a just like white vinegar okay that's good I'm going to grate a little bit of like white onion in there we're also going to add like a pinch of sugar and then I'm going to like cut up this spear into tiny tiny tiny pieces We'll add a little bit of that in there too we're gonna make this our own okay pickle and I just tried to like dice it really small okay I'm just gonna use my little microplane to try and Grate this onion in here hopefully this is gonna work so yeah that's perfect [Music] y'all my eyes are watering oh my goodness I'm gonna have to walk away I'm over here in tears oh I can't handle it okay y'all what is the hack that will make you like not cry when you cut an onion I feel like there's some sort of hack I just can't think of it is it a wet paper towel sitting beside you or something like that if you know it tell me in the comments we're gonna add a little crack of salt and then a pinch of sugar I feel like that's probably good um and that's it I'm gonna get Bunkie to taste this and tell me if it even remotely tastes like Big Mac sauce okay so I thought that I had all the ingredients to make Big Mac sauce because I thought it was like a whole other recipe uh-huh but we didn't so I want you to taste that and tell me does it come close is it good does it need something else well it looks like the right color that's what I was going for so we're off to a good start okay smells about right did you know that Big Mac sauce also made of like French dressing oh me either but every recipe I look at it says that are you sure yes okay taste it that seems that seems spot on you're kidding no okay good I mean now it's been a while since I've had a Big Mac but that tastes right it is good yeah that's very good actually oh okay good that makes me excited I'm excited I cannot wait to eat this it's gonna be so good while you're down here will you um drain our grease off please yes okay so how we are going to make these little bites is we are going to make pinwheels out of crescent roll dough now I know that I could just get the dough sheet but I already have these on hand so I'm gonna use what I have so I'm going to open these up and then pinch all of my seams together so that virtually I have just like the crescent roll dough sheet um but if you want to just grab the Doshi at your grocery store do that okay I'm gonna need these to stay together more than this y'all I'm gonna have to like doctor these things back together [Music] okay so now we've got our dough put back together we're going to start by adding Our Big Mac sauce first and you want to save a little bit so you have some to dip them in and then just kind of like spread all of this out [Music] then next we're going to go in with our meat [Music] now if you want to go in with like shredded sharp cheddar cheese you could I have this like Boar's Head American cheese which I think makes it taste even more like a cheeseburger and it's going to be so good on here so that's what I'm going to use and the words of monkey crust to crust is a must and now we just sprinkle our minced onion and our pickles right on top now as gently as we can without losing too many things or tearing the dough we are going to try and wrap this up just like you would do a pinwheel and I may have stuffed these a little too full these went from like Big Mac to Whopper gonna like pull this over y'all these things are huge this is huge but I am really proud of the fact that like we didn't lose anything and we got it all to like stay together okay now we're gonna cut little pinwheels out of this okay so you want to use like a really sharp knife I feel like the sharpest one that we own and then I don't want to like smush this down so I'm just going to gently cut through it that is perfection and we're going to pick up our little pinwheel make sure it's really good and cut and then we'll just lay it on our baking sheet okay can we just take a moment for the beauty of this I'm so impressed [Music] okay now let's be honest with each other here I stuffed mine way too full I probably would have been better off with a crescent dough sheet instead of you know the crescent rolls that have scenes and I probably could have used a little less cheese but here we are I barely still lost anything over here so I'm very proud of that actually they don't look that pretty right now but I think they're gonna look pretty when they come out of the oven so we're gonna pop these in the oven at 375 for like 13 to 15 minutes okay y'all I forgot one ingredient so don't put it on there we gotta sprinkle them with some sesame seeds Okay are y'all ready to see the goodness of these things oh my gosh they're bigger than your regular pinwheel but they look so good and you know what I love like all of that meat cooked like even more in there so it got like really browned which I think just gives it more flavor [Music] stuff these a little bit too full yeah so they're Whoppers instead of Big Macs but they're not pinwheel size they're like pancake size but I think that's all the better you know that's a full handheld correct serving so like instead of eating like four you can just eat one or two right like you don't gotta feel guilty about you know getting three or four on your plate you just get one Big Mac is like one of my favorite you know yeah I know fast food items I don't get it very often because I feel guilty about eating it but I like the sweetness that the crescent roll is bringing oh good to the party very very prominent pickle which one would expect the only thing that I would say is I'm I'm not getting as much cheese as I'm as I'm looking for okay this is hilarious because I feel like I put too much cheese in there but here's the deal I use that Boar's Head American Cheese Slices and I think that just almost like dissolves into the meat you know like it almost disappears I think if you use shredded sharp cheddar it would give you like more flavor I mean overall still fantastic I was gonna add one additional comment yes please do I think for the presentation you can put these on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce wow because that's what you get with a Big Mac look at you B so just in case that's hilarious and it'll also uh you know for all of us out there who like that little that little crunch that little texture yes you can grab just a little bit of that Iceberg on the side and include it yeah okay so Bunkie wants iceberg lettuce and more cheese okay now this next recipe is for me because this has my name written all over it we're gonna make like crispy loaded potato bites using tater tots like I am the most excited I saw um in the kitchen with Mama Mel she made something similar to this a while ago and I was like I have got to make that and then I was scrolling through Pinterest and I saw this recipe and I was like that reminds me of that recipe I want to make this it looks so good so very very easy you're gonna need a muffin pan and depending on the size of these you can do like a regular size or the mini muffin pan of course depending on the size is how many tater tots you're gonna put in each little hole I'm gonna go ahead and spray mine and then I'll probably do four to five tater tots in each of these [Music] I was gonna make this whole pan but it ain't that's enough for me and you [Music] I might even make a couple more now we're gonna stick these into the oven at 450 degrees so it is a hot oven We're Gonna Bake these for 10 minutes on the bottom rack then we'll pull them out and we'll smash them and then put them back in now while those are in the oven we're gonna get started on our third recipe and y'all this one is like not a lot of cooking well there's no cooking at all it's more of a simply in preparation exactly the easiest but when I when I saw this recipe it and what a great thing to take like to a little get together because you don't even have to turn the oven on so let me show you okay so for this little appetizer you're gonna need like some yummy crackers if you can find ones with like seeds or nuts or Cranberries or you know all the fun things in there pumpkin seeds perhaps even better you're also going to need some fig spread some goat cheese prosciutto now I did forget the dates I forgot to even look for the dates I don't know it's fine it's gonna be fine they're like not critical to this correct if you want to add date spell means then after we assemble all of these and by the way you could also just like fry some bacon and then just like cut the strip in half and use each half on one of these if you don't want to use prosciutto would be equally amazing um and then once we get these assembled we're going to top them with honey and flaky sea salt like they're gonna be amazing okay we have like a rather large block of this um goat cheese I'm just only gonna do like half of it and you just want to kind of get in here and start crumbling it up foreign [Music] look at that smear that's the goat cheese smear wow okay so now we're gonna take our fig spread and then just add a little bit to the top of our goat cheese this is like the good stuff right here [Music] are these are 10 minutes oh my gosh clothes out it's been 10 minutes we forgot about the tots set a timer we did not set a timer but they're looking perfect yes okay it's been a little bit more than 10 minutes it'll be fine okay so now you're gonna take like a shot glass or a mini Juice Glass whatever you have that is small and round and we are just going to smash this right in the center see how it kind of makes that little what do you call it well a little like well the next bird's nest yes thank you my mommy said probably said that because that's where all of our cheese and bacon and sour cream is going to live oh this is like Perfection oh my gosh okay now these are going back in for about 15 more minutes until they are nice and crispy once the cheese get involved after the 15 minutes okay on top or middle oh we don't know I gotta close that oven back to my pretty crackers on top of our fig spread we are going to add our prosciutto foreign last but not least we are going to just drizzle these with some honey [Music] and then top them off with the tiniest little flake of sea salt [Music] foreign [Music] that was good that's so good like the goat cheese and then the Fig yeah [Music] and then you got the nice saltiness from the pursuit and then that wonderful vessel of a little cracker so good very good was it too much fig well he said I was too heavy kid with a thick spread actually no okay good what y'all did not just see was as soon as I opened this up and eat the tater tots out our smooth detector started going off Upstairs Downstairs everywhere I'm like fan it fan it with the um towel and I look over and Bunky's just like wiping the counters down and see if nothing's happening I'm like funky the smoke detectors are off they're like piercing so low our neighbors outside like grilling and bunkies just like cleaning the counters I'm like hello I can only I can only do one thing at a time I like okay open the door it's because the oven's on 450 that's like hot so when I opened it it like made this one detector go off I'm telling you it like melted my like mascara off monkey it's not a heat detector it's a smoke detector I said smoke detector I know but you're saying that the smoke detector was going off because the oven is so hot I think it is I don't think that's right but it might be true I think it's true okay I'm trying my cracker I know I say that a lot of things are my favorite but this one is your favorite I'm I was good that's a it's a nice little pickup handheld like takes the work out of off the person you know you don't got to get a cracker you don't got to get cheese you don't gotta get prosciutto all separately y'all it's all put together for you the flavors are amazing I love fig jam and that with goat cheese is a goat cheese is like very Tangy it is it's like a Powerhouse combination and then like prosciutto like you know always that's that is the goat always prosciutto and the cracker with the crunch like that is the perfect little handheld by appetizer goodness it is so great okay now back to our word to your thoughts they are already looking so crispy so I'm gonna add a little bit of shredded cheese to the bottom of each of these and if you want to cook bacon and like add your own bacon in here you can I'm just gonna do like the real bacon pieces because we have those and it's easy [Music] all the lighting in our house for some reason is so bad but these already just look so good so they're going to go back in the oven for just like five or ten minutes and then they'll be done we'll top them with sour cream you can do chives all the things top breakfast please don't let this mic to touch your coat off again okay I need us to talk about this like fig prosciutto cracker just for one more second because I truly cannot get over it I just had two more and for something so simple I just am blown away by the flavor how amazing they are like I'm mad that I did not get more prosciutto because I could truly eat like 10 more of those if you make one thing out of this video you need to try this like I am just floored at how good they are oh and one more thing um you can also top them with fresh basil which I forgot to get yo I thought I did so good and got everything in the grocery store but apparently I forgot a lot of things but if you have fresh basil actually that would even take it over the top I think the basil would like really yeah oh [Music] okay I'm gonna let these cool for just a second before we top them with our sour cream foreign [Music] for this taste test because this is like my favorite you know I'm scared they're gonna be so hot wow I heard that crunch [Music] saw a little cheese pull um satisfaction 100. you love potato skins you are going to love these it's like potato skins but better because this is like so crispy but you still get the potato all the toppings it's handheld bite-sized like so good also you could dip these in just like ranch dressing just absolute scrumptiousness oh my goodness which is the best idea what you can make these and instead of putting like the cheese and bacon you can put a tiny little sprinkle of cheese and then taco meat oh say say goodbye to the tortilla y'all that would be so good like there's lots of ways you can make these the first thing that I love is this spiderweb of crunchy cheese yes going up the sides yes that is awesome I'm also liking how crispy these things are looking they're very crispy that 450 degree oven Tim it's important it is because it gets you a real good like exterior on these they're still soft on the inside everybody knows that I'm not much a fan of potatoes we know but one of my favorite potato forms is in that of the tot yes yes yes I do love a good taut there's you can get me with a top yes regular old potato skin I'll pass on it right french fries don't care yeah right but this here is actually pretty good okay I'm so excited these turned out really really good yeah I mean not I would dare say that this is a tie with the goat cheese prosciutto figgy cracker wow I'm gonna put that one just like a notch above these but still these are like right up there now if if we did have my green onion or scallion on here it might put them over the top of me [Music] thank you
