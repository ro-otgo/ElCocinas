[Music] hey folks welcome to in the kitchen with feet today simple and delicious recipe is an appetizer it's great to have some new appetizers we'll make her own crostini not the store-bought ones you almost break your teeth on and then we'll make a nice filling with ricotta cheese roasted garlic some sun-dried tomatoes some herb mushrooms it's gonna be delicious you're gonna love it let's get cooking nothing like making your own crostinis as I mentioned at the beginning when you buy them from the store sometimes they're so hard have you ever had that it almost feels like it's gonna break your teeth this is the way to go and then you can put the seasonings on that you like they're gonna be delicious slice the crostinis as thick as you like I like to slice them to about a half an inch to 3/4 of an inch thick now we're going to brush them with olive oil give them a flip and we'll do the same to the other side you can get creative with all your seasonings when you're making crostinis but here's what I like to do just a light dusting of salt and oregano I've got my pan at a medium to high heat they don't think long you just want to get them to a nice golden brown color just like that give them a flip we'll do the same on the other side and then we'll begin to get our ingredients prepared for all our different toppings we'll need some roasted garlic for a ricotta spread it's simple cut the top off of a head of garlic wrap it in tinfoil place it in a metal pan and give it a little drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt that's it into the oven 350 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes and when it comes out look it you just squeeze it out as much as you like slice it off with a knife and there's your beautiful roasted garlic [Music] now I'm using cremini mushrooms you could use white mushrooms actually cremini mushrooms are just a small size portobello any mushroom is like a sponge they just love to absorb flavors but don't pile them up too high in a pan lay them nice and flat or you'll create too much moisture in your pan and save the salt till the end same thing too much moisture in them if you put the salt in early and then we'll add some garlic that's fresh out of my garden [Music] we'll need some finely diced garlic just run your knife through it several times and we'll set that off to the side in a pan medium heat we'll add a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil now take your time when you're cooking mushrooms it's like cooking a fine steak you want to sear each side of them take your time don't pile them up once we've got our mushrooms to a golden brown well clear out a little spot for our garlic to go into just lay it into the pan and then we'll add a teaspoon of olive oil let that heat up for about a minute or so garlic cooks very quickly and once those flavors and aromas start coming out we can incorporate that into our mushrooms only takes about 30 seconds to get all those flavors mixed around you'll be able to smell that beautiful aroma when the mushrooms are done we'll add a pinch of salt and we'll set these off to the side and then we'll begin to get ready to put together our ricotta spread [Music] I've got all my ingredients laid out we'll need one head of roasted garlic one cup of ricotta cheese one tablespoon of Parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning one tablespoon of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of olive oil I like to use my little electric mixer it does a great job mixing together all these flavors you could alternatively put it in a bowl and mix it all up with a fork place all the ingredients into the electric mixer it only takes about 15 to 20 seconds give it a good mix you can taste it for salt at this point and then we'll set that off to the side and let's begin to build our crostinis [Music] so when you're putting your ricotta mix on lay it on as thick as you like this stuff is so good and our mushrooms Oh outstanding I think three mushrooms on each one will work out just perfect and the sun-dried tomatoes dice them up as fine as you like or put them on on whole pieces these are the sun-dried tomatoes that come in a jar packed in oil I like to put the whole piece of sun-dried tomato on now we'll lay a nice piece of fresh arugula it not only looks nice but it gives a little peppery flavor now after you put that little piece of arugula on here's the showstopper dazzle this with some balsamic glaze this stuff is so tasty it's thick like syrup let's go to it give it a nice those drizzle look at that now that finishes it off beautifully the guests will come back for more for sure now when you're done having fun drizzle in that balsamic glaze let's pretty it up with a little bit of parsley doesn't that look nice oh oh man that looks delicious well folks that was another simple and delicious recipe I hope you get to try it out with your friends and family guarantee they're gonna come
