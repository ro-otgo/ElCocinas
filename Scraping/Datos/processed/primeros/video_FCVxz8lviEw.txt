I felt and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today simple and delicious recipe is going to be an appetizer I was out of wedding recently and I notice how the people gravitate towards the chicken skewers and I've come up with this beautiful little recipe Cajun Parmesan chicken skewers you can use the same recipe and a breast of chicken I'll show you how to put together these beautiful skewers your friends are going to love them let's get to it now I found that my skewers were a little bit long for my pan not a problem put a little mark on them or you want to cut them get yourself a set of pliers or shears and just give them a little snip place them in the pan make sure they're at the right length and on we go and next in our pan we're gonna put about a half an inch of peanut oil turn it up to about a medium heat so here's all our three ingredients we're gonna need we have our egg mixture two eggs and a couple tablespoons of milk and then we have a cup of bread crumbs now to that I'm gonna add some Cajun seasoning there's lots of difference out there but this is my go-to it's called slap yo mama it's delicious give it a try put in at least a teaspoon and then mix it up well you can put more in if you like now next we want a nice fluffy Parmesan you'll see when we dip our chicken into the parmesan how it just melts right into it to achieve that fluffiness you want to use a microplane that's the fluffy texture we're looking for now we're using boneless skinless chicken we're going to cut those into pieces about a 1 inch by 2 inch nice bite-sized pieces then simply just place them on the end of your skewers I've got a few in the pan already going so you put your chicken first into the egg wash then roll it around in your breadcrumbs I like to use a fork to just kind of pack it down in and then you're just going to place it into your oil cook it for about 3 minutes on each side till they're nice and golden brown [Music] when they're fully cooked take them out and just roll them around and that nice fluffy parmesan it just melts right onto the chicken don't they look delicious it's time to lay them up well that was another simple and delicious recipe I had an extra breast of chicken used all the same flavorings cooked at the same way make a meal out of it I've got a little bit of red pepper jelly for dipping and don't forget to subscribe to my videos I put one out every Monday hit the littles red subscribe button and you'll be notified now I'm gonna try the goods these look so delicious little dip [Music] Paul man you're gonna level that sweetness in the red pepper jelly with the Cajun spice a little bit of heat and the saltiness of the parmesan what a perfect match I know you're gonna love him well thanks for coming out I'm watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music] [Music]
