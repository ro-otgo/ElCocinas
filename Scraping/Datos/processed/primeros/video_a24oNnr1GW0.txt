hey lovelies so our soup series continues today with three delicious low-carb soup recipe is that you really have to taste to believe you guys have been asking for more and more low carb recipes on the channel and of course I always love to deliver so today we're starting with this amazing loaded cauliflower soup now if you're not familiar with the term loaded the idea is it tastes a lot like a loaded baked potato so there's bacon there's sour cream there's cheese there's chives you know it can't be bad so if made soup similar to this using potato but since we're going low-carb today I thought it would be awesome to do the same soup but using some cauliflower instead I'm gonna start by cooking up a little bit of bacon I'll cook that bacon up just until it starts to crisp then it's time to add my onion straight into the pot if you wanted to remove a little bit of the bacon fat at this point you definitely could but I'm leaving it all in there because it's going to impart a ton of great flavor into this soup once my onions in the pan it'll only take two or three minutes to soften up then I'll add some garlic to this as well after the garlic has had about 30 seconds to get really flavorful we'll go ahead and add our cauliflower to the pot so for this recipe I'm using a whole head of cauliflower I just chopped it up into florets and I'm gonna get it into the pot with some chicken broth I always like using a really good-quality chicken broth in my soup recipes I find it makes all the difference in the final flavor I'm also going to be adding a helping of cream to this now you could use milk here instead but I find the cream makes for a really really rich soup and then I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil as soon as it reaches a boil I'll reduce my heat to sort of medium-low pop the lid on and let the simmer away until that cauliflower is completely tender usually that takes between say 10 and 15 minutes so I'm gonna turn my heat off completely and the reason I'm going to do that is because I'm actually going to be pure aying this and blending it until it's completely smooth using my immersion blender if you don't have one of these at home I highly recommend buying one they are totally worth their weight in gold they can vary in price a little bit I will link a few in the description box below so you can take a look for yourself because they are so handy especially when it comes to soups right on the stove just like this now when you're using an immersion blender you really want to make sure that the immersion blender stays completely submerged in the soup so that you don't get any dangerous splashes that could burn someone as soon as your soup is nice and smooth you can go ahead and add your finishing ingredients in this case because we are going for that loaded baked potato flavor I have got some sour cream headed in here but I want to make sure to temper my sour cream before adding it back into my pot if you're not familiar with the concept of tempering we're basically going to add a little bit of the hot liquid into the cool sour cream to heat it up before we add it into our soup pot the reason we do that is because adding cold sour cream to our hot soup can cause it to separate and that is not what we're looking for we want a really smooth texture at this point I'm also going to stir in some shredded cheddar cheese for even more great flavor and I've got some finely chopped chives headed in here as well we'll mix that all together and as soon as it's well combined this soup is ready to be enjoy I like serving it up tops with some more cheddar cheese a little bit of bacon and some chives and oh my gosh guys you will absolutely love this soup it's so flavorful you will not even miss the potato I swear next for something equally flavorful and equally low-carb I have got this amazing rustic chicken soup very rarely our low carb recipes this comforting guys I think you're gonna love this one so it all starts once again with my soup pot on the stove I've got a little oil heating up and once my oil is nice and hot I'm going to get to work on cooking up my chicken so here I'm using some boneless skinless chicken breast that's just been cut into cubes you could use thighs here instead those will be really flavorful as well we're just gonna give our chicken a little bit of a head start so I'll season it up with some salt and pepper and cook it just until it's browned then I'm gonna go ahead and add some onion and some celery to my pot the combination of onion and celery in a soup just so perfect and we're just gonna cook that until the onion starts to soften up you'll see your celery start to turn bright green and then I'm gonna go ahead and add some garlic in as well next I've got some diced tomatoes headed into my pot as well as some chicken broth for flavor in this recipe we are going to be using a whole lot of lovely herbs so I've got some rosemary that I finely chopped a little bit of fresh oregano as well as some fresh thyme headed into the pot if you wanted to use dried herbs in this recipe instead of fresh you definitely could but you'd want to cut those measurements in half because dried herbs are a lot more potent than their fresh counterparts I'm also going to be adding a bay leaf to this and then finally the real secret ingredient here is this now this is a parmesan rind so basically when you buy a block of Parmesan cheese and you grade it grate it crate it all you're left with at the end is the rind and what I do is I set these aside in a bag in my refrigerator and when it comes time to make a really delicious soup like this I just pop the entire Ryan straight into the pot and as the soup cooks what it does is infuse the soup with this amazing savory sort of cheesy flavor and then when it's finished cooking all you do is remove the parmesan rind and what's left behind is a ton of great flavor I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil once it's reached a boil we can reduce our heat to medium pop a lid on it and let this cook up for 10 to 15 minutes and then it's just a matter of adding our finishing ingredients but I've got a good helping of kale headed into this Zoop this is a great place to sneak in your greens if you don't want to use kale spinach would work here too and I'm also going to add a little freshly grated Parmesan for good measure and oh my gosh guys this soup is just so packed with tasty flavor your taste buds are going to be celebrating all dinner long speaking of flavor which clearly seems to be the theme in today's video our final recipe is absolutely packed with it it's my curried cauliflower soup and oh my gosh guys you won't believe how tasty it is now this one all starts with a little coconut oil heating up in my soup pot well my coconut oil is anthalie melted I'm gonna go ahead and add some onion and a little bit of carrot to this now I know technically carrots are not the lowest carb ingredient but they're not super high carb either and I think they add a nice body to this if you wanted to skip the carrots in this recipe definitely go right ahead it's up to you I like that they add a little bit of color and add a little extra nutrition to this dish next I'm going to add a little garlic and some ginger to this at this point I'm also going to be adding my superstar ingredient some curry powder and then I'm gonna smash a bunch of glass on the counter it's always good to allow your curry powder to have a quick head start on the heat it warms up all of its spices and makes it even more flavorful then we are going to get our cauliflower into the pot as well as our broth and our coconut milk to keep this recipe completely vegan I'm using vegetable broth here and I'm also using both fat coconut milk here which I find has the best texture I'll hit this up with little salt and a little pepper and then I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil once it's reached to boil it we can reduce our heat to medium pop a lid on it and let this cook up for 10 to 15 minutes just until that cauliflower is completely tender at this point it's time to turn my heat off completely give it a puree with our immersion blender and it is ready to be served up this could not be more perfect we have such a beautiful texture here my last step with this nice velvety soup is just going to be stirring in freshly chopped cilantro and it's as simple as that this is a low carb vegan soup that you can feel really good about and it makes excellent leftovers for lunch the next
