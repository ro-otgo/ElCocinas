[Music] okay we all know this is like the best time of year because of all of the delicious food and at the very top of that list for me is appetizers I know you guys love them too so today I'm going to be sharing some very easy and delicious appetizer recipes all using crescent roll dough these are gonna be so so good so for this first recipe we are making meatball sub cupcakes y'all these are going to be so good great appetizer you could also freeze your leftovers have them for like a quick and easy lunch you'll need like a cupcake or muffin pan you'll need some frozen Italian style meatballs and these do not have to be thawed you'll also need some mozzarella some softened cream cheese some spaghetti sauce Italian seasoning and then of course your crescent roll does to get started I'm going to go ahead and preheat our oven to 375 and then if you have the crescent roll dough sheet that would work great since I don't I'm going to press my seems together and then we're going to cut 12 even like little squares [Music] okay now in our little Bowl here you're just gonna need four ounces of cream cheese so half of a block and I just sit mine on this stove while it's heating up that way I can kind of bring it to room temperature and make it easier to mix next we're going to add in about 3 4 of a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and of course I'm just gonna eyeball it it's probably good then we're gonna do one cup of shredded mozzarella cheese so just mix this until it's all combined sometimes you gotta get in there with your hands that's what I did to mix our cream cheese worked out great but we are going to go ahead and assemble these I'm going to lightly spray our muffin pan and then we'll Place each one of our squares of Crescent dough in here and then we'll assemble with our cream cheese meatball spaghetti sauce top it with mozzarella these are going to be amazing [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] look so good my mouth is watering so we're gonna pop these in the oven at 375 for just like 15 to 18 minutes someone down here is just so excited for all of that mozzarella cheese that I keep dropping y'all these are gonna be so good My Bunkie is going to love this and like I said freezing it using leftovers that's like a little easy lunch such a great idea okay I've got my taste tester down here these were so easy to make and I wanted to tell y'all I don't know how they got 12 squares other crazy roll though because I tried I only got nine and I don't think they could be any smaller because then they wouldn't fit like in the muffin pan so maybe you just try 9 to 12. but we're gonna let Bunkie taste test this I found a good one actually you know what I found interesting what is how you've got these These are nice with their little pointy edges yes yes I like that rather than it being round well you know what what it's because my squares were bigger than probably the person's recipe that got this from um starting out with a little crispy cheese okay cheese skirt that's what they call it okay monkeys request when I told him I was making these was he said just make sure that crescent roll dough is all done because y'all know he doesn't like soggy dough how did I do that little uh what is it ricotta something funky that's like a little pocket of tree of goodness isn't it that's the game changer that really takes it over the top I was waiting for you to get to it because that's just like a little treasure mine down there it's just cream cheese and mozzarella and Italian seasoning this might even ricotta but ricotta would be good yeah both of cream cheese their color might be too oh wet like it might make it soggy the cream cheese is perfect I think with it being in the oven too it kind of like fluffed up a little bit if that's possible how is this what is this described as a meatball no meatball sub cupcake that is exactly what it sounds like it tastes like rather this is really good yeah it is exactly like eating a meatball sub but in a nice little handheld version of all the flavors there it's really good I would dare say this is better than the pizza dip really in the crock pot bunky are you serious hi accolades right here wow y'all know that means these things are good okay good okay y'all are not even ready for this second recipe because we are taking like two of the very best appetizers of all time and combining them so we have like The Best of Both Worlds we're taking pigs in a blanket and we're taking jalapeno poppers and we are making jalapeno popper pigs in a blanket and they're gonna be so good and you know what I'm laughing about how come every time I'm like searching on Pinterest or just like looking for recipes all of the recipes that I love and want to try all have cream cheese I'm like why is that because this one has cream cheese too but we have our solving cream cheese I'm gonna go ahead and add some shredded cheddar to that some bacon bits if you want to do regular chopped bacon by all means that would be even better I'm just gonna like save that step and then want some seasonings in there start assembling these bad boys okay so to my bowl I have some shredded cheddar cheese I'm gonna add in our cream cheese and then like I said I'm just gonna use these real bacon pieces but feel free to like cook and chop up some bacon if you want to okay that is going in and then to season this I'm gonna add a little bit of Auntie no nose it has like that garlic and onion salt in there so it has really good flavor okay like last time I'm just gonna go in with my hands because that's just the best way to do it if you ask me okay I've got a tip for y'all if you've been around here for a while you know that like one of my very favorite tried and true appetizer recipes is my bacon and cheese bites my mom and I make these for like every single part and get together they are the best of the best but that is basically the exact same feeling that goes into those minus Auntie no-nos so you could just make a big batch of that filling and then you can knock out two appetizers at once make this recipe as well as a bacon and cheese bites so just a little tip and also one more tip if you do use the inky no nose you guys know it's pretty salty so just go very light on it since it already has bacon otherwise you could just do like ranch seasoning or garlic powder whatever seasonings you want to but I just wanted to add that in there so you don't add too much okay so now we are going to prepare our jalapenos if you want to wear gloves by all means but you're just going to like rinse them off and then cut off the top of them and then cut them in half we're going to get out all of those seeds and membrane and then we're going to cut them in half again we're actually going to put these in the oven for about 15 minutes before we actually make our pigs in a blanket um just to make sure they're nice and soft so I'm just taking a spoon and getting out all those seeds and membrane and it just comes right out clean [Music] okay I've got the oven on 350 and these will just take about 15 minutes okay let me show you what we're gonna do with the crescent roll do I kind of just pinch the seams together and this is only half of it I have the other half right here but we're going to take it and cut it like into strips because we're gonna basically like wrap this around the jalapeno and the little smoky so I'm kind of just doing like one inch pieces okay I just did one to kind of test it out so here's how we're going to do this take your strip and put your jalapeno kind of like on the edge over here and then to the jalapeno We'll add a little bit of our cream cheese cheese and bacon mixture kind of like put it right there on top my little more because why not I can't have too much right okay and then you're just gonna like stick your little smoky on there and then just kind of start wrapping it up and then we'll pop these on our baking sheet and put them in the oven if your um crescent roll kind of starts to come undone just pinch your seams together again so just like that this would actually work even better if you just had the dough sheets instead of the kind that has the seam so next time I will remember that [Music] okay I decided to try it with just like the triangle like without cutting it into strips just how it kind of already comes and I think this is gonna work just as good if not better you can get more of the cheese mixture in there okay yes this is how I should have done all of them just use your little triangle uh I may or may not have just broken the trash cans I need you to get peek at that okay and I'm also like cracking up at myself because I made all of our little like little smoky jalapeno pepper bombs Bunkie calls them over here but I had some crescent roll dough left and I was like um I want to make a little breakfast one so I made some sausage and then add that cream cheese mixture so that's what's in like these three but we're just gonna pop these in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes okay I gotta say these look great mommy said this is his dinner I'm proud of the way those turned out I'm very proud you know why why because one of your things is like always making sure that crescent roll is done and those look perfectly golden brown see I'm excited about the uh the change in texture we got on this jalapeno yes looking good well that's because I put them in the oven for like 15 minutes to get soft before I even assembled this that's how you have to do it that checks all the boxes for a handheld goodie oh yeah is it like a flavor explosion that that would be a good way to describe it yeah there's a there's so many different flavors going on what I what I really think is interesting is the way that the uh the little smoky and the bacon they're kind of like they're like playing it off of each other it's like the little bit of bacon in there is really enhancing a little smoky oh okay but the little smokies bring in like the hot dog Vibe yeah but then you got some nice accompaniment of the of the Jalapeno in there cooking the jalapeno a little bit in advance very important it makes it soften up a little bit yeah nice wow okay I love it this one in particular is not it's a little bit more extremely spicy it's more mild nice flavor okay that's what I'm talking about of the crescent roll game this is one of my favorites that you've that you've put before me B okay okay they're gonna be so happy well that's what's for

everything laid out here to make this recipe we're gonna call these like a little re-bomb I think they are going to be delicious so first things first is you're going to need a can of crescent rolls if you want to get the one that's like a dough sheet that's already that doesn't have any seam means by all means I just already had these in the fridge so I'm gonna use them but first thing you want to do is roll this out and then pinch all of your little seams together um the actual recipe says to cut this into 24 even pieces but since again it's just being funky I'm not going to be too precise unless you want to do the math oh I'm going to be precise oh okay I'm gonna let Bunkie cut our crescent roll dough since you know he's way more precise than me but basically we are just going to cut little teeny even bite-sized squares okay so now that we have our crescent rolls cut into little bite size pieces you're just going to take a mini muffin tin pan and I am going to go ahead and lightly spray it so that they don't stick and then we'll kind of press down our little crescent roll and then we're going to cut our Brie into bite-sized pieces as well and we'll put a little piece of this Brie inside each one and then I'll show you guys the rest of the ingredients [Music] thank you okay so now that we have our Brie in there we're just going to take a little bit of apricot preserves and put on top of it you could also do like fig or raspberry kind of like whatever Jam you want I just love apricot especially with brie and then we're going to also put some chopped pecans on there so you're just gonna take a little Spoonful and put like a little dollop on top of each one [Applause] [Music] okay so next we are just going to top those with a little bit of these chopped pecans and then a little bit of flaky sea salt the salt is going to take it over the top [Music] okay and that is it these are going into the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes okay these are out the oven y'all they look so good I just have them on my cute little Christmas Spode um Christmas tree little platter and then I'll have two over here on my cooling rack for Bunkie and I to taste test I am so excited to try these I do want to tell you when they come out of the oven they kind of look messy but once I got them out of the um pan they were perfectly fine cheers foreign oh my goodness whoa this is so good what are you laughing about I'm trying to find my words to describe this because it's like ridiculous the first little thing I tasted was the pecans and then a little bit of sweetness from that uh apricot but then the Brie comes in at the back the brie is so warm and melty and like oh my gosh it really is these things are worth totally worth making like you cannot just eat one you eat like a hundred because they're so good I try to tell you we needed to make all 24 I tried to tell you okay so now let's get started on this next recipe so of course you will need some crescent rolls some pecans you don't have to put these in there but I think the crunch will be really nice you'll also need just a little bit of brown sugar and some apple pie spice you'll also need a granny smith apple and then one more ingredient that is also optional is some caramel drizzle this one is a salted caramel which oh my gosh it's so good I think I'm gonna drizzle this on top once they come out of the oven but these are going to be super simple to make a great little breakfast or dessert they're going to be so delicious foreign [Music] okay so to get started on our little apple pad bites I just have some melted butter right here and I'm gonna toss my spiced apples into the melted butter and just kind of stir those around until they're nice and coated and then next I'm going to take my brown sugar I'm going to add a little bit of my apple spice to this and give it a good stir foreign [Music] [Music] okay so now I'm taking my brown sugar and apple pie spice mixture I'm just going to sprinkle this right on top of each one [Music] then we're going to take our chopped pecans and just sprinkle a few of those on as well [Music] thank you [Music] okay so once you have them wrapped up you're going to take your leftover melted butter you're gonna brush this on the top and then we're gonna sprinkle them with a little bit more of that apple pie spice foreign [Music] at 375 for about 10 to 12 minutes [Music] okay and for the best part this caramel drizzle oh my gosh these are going to be amazing and I even have some cookie dough ice cream because why not I mean that looks like a dessert I want to eat I know you want to bite of that like right now hand it all over babe hand it all over I'm gonna let you get a bite first but then I want to bite I can feel the warmth under in my on my hand under the plate yes handheld little baked apple pie bites yeah oh well I'm liking the texture so far wow that's really good I'm gonna get into the center here okay take a little bite with some ice cream yeah we didn't have any vanilla so I felt like the chocolate chip cookie dough would be just fun I ate all of the vanilla ice cream yesterday actually I figured yep it's delicious yes this is good and y'all these are so simple to make [Music] well when I was um like a very young boy a little boy my grandparents up in Norfolk Virginia I think for some reason we would have these little smokies like we would eat them for breakfast part of our breakfast for some reason so that might be why they they hold a special place in my heart oh bunky shout out to all my people in Chesapeake Bay Area laughs that's so sweet yeah I feel like your mom still eats these all the time I love them I mean and and then I remember too as I'll go into another story for you I feel like little smokies are one of those things like you would always you don't eat them very often but it would always be one of those things and this might have been like back in the 90s or something but you would have them with um it would always be like at a Super Bowl party yeah and where you put like grape jelly or something oh yeah like barbecue sauce yeah yes that's what it was we have some leftovers I'll make you that those were always my favorite people will do that with meatballs I don't love it as much with meatballs okay you do it with little smokies that's the game changer I'm making that for you tomorrow in the crock pot because I love little smokies all day weekend all weekend okay I hope you guys got all of the holiday appetizer inspo if you want even more appetizer
