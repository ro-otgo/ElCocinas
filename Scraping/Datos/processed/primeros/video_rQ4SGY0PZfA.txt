hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete my motto is always simple and delicious and we'll follow on that today because we're making some shrimp cakes you might have heard of crab cakes this is shrimp cakes they're so delicious we're gonna make a nice dipping sauce let's get to it pour our sauce in a bowl we're starting off with 1 cup of sour cream and to that we will add a tablespoon of mayonnaise and we'll add a half of a green onions finely diced up and some dill a tablespoon of dill fresh the diced and we're got a half a teaspoon of garlic powder a tablespoon of fresh squeezed lemon a little bit of salt and pepper to taste and then finally your favorite hot sauce as much as you like I'm gonna put a generous portion in here gives it a great flavor that's up to you we'll mix that all up we'll get that in the fridge and it's just about time to start making our shrimp cakes so I'll be using my electric mixer I'm going to be starting off with a cup of shrimp just a small size shrimp these are a boat go 25 to 30 to a pound and this here is about a half a pound of shrimp to that we'll add one scallion nicely diced up also known as a green onion and then we're going to add the zest of a half of a lemon and then one finely diced clove of garlic fresh from my garden what a teaspoon of all Bay seasoning this is a go-to for me whenever I'm cooking any type of seafood and one teaspoon of Dijon mustard and one beaten egg I'm going to use the pulse on this mixer because they don't want to over mix it you still want it a bit chunky and the last thing we'll add is a third a cup of breadcrumbs I have an Italian seasoned breadcrumbs you can use Planko whatever works for you just want to try and absorb some of that moisture perfect now this will take out scoop it into a bowl and then I'm going to let that sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes [Music] I have my shrimp mixture already here I'm just gonna use a soup spoon to just kind of get it into equal portions you can make them as big as you like what I like to do is have a little place to dab some oil and this is just some olive oil you dab it on your fingers and it helps when you're molding these so they don't all stick to your fingers so these are fairly small I'm gonna pop them into little cakes and then I have some bread crumbs just beside it here you're gonna get a little bit of bread crumbs on each side and then I've got a sheet here of parchment paper we'll put those down on there I'll carry on with these and then we'll get them into the oven [Music] you [Music] [Applause] they're all ready to get into the oven you can fry these up if you like on the stovetop a little bit of peanut oil fry them up that'll work too but I think I'll choose a healthy weight today in the oven 400 degrees we'll flip them after about 10 minutes let's get them in the oven 10 minutes and we'll flip them okay it's been 10 minutes let's take them out and flip them they smell delicious back in the oven for another 10 minutes it's been 20 minutes you know what time it is it's time to taste them there goes another simple and delicious recipe I hope you enjoyed it and if you like my video don't forget to subscribe hit the red subscribe button you'll be notified every Monday it's time to try the goods my favorite part I'm just going to use my fingers in here Oh [Music] all mine hmm a little bit of crunch on the outside that fresh dill and shrimp come through and that sauce is a knock oh well thanks for watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see
