[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today we're doing risotto I used to think it was a complicated process but it's not you need a bit of time so take your time set out an hour of the day it takes about 25 minutes but by the time you dice and slice get yourself a glass of wine enjoy the ride risottos fun to cook if you have the time I'd like to give a shout out to Ryan Stewart for this recipe better known as Stewie I retired from the fire hall five years ago hard to believe time flies when you're having fun well when I worked at the fire hall was Stewie he shared some great recipes and still does today not only a great firefighter but pretty amazing in the kitchen - thanks doing let's get to it we're using arborio rice it's an Italian short grain rice it's high in starch and that's what gives risotto its creamy texture let's start off and prepare our vegetables we'll need one half of a large onion finely diced one bunch of fresh asparagus just simply snap the tough ends off and discard those and then we'll dice up our asparagus into half-inch pieces [Music] if you're a garlic fan like I am we gotta add so let me show you a quick technique commence your garlic to remove the paper like cover over the clove simply smash it and then give it a little snip off of each end and the paper will just fall right off now finally dice the clove of garlic but that's not going to be fine enough to add to our risotto so we're going to use some coarse sea salt this will be like an abrasive it will just smooth out our garlic so when we add it to the risotto it will all mix nice and even once you've learned this technique you'll wonder why you ever bought jarred minced garlic the fresh flavor of it is so much better [Music] my badge is all prepped now one more thing we have to do before we get making our risotto we're going to boil the asparagus will only boil this for two and a half minutes then we'll drain it and set it aside as we'll add this to our risotto a little later on we're going to need six and a half cups of broth of course a homemade broth is always preferred but here's an option this is called better than booyah it's a chicken base you just mix it with hot water it has some great flavor and the other option is a vegetable this also comes in an organic vegetable base low and sodium it's delicious I mix the two together and do half chicken half vegetable bring it to a boil and then just set it off on a side burner on low add three tablespoons of olive oil to a nonstick deep sided and my Heat's on medium my objective is just to soften up the onions it'll take about 4-5 minutes now we'll add our two cups of arborio rice stir it thoroughly to ensure that it gets coated with the oil continue to stir for three or four minutes and then we're going to add one cup of dry wine I'm using a Pinot Grigio just because that's what I like to drink I'm gonna load a medium heat and we'll stir until that's absorbed now we can start the process of adding our broth first we'll add two ladles of broth when you're doing this process of adding the broth slowly remember you're not whipping up a Marais take your time stir it slowly you want to get all that broth absorbed take your time it'll come out nice and smooth you'll end up with a nice luxurious risotto now this process of adding one ladle of broth at a time it's going to take 20 to 25 minutes as the liquid dissipates you just simply add another ladle of your broth and stir it in gently [Music] and don't leave the stove you got a baby set this dish take your time it'll all come together as we reach the end of adding our broth to the Arroyo rice you'll notice it becoming more creamy each time that's from the high starch content in a Wario rice give it a taste the rice should have a slight chew to it and we'll add a couple pinches of salt we're not done yet let's add four tablespoons of butter that will help get it even more creamier and smooth and our minced garlic stir that in well and now we'll add one cup of fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano [Music] and now we can add our asparagus and look how nice and creamy it is that's what you're looking for add three or four freshly chopped basil leaves place a lid on it for five minutes and it's ready to serve it up risotto is such a versatile dish can be used as a main or a side a nice mean for this is always chicken maybe a nice balsamic chicken whatever you choose this risotto is so delicious look how creamy it is just lays on the plate and spreads out oh boy my mouth is watering [Music] now that wasn't so difficult was it and risotto goes together with all sorts of things like seafood mushrooms and asparagus and I'm gonna give it a try Wow it's creamy the asparagus is just cooked perfect you get a hit of the parmesan and that slight hint of garlic that we put in there you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music]
