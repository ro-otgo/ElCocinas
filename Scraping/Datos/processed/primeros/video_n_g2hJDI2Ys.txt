soup as always I am working in my nice big soup pot on the stove if you don't have a soup pot like this might I recommend you invest in one it's one of the best kitchen spends you will ever make I have linked a couple of my favorites in the description box as well if you're looking for one I've got my soup pot heating up over medium-high heat and I'm going to start by browning up some bacon now if you didn't want to use pork in this recipe you could use some chicken here instead but obviously bacon lends a ton of great flavor to this recipe I'm going to cook my bacon just until it starts to crisp up and then I'm going to add the trifecta of amazing soup ingredients some onion celery and carrots these are all total classics when it comes to soup I'm going to cook those just until they start to soften so maybe three to four minutes and as soon as they start to soften up and that celery turns bright green we can go ahead and add some garlic to the pot as well once that garlic hits the pan your kitchen is going to start smelling even more amazing if that's possible and that means it is time to get a little white wine in here now if you want to skip this step you definitely can you don't have to use the white wine but it adds a ton of beautiful flavor and then I'm just gonna let that simmer away for two to three minutes that gives it time the alcohol to evaporate and all you'll be left with is this amazing flavor at this point it's time to add our beans to the pot these are cannellini beans or white kidney beans I'm using canned beans that I've drained and rinsed once those are in there we can add our chicken broth to the pot as well as a nice splash of cream or even more great flavor in this recipe I'm using some rosemary some thyme and a bay leaf in addition to those amazing herbs we are going to be amplifying the flavor factor by the power of 10 using a parmesan rind so if you've never used one of these in your cooking you were in for a total treat basically when you buy a piece of parmesan you grate it until all that's left is the Ryann and what I do is I hold on to these keep them in a zipper bag in my refrigerator and when I'm making a soup like this I pop the rhein right into the soup and it imparts the most amazing savory cheesy flavor into whatever you're making the next step is just bringing this mixture to a boil and once it's reached a boil we can go ahead and pop a lid on our pot reduce our heat to medium-low and let this just simmer away for say 15 to 20 minutes it doesn't take very long for this to get really really super flavorful so what I like to do is just use a slotted spoon to sort of lift out our sprigs of thyme and our bay leaf they have done all the work we need them to do which is lovely and then you have the option to serve it really chunky and rustic like this or to use an immersion blender like this to get it a little smoother when you're working with an immersion blender you want to make sure that your heat is totally off and that you have it fully submerged at all time otherwise you can get dangerous flash ups I'm doing a bit of a 1/2 puree here so I want it to be nice and thick and creamy and texture but I also want to leave some of those ingredients intact at this point we can finish the soup off with another helping of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and some freshly chopped parsley what is not to love about this soup guys I like serving it up with a little bit of fresh parsley and a nice side of crusty French bread for all you mushroom lovers out there have I got the soup for you this is a creamy garlic mushroom soup it's essentially a classic cream of mushroom soup except with a really garlicky kick I've got my soup pot heating up on the stove and of course to that I am going to add some butter as soon as that butter is melted I am going to load in my mushrooms now you'll see it looks like we have a lot of mushrooms happening here but as you know mushrooms lose a ton of their volume while they're cooking so a lot becomes a little pretty quickly I'm using a combination today of some cremini mushrooms that I've done they sliced as well as some shitake mushrooms I like the combination of mushrooms here but if you only wanted to use creaminess or white button mushrooms in this recipe that definitely works once those mushrooms hit the pot we'll season them up with a little salt and a little pepper and then we'll let them cook down for between five and six minutes stirring them frequently and tell they start to brown and release a lot of their moisture and then it's time to add our garlic now I'm using three cloves of garlic in this recipe that is a lot of garlic so if you want to dial it back a bit you can but it's creamy garlic mushroom soup so feel like you need the garlic we're gonna let that garlic heat up for maybe thirty Seconds to a minute and then it's time to add a little flour to the pot the flour is going to help our soup thicken up while it cooks but it's important to cook off that floury taste first so I'm going to cook my flour for maybe a minute or two while stirring it constantly so that it doesn't burn next I'm gonna go ahead and add my mushroom broth to the pot if you have trouble finding mushroom broth where you are you can swap in some chicken or beef broth here as well both will work but of course mushroom broth has a really great mushroom flavor speaking of flavor I've got two more ingredient additions that will add just that a little splash of soy sauce is headed into this soup as well as some fresh thyme we'll go in and get the sprigs out afterwards but in the meantime hahaha time they are going to impart a ton of beautiful flavor I'm also going to add a good helping of cream to this now you could do this with milk but we are talking about a fall comfort food cooking just use the cream enjoy the cream I'm just going to bring this mixture to a boil and as soon as it reached a boil I will reduce my heat to low and let it simmer for maybe 10 minutes or so that's really all it takes now you have a couple options you can serve the soup chunky just as it is but I actually like to give it a quick to help it get nice and thick and rich but I also want to preserve some of that great texture of the mushrooms so what I like to do is just use a slotted spoon to sort of lift out a good helping of the mushrooms and we're gonna add them back in once we smooth everything out as far as an easy weeknight soup option this one really can't be beat you can prepare the entire thing in under 20 minutes on the stove finally guys when a chill hits the air nothing will warm you up quite like this amazing sausage kale and gnocchi soup and you're not gonna believe how easy it is to make it starts once again of course with a soup pot on the stove and just heating up a little bit of oil once our oil is nice and hot we can get some sausage into the pot I am using some mild Italian sausage you have the option to use hot italian sausage if you wanted to what's cool is that the sausage itself has so much flavoring that you don't need to add very much to it to make it delicious now I have removed the sausage from its casing and I'm just gonna use my spoon to break it up while it's cooking I want to get it into a little bit as soon as that sausage is cooked we're gonna add some onion to the pot we'll let that cook for another 2 to 3 minutes next we're gonna go ahead and add some garlic to the pan and I'm also going to add some red chili flakes here now these are totally optional if you are not in to the heat you leave the red chili flakes out next I'll go ahead and add some chicken broth to my pot as well as a splash of cream we'll bring this mixture to a simmer reduce our heat to medium and then we're going to get our gnocchi into the pot so no key is basically a potato based pasta you can usually find it fresh in the deli aisle at your supermarket or frozen in the freezer section it's really pillowy and delicious and the cool part about gnocchi if you're not familiar with cooking with it is when it's ready which only usually takes 2 or 3 minutes it's going to rise to the top of your pot and as soon as you see the gnocchi start rising that's how you know it is time to add your kale which is only going to require a few minutes to well down you could also use spinach if you wanted to that would work definitely in this recipe as well then I'm gonna hit this with a little salt and a little pepper and guys you will have a soup that you absolutely
