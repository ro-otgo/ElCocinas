[Applause] [Music] hi folks are welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today's simple and delicious recipe is Vietnamese spring rolls Ike read these things and the fabulous peanut sauce that's on the side oh my goodness it would taste good on a hockey stick let's start off with the sauce and get our noodles going so for our noodles bringing a small pot of water to a boil we're gonna be using a rice vermicelli it's a thin dry noodle and you just want enough water for it to cover the vermicelli once your water comes to a boil as mine has we're gonna plop that in there we'll shut the heat off let it sit for three minutes and then drain it under cool water for peanut sauce we'll start out with a teaspoon of olive oil one garlic clove finely diced we'll move that around just to get the flavors of the garlic out in the oil you know lower my heat down close a little closer to a low low medium and we'll add our peanut butter use a creamy peanut butter we've got a third of a cup here and then we'll add our half cup of hoisin sauce you can find hosen sauce around the Asian ingredients areas here the soya sauce which is our next item we've got two tablespoons of soya sauce 1 tablespoon of lime juice 1 tablespoon of brown sugar now I like to put a little bit of heat in the mind this is optional I'm gonna add a little hot chilli sauce that's optional and do that to taste and once that's all mixed well together we'll add a little bit of water just to get it to the consistency that I want you don't want it a sticky paste a little bit of water I like to give everybody a a little dipping ball of this when I serve my spring rolls and then I'll top it off find the diced up peanuts so there it is that's a nice consistency there now let's get over and do the spring rolls my shrimp I'll be slicing in high this way they'll lay nice and flat on my wraps so these are cooked shrimp pull the tail off and you're just going to slice it across the back use a sharp knife and that's all it'll lay nice and flat and we'll remember to lay these pink side down that gives the spring roll a nice presentation after it's wrapped up so here's what we'll need to get prepared to make our spring rolls I have my wrappers and I have a little pan of water to warm up the wrappers prior to rolling my noodles are all ready remember with the noodles I had a package of about 225 grams which is about 8 ounces I didn't use even a quarter of it so don't cook too much and I'm doing for spring rolls here I have all my vegetables and shrimp all nicely cut up I have my Boston lettuce it's a nice soft lettuce they come in big leaves like so and I cut them in half our red bell pepper everything nice and finely diced up that's the key to making these rolls then I have some fresh bean sprouts a shrimp on Icee diced up carrots everything oh nice and finely sliced up julienne style finely diced matchstick style whatever you want to call it nice and thinly diced and our cucumber same thing nice finally dice this will make the job much easier then over here I have some fresh basil I'll put a couple of those on each roll and some cilantro and then some mint leaves a couple of mint leaves on each one so don't overstuff them I'll show you how to roll them up let's get to it I'm gonna put my spring roll wrapper slide it into the warm water he is don't leave it in there long both sides are nice and wet and that's it you leave it in too long these things are a nightmare to work with so we're gonna start off with high lettuce and then let's just work our way around here a couple slices of red pepper some bean sprouts carrots cucumbers and let's put our basil and mint and cilantro everywhere Miceli and a shrimp pink side down about a third of the way down on your rap you put your shrimp now begin to rap try and keep it snug as you can without tearing the rap after you get over to a full roll you can bring in the ends like so and then we'll just continue rolling and voila look at that a lovely spring roll it takes a while to get the hang of it but once you do it's a piece of cake so continue whipping these off and then we'll plate them up [Music] there they are pleaded up they look delicious time to try them oh well that was another simple and delicious recipe these Vietnamese spring rolls are so versatile for an appetizer for lunch for dinner or on a picnic I know I love them and now I'm going to try that peanut sauce I love it Oh crunchy fresh light and healthy you're going to Louisville well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete you can check me out on Facebook and in the kitchen with Pete or you can subscribe to this channel and then you'll be notified every Monday when I put out a new video give me a thumbs up or just say hello anyways thanks for coming out until next time Xenia [Music]
