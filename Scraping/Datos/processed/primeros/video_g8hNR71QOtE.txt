as you all know all autumn long I've been sharing tasty soup recipes and I've been asking for your suggestions a one that keeps coming up is cream of broccoli so today I'm going to show you a really easy version of cream of broccoli soup that is totally delicious just before we get to that I have two announcements to make first step we are going to be doing a Q&A video very soon so if you have any questions that you'd like to ask leave them in the comment section below and I'll try to get to as many as I possibly can second I wanted to let you all know that we are still fundraising to build a vegetable garden for a school in Kenya this project is in partnership with three the children and every penny donated goes directly to them so if you haven't donated already I would really really appreciate your support for this project we're trying to raise $25,000 and well it sounds like a big goal I know that together we can totally reach it as a thank you for your donation I'll be sending out a free ebook once we reach our goal so please donate what you can all right now let's get to some cream of broccoli soup this recipe is so simple but so delicious and oh so comforting as always I am starting with my trusty Dutch oven on the stove and I'm going to get started with some butter some of you like to ask if I use unsalted butter and I of course respond what's unsalted butter once my butter is completely melted I'm going to add some finely diced onion and some finely diced celery now there are mixed feelings about adding celery to cream with broccoli soup but I feel like the mixture of onion and celery anywhere is always a good thing we're going to saute our onion and celery mixture until it's soft and translucent now to help me thicken this beautiful soup up I am adding some good old-fashioned all-purpose flour this is actually going to prevent me from having to add too much cream so it's actually a lot less dairy in this recipe than you might think once you add your flour you want to make sure you're stirring your mixture constantly because otherwise the flour will burn next you probably won't find this hard to believe broccoli goes into the pot as you'll see I'm using both broccoli florets and broccoli stalks in this recipe broccoli stalks have a ton of nutrients and cream of broccoli soup is a perfect place to use them what I like to do is peel them with a vegetable peeler and then cut them into bite-sized pieces next we are going to cover all of this yumminess with some frost veg or chicken take your pick no one's judging when that baby starts to bubble away please go in and add some seasoning we're going to bring this mixture to a boil and then reduce our heat to medium-low on goes the lid and we're going to let this baby simmer for about 20 minutes or until our broccoli is super duper soft once our broccoli is completely cooked we are going to turn our heat down to low and use an immersion blender to puree our soup great part about this recipe is that you can make this soup as smooth or as chunky as you want to I like something in the middle and then of course our finishing touch is to add some beautiful heavy cream you definitely want to try this in your kitchen once I've added my cream I like to let my soup simmer for another five minutes or so and then it's ready to serve in my house it's always served with some shredded cheddar cheese this soup is rich savory satisfying and it'll warm you up from the inside out I really hope you'll give this tasty recipe a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you guys know I love hearing from you and don't forget if you have any questions you'd like to include in our upcoming Q&A be sure to leave them in the comment section below and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there's lots more deliciousness where this came from
