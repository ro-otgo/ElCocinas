[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete as we approach fall people start thinking about soups I think about soups all the time I dream about soups I get inspired about soups just take a walk through the grocery store a friend of mine gave me a nice squash the other day and that inspired me to make this wonderful recipe coconut courage squash soup Oh outstanding even if you don't like curry I'll have alternatives for you we'll take it oh and it'll still be delicious let's get cooking I'm using an acorn squash butternut squash is a great option to just simply cut it in half and remove the seeds then we'll drizzle on a little bit of olive oil and spread it around with our fingers place it onto a cookie sheet and into the oven 400 degrees for 15 minutes out of the oven they come and you can tell when they're done when you can slide a knife into them very easily they're nice and soft just scoop it out into a bowl and then we'll set that off to the side in a pan on a medium heat a lot of half a cup of onions finely diced 2 teaspoons of olive oil 1/2 a cup of celery finely diced 1/2 a cup of carrots finely diced and then we'll cook that for 4 to 5 minutes a lot two cloves of garlic finely diced a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of pepper and a teaspoon of minced ginger curry powder is our next ingredient if you're not a fan of it leave it out this is a vindaloo curry that my good friend Gus puts together outstanding flavors and thin dilute typically has a bit of heat so if that's not for you just add your regular curry powder take a minute to stir it in and enjoy the wonderful aroma [Music] now let's bring our squash back into the pan give that a good stir mix it all well and now we're going to add two cups of chicken broth and eight ounces of coconut milk now a good option is to give the soup a little bit of sweetness once we've stirred that up you can add either two teaspoons of sugar or I add one package of stevia it offsets some of those big old flavours we've added cover it and let simmer for 30 minutes and then it's time to blend it up I like my immersion blender it saves a lot of hassle not having to remove the soup putting it into a stand up blender you can tell when it's ready it's nice and smooth just run a spoon through it and you can see how nice and silky it is pull I think it's time to put myself up all together [Music] there it is already fit big into doesn't that look like it's gonna warm up your belly well I hope you get a chance to try this one the flavours are unbelievable you can top it off with a little bit of sour cream or Greek yogurt or a little bit of diced up cilantro or some spring onions you're gonna love this one I hope you enjoy this recipe I have lots more out there I'm approaching a hundred videos and if you like them hit the little red subscribe button and you'll get notified every Monday when I put on a new one now I'm gonna try the goods oh look how silky it is oh man packed with flavor great for a nice fall or winter evening you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time say for the next crib training level I the way I do well if you know maybe [Music] [Music]
