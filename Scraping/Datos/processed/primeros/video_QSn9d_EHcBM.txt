[Music] you hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious is always my model today we're gonna mess around with some frozen pastry that I get from the grocery store and then we'll use our own stuffings one a traditional pizza style the next one is an old New Orleans favorite a muffaletta sandwich will incorporate those flavors into a puff pastry it's outstanding you're gonna love it let's get cookin let's start out with our buffalo filling we've got some Italian sliced meat we're gonna start off with our six slices of mortadella a nice Italian meat six slices of salami and six slices of ham now we need to chop this up so simply roll up each stack of meat cut it down the center a couple of times and then chop it up we'll go through all our meats our objective here is to get them roughly about the same size and then we'll put them into a bowl now here's our jar of muffuletta salad mix you'll find that in most grocery stores around the pickles it comes in either hot or mild the choice is yours we're going to use 1 cup of our muffuletta mix and then we're going to add two cups of provolone and mozzarella mixture even amounts of both give it a good mix set it aside and we'll get to our second filling we're gonna do a pizza filling in one of our pastries for our pizza filling they're gonna need 30 slices of a good quality pepperoni we're gonna cut those into quarters and then we've got for fresh basil leaves roll them up like into a little cigar and then we'll finely dice those and place this all into a bowl and to that we'll add three cups of Italian mixed grated cheese 1/2 cup of olives 1/2 teaspoon of oregano 2 tablespoons of red onions finely diced 1 cup of pizza sauce and then mix all well we'll set that aside and let's get to our puff pastry so I'm using a store-bought puff pastry comes to in a box take 1 Oh simply unwrap it and lay it out flat now the key to any puff pastry is using lots of flour otherwise things get to be a sticky mess some on your hands as well and a little bit on your roller now these pastries come out to about 10 inch by 10 inch all we need is about an extra 2 inches that gives us a perfect thickness for our pastry so with a few gentle rolls we can gain about 2 inches on each side of our pastry and we'll end up with about 12 inches by 12 inches now we'll need a sharp knife and cut slits about every one and a half inches on both sides noticing noting down the center because that's where our filling is going to go so these slits will be about 3 inches long we'll start out with our pizza pastry simply lay the filling down the center take a little bit of time and spread that filling out evenly starting at one end begin to fold over the pastry they're going to overlap one another the two ends and go lengthways and then begin to fold in the sides Criss crossing each one that's what gives it that lovely look after it comes out of the oven now have a sheet pan ready with some parchment paper on top I use a big flipper to help transfer it over and now let's start getting ready our muffuletta puff pastry using the same method simply lay down the filling down the center and then we'll do the crisscross all the way down the entire loaf you can use a knife to trim off any excess pastry now with both our loafs on the pan we're going to brush it with a little bit of egg wash so give us that nice golden brown color and for a little extra flavor we'll put a little sprinkle of fresh grated Parmesan over the top now let's get it into the oven 375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes and oh my here it is fresh out of the oven for the muffuletta is on the left the pizza filling on the right doesn't that look outstanding now here's a great option for your filling use egg roll wrappers or wonton rods these are made from flour and eggs you can get them vegan without the eggs usually get 25 to 50 in a package and they're fun to work with so we'll lay one of our sheets over and down two sides we'll give it a little rush of egg wash we're gonna add our muffle lot of filling to it and we'll just simply fold it over and rub the edges together now also using a fork will help seal this once you pressed it down with your fingers use a fork and this will help seal the wonton wrapper I've had a lot of fun creating different fillings for these and you can bake them or deep-fry them today I'm baking them simply place it on parchment paper and a cookie sheet 350 degrees Fahrenheit 25 to 30 minutes and oh my look at this don't they look outstanding nice and golden-brown you can reheat them the next day they're delicious cold and they freeze well these are so versatile whether you're having it for a meal or an appetizer the wontons cut them in half so they're finger sized they're great rewarmed in the oven the next day and they're delicious cold same with the puff pastries cut them into strips finger size lay them out in a plate two different flavors muffuletta pizza whatever ones you come up with they're delicious well I hope you and your family get to try them out and don't forget to subscribe to my videos I put one out every Monday hit the little red subscribe button and
