hi lovelies so a few weeks ago I shared some of my very favorite homemade broth recipes and you guys seemed to really enjoy it but in the comments section I got a lot of questions about bone broth now bone broth is very trendy right now it's super high in protein really really healthy and it's really easy to make so I did some research and I've done some testing and today I'm sharing a great bone broth recipe with all of you now of course as the name suggests to make bone broth you need to start with some bones now I've seen this done with lots of different types of bones but the classic is made with beef bones so I found mine in my supermarket you can usually though just ask your butcher they'll definitely have some that they're trying to get rid of they're actually really inexpensive so that is not bad at all one important step when you were making a bone broth like this is roasting your bones now it's not essential in terms of getting a bone broth happening but it is going to help develop the best flavor so we're just going to arrange our bones on a baking sheet and then to amp up the flavor even more we are also going to roast our vegetables now this is an optional step but I think roasting vegetables definitely helps bring out the best flavors I'm going to add some leeks some carrot some celery some onion and some garlic as you can see I've chopped everything really roughly you don't have to be fussy about it all of this is going to be simmering for between 10 and 12 hours so just get them on the pan and get them into the oven and we'll just bake these for about 30 minutes or so we have developed a ton of flavor by roasting all of this beforehand now we can transfer it all to our slow cooker now you always have the option to do this in a soup pot but we are going to be simmering this for between 10 and 12 hours so slow cookers I think are the better tool for the job because you can kind of set them and forget them whereas leaving your stove on for that long kind of just makes me a little nervous so slow cooker in it to add even more flavor to my broth I'm going to throw in a big handful of fresh parsley I've got some fresh bay leaves I've also got some whole peppercorns I'm going to toss in here a good amount of salt and some water it should be said bone broth is considered a sipping broth so instead of cooking with it or using it in the soup recipe most people will actually just sip it hot as it is so you really do want to add as much flavor as you possibly it can because you are going to really taste it once we've got this all topped up with water we're just going to put our lid on and then set our heat to low and let this cook for between 10 and 12 hours yes it seems like a long time to wait but you have to remember the secret to the nutrition in bone broth is really slowly extracting all of the amazing nutrients and vitamins hidden within the bone 10 to 12 hours later your patience will be rewarded what you'll end up with is a nice savory rich broth I'm just going to finish this off with a few splashes of apple cider vinegar to add some much-needed acidity and then all you'll need to do is strain it at this point and skim the fat bones like this often render a lot of fat so you may find it easier to allow your breath to cool completely and then you can just really easily skim the fat off the top with a spoon totally up to you though once you've got that fat removed you can store this in the fridge for up to three days or in the freezer for up to three months and then just use it as you need it a bone Appetit I really hope you guys found this tutorial helpful and if you have any other questions about bone broth don't hesitate to leave them in the comment section below I will do my best to answer as many as I possibly can and of course if you give this a try it be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because you know I always love seeing your creations if you're looking for more great homemade broth recipes I've got a ton of them on the channel so take a look for those and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more deliciousness where this came from
