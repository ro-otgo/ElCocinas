[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete tomorrow we're heading down to our trailer on the Grand River we're getting together with some friends we're going golfing and then we're gonna do a potluck I'm putting together a nice pasta sauce it's gonna be filled with vegetables and I'm gonna put together a lovely meatball stuffed with mozzarella cheese let's get to our sauce first so in a large pot I'm starting out with a hundred ounces of San Marzano tomatoes some of the best tomatoes that you'll find you want to put these in and use your hands or a potato masher to mash them up a little bit you know what makes a magnificent sauce is doing it the day or two before and cooking it slowly once I put in all my ingredients here I'll cook it nice and slow two three four hours how much time do you have at least two hours but I'll let this sit on here all afternoon and that'll give me time to make my meatballs so to our Tomatoes we're gonna add a 13 ounce can of tomato paste now if you want to cut this down in half this recipe all you simply have to do is buy some smaller cans of tomatoes like these ones here there are 28 ounce just use two of these and divide all these ingredients by half next we're gonna put onions finely diced I have one white large onion one yellow bell pepper 1 green bell pepper finely diced I have eight cremini mushrooms chopped up here 1 zucchini zucchini is a great addition to any red sauce it would just absorb the flavors and carrots I've graded these carrots in a hand grater and they'll not only give you more veg more fiber but it will sweeten up the sauce oregano I've got 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning 3 tablespoons I've got 3 bay leaves a teaspoon or 2 teaspoons each of salt and pepper you can always season it more at the end I've got 3 finely diced cloves of garlic fresh from our garden yesterday and also fresh from our garden yesterday I have some fresh basil just finely chopped up beautiful aroma we'll mix that all up bring it to a little bit of a boil then let it simmer with the lid on we'll let it sit check on it every half an hour give it a stir and that's it let's get to our meatballs stuffed with mozzarella cheese so let's make our delicious meatballs to start off if you want a nice moist meatball I have three slices of cubed bread to that we're gonna add 2/3 a cup of milk we'll get those all nice and moist and wet and then we'll set these aside and we'll add them to all the rest of our spices and so on once they've softened up nicely next we're going to start off with the tablespoon and a half of garlic powder tablespoon and a half of onion powder two tablespoons of Italian seasoning 3/4 of a tablespoon of oregano 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper there's lots of salt and set in the parmesan that we're going to add and the ketchup that we're going to add so we don't need lots of salt to this I'm going to add two tablespoons of ketchup 1 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and our bed starting to look nice and wet now so we'll get that in there mix this up well I'm going to add some eggs three eggs I've got three pounds of lean ground beef going into this and the eggs help find our meatballs so in with my three well beaten eggs you know they're flavors all mixed well I find doing this prior to putting in your beef you get all the flavors mix nice and evenly it's not a real pretty slurry in there but it's gonna give us a nice moist meatball with terrific flavors looks like the bread is pretty well spread out nice and evenly now so now I'll add my three pounds of lean ground beef I'll mix this up real well I'll get my hands in here and the next we'll roll up some meatballs and stuff them with mozzarella cheese I have a pan ready for the oven that's lightly greased my mozzarella cheese is cut up into 1-inch cubes roll up ur meatball press an opening down for it your cheese put a cube in and roll it up it's that simple [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the sauce has been simmering for almost two hours now the last half hour or so I'll leave that top just slightly off just to get rid of some of the moisture and now it's time to get the meatballs in 400 degrees we want to brown these up nicely so we'll flip them halfway through want to make sure all the pink is gone in the center let's get them in the oven these are pretty big meatballs I left them in for 20 minutes I'm going to flip them now and get them back in another 15 or 20 and I think they'll be ready oh my I know that for tomorrow for the potluck but I got a try one with a little bit of my sauce there it is all plated up oh my that looks delicious time to try it out I mean balls and the sauce are all done I think it's gonna work out great tomorrow for a potluck down at the river but now I get to try the goods the mozzarella cheese you can see it just oozing out let's give it a whirl very juicy I have my sauce a little bit of my sauce in there little mushroom on the side Oh [Music] so
