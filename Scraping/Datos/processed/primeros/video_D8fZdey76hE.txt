hi lovelies I hope you're staying safe healthy and happy these days and I'm so glad you're here for another episode of my cook with me series where I'm sharing some of my very favorite quick and easy recipes that can be made with things you probably already have on hand in your pantry your refrigerator or your freezer now today it is all about this incredible smoky corn chowder this recipe actually comes from my cookbook meals made easy but it's been over a year since I have made it at home and I just found myself craving some recently because it's really the ultimate comfort food it's sweet its savory its smoky it's got a hint of spice which is totally optional and honestly it is one of those recipes that I come back to over and over and over again my pot is heating up over medium-high heat and to that I'm just going to get a little oil happening here now in my cookbook this recipe calls for a couple slices of bacon but I will just admit that I didn't have any bacon on hand at home so instead I am improvising with some turkey kielbasa it's got the same smoky savory flavor so it's going to work just as well you can see I cut it into really little bit if you have bacon go ahead and use it if not you can use any sort of smoked sausage that you want to or you can skip the meat in this recipe entirely and just keep it vegetarian it's totally up to you basically what I'm gonna do is get started by getting my Cabasa into the pan and once that Kobus is in the pan I'm just gonna let it cook away for two or three minutes I wanted to just start crisping up around the edges it gives it a really nice texture and of course it brings out even more of that great smoky flavor alright so as soon as you start to see a little bit of that browning happening around the edges of your kielbasa you can go ahead and get your veggies into the pot now today I'm using a combination of onion celery and some bell pepper if you can't find celery or bell pepper you can leave them out it is totally optional you want to make sure though that you've got some onion because of course when it comes to sea onion is always essential I'll let those veggies cook up just until they start to soften between three and four minutes and then I'm gonna go ahead and add some minced garlic to the pan as well as one minced Chipko play pepper now I have to tell you two potent a pepper is one of my very favourite ingredients because it's got a ton of great smoky flavor and also a little bit of spice I'm using one chipotle pepper in this recipe because I don't want it to be so spicy that L can't eat it she does actually enjoy a little bit of spice if you can believe it I've minced it really finely and I'm going to get it into the pan now if you find yourself without chipotle peppers for this recipe not to worry at all you could swap in some chipotle powder here or if you want the smoke without any spice you could use some smoked paprika instead any of those options will definitely work once I've got that yummyness in my pan I'm gonna let it cook up for another minute or so before I go ahead and add my corn to the pan now I am using frozen corn here because that's what I had on hand but you could definitely use canned corn in this recipe or even fresh corn if you can get your hands on some it would be really wonderful here I've also got a couple potatoes that I've just peeled and dice and I'm going to get those into my pot as well next I'm going to be adding some chicken broth to this as well as about a cup of milk Gregg is behind the camera right now holding it down making sure everything's in focus and I've been trying to get him to come in front of the camera and say hi event it's a no-go one day I'll get him around here so we're just hitting this with a little salt and pepper at this point I'll give this only good stir and then as soon as my liquid comes to a boil I'm going to go ahead and reduce my heat to medium-low pop a lid on this and let it simmer away for about 15 minutes or so or just until those potatoes are nice and tender after 15 minutes we can go ahead and thicken this soup up now to do that I am using a combination of corn starch mixed with a little bit of water this is called a corn starch slurry if you don't have corn starch on hand you can swap some flour in here instead that will definitely work adjust as well then I'm just going to stir that mixture into my soup and you'll notice in just 2 or 3 minutes it starts to thicken up and get this really a beautiful rich consistency and it's ready to be enjoyed I like serving it topped with a nice big dollop of sour cream that cuts through that spice a little bit and I also like topping it with some freshly chopped chives if you have some on hand if you're looking for something rich creamy and comforting this soup totally hits the spot plus it freezes really really well so you can go ahead and make a double batch and save a little for later how convenient guys I hope you'll give it a try for yourselves and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because you always know how much I love seeing your kitchen creations
