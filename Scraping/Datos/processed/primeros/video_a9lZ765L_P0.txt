hi lovelies we are celebrating the arrival of soup season with some of my all-time favorite soup recipes and when it comes to comfort food today's recipe is the very best it's my absolutely amazing creamy chicken and vegetable soup and it's full of good for you ingredients that your entire family will love now i don't know about you guys but in my house cold season has arrived with a vengeance my kids have been sick basically constantly since september so this soup has been on heavy rotation because it's really really comforting if you're not feeling well the best part is it's actually really really easy to make and you can do all of your prep during your sunday meal prep so come monday or tuesday night you can just throw it all in a pot and it's ready in less than 30 minutes what is not to love now of course this soup like most of my soups all starts with a nice big soup pot heating up on the stove if you don't have a nice big soup pot like this i highly recommend asking santa for one it's one of those kitchen tools i simply could not be without you should also keep in mind that while you can get these very expensive versions there's also much more affordable ones for example this one i think was less than fifty dollars i'll link a couple options in the description box below if you're interested in picking one up yourself so to my pot i'm gonna start by adding some butter so i've got this heating up over medium-high heat and i'm just going to let that butter melt down you don't want to use butter in this recipe it's totally fine a little olive oil or some vegetable or canola oil will totally work here but you guys know how i feel about butter right butter makes everything better come on especially when you're not feeling well you got to have the butter just as soon as that butter is melted i'm going to get in here with some onion some celery and some carrots all classic soup ingredients and i just want to let those cook away for maybe three or four minutes just until they start to soften up and you'll notice that celery turns nice and bright green in addition to all the sickness we've been battling in my house my sweet baby cold just turned eight months old and he's cutting all four of his top front teeth right now so there's been a lot going on we're a little sleep deprived and i like to think that this soup is extra comforting for him too oh yes he loves this soup as well all right just as soon as your veggies are nice and soft like mine are here we're gonna go ahead and add some garlic to this and with my garlic guys i am not holding back i've got two big cloves headed in here when you're talking about cold fighting soups you definitely want to add as much garlic as you can tolerate also it smells amazing in the pot we're just gonna let that garlic get nice and hot and bothered for another 30 seconds or so before we go ahead and add some flour to this i'm using flour in this recipe to give me a nice rich and creamy texture but what i want to do first is sort of cook off that floury flavor so i'm just going to let my flour cook up stirring it constantly for another minute or so then i'm gonna go ahead and add some potatoes to my pot adding potatoes to this soup makes it a lot more filling and hearty you know sometimes you have a bowl of soup and then you're hungry just an hour or two later the potatoes really help to sort of fill you up same thing with the chicken and the extra veggies that go in here so i've got two large potatoes cut into a nice small dice and i'm also going to be adding my broth at this point so i like using low-sodium chicken broth in this recipe but it's really up to you whatever kind of broth you like you could also do this with vegetable broth if you wanted to totally up to you depending on what you have on hand i'm also gonna go ahead and add my chicken to the pot so i'm using some boneless skinless chicken thighs here and i'm actually going to be adding them whole and then what i'll do is let them cook completely take them out and chop them if you wanted to do this with chicken breasts you totally could or if you had leftover cooked chicken you absolutely have the option to add that in here as well when it comes to seasoning this soup you really have the option to use any sort of dried herbs you want here but i like keeping things simple and classic with just a nice sprig of fresh thyme i find you get really really gorgeous flavor that way and at this point i'm just gonna pop a lid on my pot and bring this mixture to a boil just as soon as it's reached a boil you can reduce your heat to medium and let this cook away for maybe 10 or 15 minutes that's really all it takes for those potatoes to get nice and tender and that chicken to be fully cooked through all right friends it's been about 15 minutes and you can see lots of yummy things are happening here our chicken is fully cooked and so are those potatoes so now it's time to get our chicken out of the pot and we're gonna give it a rough chop before we get it back into the pot this is a really really quick technique that i use with pretty much all my chicken soup recipes now at the same time i'll remove my time spray as well we're going to pop the lid on this and let it keep cooking while we set to work on just chopping up this chicken quickly honestly it's so easy to do at this point because the chicken is nicely cooked all right now we're going to bring it all together so i've got my chicken all chopped up and it's going to go straight back into my pot watch for any splashback i really like to add lots of chicken to make this extra filling i'm also ready to add even more great veggies to this soup because i want it to be as nutritious as possible so i've opted for some broccoli florets that i've just cut into nice small pieces as well as some peas i'm using fresh but you could definitely use frozen in this recipe now the cool part about this is you can actually add any kind of greens you want here you could add some kale some spinach a little bit of asparagus or some green beans or even some snap peas or snow peas if you have those on hand i like adding them towards the end of cooking so they keep their nice bright green color and they don't get too mushy basically i'm just gonna let these cook for another two to three minutes just until my broccoli is tender and at this point i'm ready to finish this soup off i like to do it with a good splash of cream for added richness and a nice helping of salt and pepper to taste and honestly guys that's it how easy was that this soup is rich creamy satisfying and super nutritious which is why i absolutely adore it i hope your family loves it as much as mine does and that you'll give it a try
