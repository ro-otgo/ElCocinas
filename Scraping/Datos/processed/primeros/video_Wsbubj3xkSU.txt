[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete how many times do you get asked to bring an appetizer or you just feel like bringing something to pitch in stuffed mushroom calves I've put together some marvelous flavors follow this recipe your guests will be guaranteed to love it and come back for more let's get cookin to start off you'll need some crackers I chose the club crackers they have a buttery flavour and they're quite flaky whatever crackers you have on hand will do the trick now take 6 or 8 crackers place them into a ziploc bag using a meat tenderizer or a hammer or the bottom of a pot just top them gently until you get them to fine crumbs now for the stuffing we're going to start out with 1 cup of cream cheese 2 tablespoons of green onions 2 tablespoons of sun-dried tomatoes finely diced 2 slices of bacon finely chopped up 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning one teaspoon of granulated garlic powder and now I like to use some Creole seasoning I'm using Zadar aimes 1 tablespoon of that and then we'll put in 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese freshly grated and a half a cup of grated mozzarella cheese mix this thoroughly with a fork there'll be enough stuffing here for about 20 to 30 mushroom caps depending on the size of the mushrooms now I like to get as much stuffing as possible in my mushroom caps I use a teaspoon and you can flip the teaspoon upside down using the point of it you're able to push all that stuffing in all the empty crevices and simply flip your teaspoon over use all the excess on the teaspoon and smooth it out it's that simple and once they're all stuff you just gently press them into our cracker crumbs then we'll place them on our cookie sheet covered with parchment paper into the preheated oven 350 degrees for 30 minutes oh my there they are fresh out of the oven I like to serve them with a little bit of blue cheese for dipping talk about mouth-watering well that was another simple and delicious recipe if there's any recipes you'd like to see drop me a direct line or leave me a note right here on YouTube and don't forget you can subscribe to my videos because I put a new one out every Monday well I hope you enjoy these I hope you get to try them out with your friends I'm gonna try one right now the smell the aroma in here is beautiful Oh beautiful flavors the Creole seasoning the sun-dried tomatoes all those different cheeses I'm telling you your friends are gonna love it you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pea until next time see ya [Music] baby please over 10 [Music] you [Music]
