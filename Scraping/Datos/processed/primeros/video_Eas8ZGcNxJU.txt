[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete well I'm on my way and my annual trip from Ontario down to Florida and I always stop and visit my sister here in North Carolina well she's a little bit camera shy today but she's always willing to give up some of her fabulous recipes and today we're gonna make a cream of broccoli chowder she's been making it for years and now she's passing along to you it's delicious I know you're gonna love it let's get cooking so I'm using an 8 quart pot I'm gonna add 5 cups of diced up russet potatoes and we'll add 1 medium onion finely diced and 3 stalks of celery finely diced and 1 and 1/2 cups of shredded carrots and then we'll top that up with 10 cups of water we'll place our temperature on a high heat I'm going to cover it and bring it to a boil now I'll be using some chicken base this is great for flavoring your soups sauces and gravies I'm gonna add 1/2 a cup of this chicken base you can put more to taste as you go we'll place the lid back on it and let it simmer for 20 minutes on a low temperature now we'll add 2 cans of corn and 1 liter or one quart of room temperature 1/2 and 1/2 cream we want it room temperature so it doesn't curdle and slowly stir it in now we'll add 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of pepper cover it and simmer for another 30 minutes now it's time to make this soup into a chowder in a bowl I've mixed 1/3 cup of corn starch with a half a cup of water mix that up well and add it slowly to our soup and that'll help thicken it up cover and let simmer for another 20 minutes remember to stir occasionally so it doesn't stick to the bottom I will add our 2 pounds of frozen broccoli florets now cover and let simmer until the broccoli is tender about 30 to 40 minutes oh my look at how rich and thick it is it looks so delicious I think I better find somebody to join me in tasting this lovely broccoli chowder well that was another simple and delicious recipe and to try the goods with me as my lovely niece Gianna affectionately known as Gigi well I think it's time for us to try the goods grandma makes the best doesn't she and speaking of grandma here's my sister PJ thank you very much well what do you say we try the goods how about some oyster crackers on there do you like those all right let's try the goods oh my lots of vegetables nice and creamy any good grandma she has the best recipes well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music] [Music]
