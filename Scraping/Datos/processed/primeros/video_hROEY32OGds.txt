[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with pete today my latest creation cajun pimento cheese balls they're delicious they're outstanding you're gonna love them let's get to it let's start out with our sweet potatoes using a fork just pierce all the sides now this recipe will cook approximately 30 to 40 cheese balls and you can freeze them as well once they're pierced place them in a pan into the oven 425 for about 45 minutes on the top shelf of a barbecue works just as well while the potatoes are cooking we'll put together a nice dipping sauce we'll need one clove of garlic sliced up one tablespoon of brown sugar a half a cup of your favorite mayonnaise a half a cup of sour cream one to two teaspoons of your favorite hot sauce and one teaspoon of cajun seasoning i like to use slap yuma we just put all those ingredients inside a blender and whip them up until it becomes a nice creamy sauce hmm that's delicious we'll just let that chill out in the fridge now our potatoes have cooled and now i'm going to remove the skins they just simply fall out when you give them a little squeeze and then chop them up with a nice sharp knife and then we'll add our ingredients for our filling to the cheese balls we'll need 2 cups of medium cheddar cheese [Music] 1 cup of herb and garlic cream cheese [Music] one cup of diced pimentos one teaspoon of slap your mama or your favorite cajun seasoning [Music] using a spoon mix it well till it comes to a nice creamy mixture now give it a taste for salt and if you think it needs it add a little bit at this time you have three options now cool it for 30 minutes and then make your cheese balls or make them the day after just leave them in the fridge or you can freeze them for another day now let's get to our coating we have our filling and we have some italian seasoned panko bread crumbs but i like to add a little more seasoning to that a half a teaspoon of granulated garlic powder give that a good mix we also need 3 eggs well beaten you may need to add more as we go simply place a small spoonful in your hands and roll it up into a ball first into the egg wash and then into the dry bread crumbs now we're going to be coating this twice so once it's coated thoroughly we'll do the same process into the egg wash and then back into the panko breadcrumbs ensure that it's nicely coated and then place them on a plate and continue on [Music] heat your oil to 350 degrees place the cheese balls in the oil and they cook very quickly it only takes about one minute on each side until they are nice golden brown you can see i'm using two forks you just have to roll them once to get the other side nice and golden brown onto a paper towel to let them drain and then sprinkle them with a little bit of salt that's it we had an appetizer party recently at our trailer park and this is how i served them up i placed two of the cheese balls on each plate cut them in half with a little serving of that delicious dipping sauce oh my cajun pimento cheese balls you're gonna love them and folks don't forget to subscribe to my videos i put one out every monday just hit that little red subscribe button and you'll get notified well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pete until next time see ya baby please don't pretend
