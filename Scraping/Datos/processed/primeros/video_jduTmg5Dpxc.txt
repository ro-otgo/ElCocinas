[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today we're doing a simple and delicious recipe I created it's a beef and cheese stuffed pastry so delicious so easy I use the already made puff pastry it leaves me so much time to do some of the things like creating recipes some of my passions in cooking are creating sauces and fillings and different recipes with herbs and spices that's the things that I love to do and when I use the puff pastry that's already done it frees up a lot of time let's get cooking we'll start off with the stuffing that I've created and it all started out because I had some leftover roast beef let's get to it first we'll start out with four to five cremini mushrooms and we'll finely dice them just run your knife through them a couple of times and the same with an onion we're gonna need book three tablespoons finely diced now in a pan on a medium to high heat we're gonna add a teaspoon of each butter and olive oil we'll saute our mushrooms and onions till they're golden brown and just before we take them off add a little pinch of salt and pepper give it a stir then we'll remove them and set them aside when I first created this recipe it was from leftovers of a sirloin roast and that's what I'm using here just finely dice it and at the end we want to end up with 2 cups finely dice roll speed a mixing bowl we'll add our two cups of diced roast beef and then we'll add one cup of urban garlic cream cheese three tablespoons of mayonnaise or blue cheese dressing is a good option two cups of grated cheese I used the Italian mix three teaspoons of or Siraj more or less to your taste but I think horseradish and roast beef just go together so well it's kind of like grilled cheese and ketchup it's a perfect match last ingredient is our mushrooms and onions that we have sauteed we'll sprinkle those in we want to mix this thoroughly we'll set that in the fridge for a few minutes and let's get over to our pastry you'll find these puff pastries in the freezer section I've let it thaw overnight and you can see there's two per box I'm gonna take one out and just open it up and unravel it and you can see it's a nice flat pastry about ten inches by 10 inches I want to roll this out and get an extra inch or two on each side you want to put some flour down on the surface blue flower in my hands the flour on top of the pastry and a little flour on my roller and just gently roll out each side so eventually I get about an extra 2 inches it'll end up about 12 by 12 now using a sharp paring knife I'm going to put little slits down each side about an inch and a half from each other as you can see I'm not touching the center as that's where we're gonna put our filling of taking my filling out of the fridge and split it in half this recipe is perfect for two of these sheets just simply lay it out in between and now you're gonna start doing the fancy pastry work fold up each end and then you're just going to crisscross all the way down that's how it ends up looking so beautiful after its baked at the end if there's a little excess just simply cut it off with the paring knife now we'll do the same with our second one look at that just enough filling for two sheets fold it up and then it'll be time to put it on a cookie sheet and some parchment paper I'm gonna use some egg wash just an egg all mixed up and brush it on top that's gonna give us a nice golden brown and a little sprinkle of salt and pepper that'll do it we'll put that into a preheated 375-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes and here it is fresh out of the oven nice and golden-brown this recipe is not only great just for a nice sit-down dinner but how about a little appetizer party cut them up into single servings oh my doesn't that look mouth-watering you another simple and delicious recipe if you enjoyed it give me a thumbs up I appreciate it boy oh boy it looks good I think I'm gonna give it a whirl it just oozes out all that filling nice flaky pastry oh man but be so tender and cheesy when that flaky pastry that's outstanding I've got some great ideas for some different fillings that you're gonna see on future episodes of in the kitchen with Pete so don't forget to subscribe I put on a new video every Monday just hit that little subscribe button and you'll get notified well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music] [Music] baby please don't pretend [Music] you [Music]
