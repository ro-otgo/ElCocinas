hello friends and welcome back to my channel so today is going to be a really fun video monkey's actually having all of his best guy friends over and they are doing their fantasy football drafts so i know he's very excited and we are going to grill out smash burgers later but while they do their draft i thought it'd be fun to make some little snacks for them so i'm going to share three very simple very easy few ingredient appetizer recipes with y'all [Music] what is this what [Music] who's going to be your number one draft pick um monkey by the time they see this you've already done it no i'm saying you should know oh it depends on what draft slot i get if i have the first pick it's going to be a certain person if i have the 10th pick it's going to be a different person who do you want first that's impossible to answer it depends on what draft position oh my goodness gracious these are trick these are loaded questions okay they say y'all tell us down below in the comments if your husband gets as excited as mr b does about his fancy football team it's draft day baby okay so for this first recipe all you're gonna need is three ingredients and i think these are gonna be so good so they're gonna be little everything but the bagel kielbasa bites so you're gonna need one package of kielbasa you're gonna need some crescent rolls and then of course some everything but the bagel seasoning i'm going to go ahead and roll this out and then we will get our kielbasa wrapped up in it [Music] okay so we're just gonna have this i'm gonna take my first one which would be like um four individual little crescents and i'm just gonna kind of like spread it out and pinch these seams together okay so place one part of your little kielbasa on there and just wrap this up and now we're just going to sprinkle our everything with the bagel seasoning on here so you want to coat all sides but this stuff is very powerful so don't use too much oh no you can overdo it you can always knock that stuff off of there you know if you got too much yeah kind of press it in there so it gets like down in the dough sorry sometimes i just get so excited to watch what's actually happening that you forget you're filming is that good you think yeah that's that's that's pretty good coverage there okay okay so now you're gonna take this and you're just gonna cut like little bites you want them to be about an inch thick [Music] so this is kind of like pigs in a blanket but more grown-up style [Music] that looks like a lot of pig to blanket [Music] okay now i gotta do our other kabasa and then you're gonna take the rest of your crescent roll which should be the exact same amount roll it out and do the exact same process [Music] quite the delight yes this is almost something i would really maybe even want to just eat for breakfast right yeah actually there's lots of ways you can make this or like different seasonings but the area of the bagel is gonna be so good okay so now these are going into the oven at 350 for like nine to 12 minutes and that is it these are the most simple little bites ever and also i was going to say the key to this is once they come out you want to let them like cool completely so give them about 10 minutes and that way the bread like adheres to that sausage really well it doesn't come like unraveled okay so this next recipe is my favorite and i've made this one other time it was quite a while ago and i'm not kidding when i tell y'all i think about this recipe all the time and i have not made it ever since so i cannot wait for this i'm going to like crash whole fancy football party so i can have some of this and this one is only four ingredients and also only going to take about 10 minutes so simple you know when you uh made this last it was for football something no no it was new year's eve oh yes new year's eve okay but not this year was the year before so we are doing our little like biscuit gorgonzola pull apart bread oh my gosh so good so you'll need some gorgonzola cheese you can also use blue cheese if you want to the gorgonzola is just a little bit milder so you'll need one container of that you're also going to need some garlic and then about half a stick of butter i'm going to go ahead and melt this and then we're going to add some garlic to it and we're going to cut up our biscuits into like little cubes and roll these around in the garlic butter i was going to say i'm really excited about those kielbasa things you really are i'm so glad i know this is good but like that i'm really excited for [Music] okay so to my melted butter i'm gonna add in a good amount of garlic you can kind of add in however much you want and then we are going to let's do a little bit more old juice and then we're just going to pour this all over top of these um biscuits and kind of toss them that way they're just like really evenly coated yeah i want i want butter all over them biscuits butter on the biscuits i feel like it helps them pull apart better too i think so too so give these a good toss [Music] my goodness it's gonna be so good i think there's so many recipes that you can make with biscuit though just from a can we can okay now to this we're just going to top it with our gorgonzola cheese look it's kitty so next we're just going to pop these into the oven at 375 and they take about 20 to 30 minutes so just keep an eye out until they are nice and golden brown these just came out and they look so good so i'm going to let them rest for about 10 minutes [Music] oh my god they're really so good this is amazing oh yeah it's so easy i guess you probably have to have a preference for everything bagel seasoning but if you do it's really good good does this not look amazing it is one of my all-time favorite appetizers y'all have to try this one okay so before we get started on this third recipe i want to take a second and thank cara for sponsoring today's video you guys know i love my pair of vitamins

out got my nails done what else did i do stopped in the target you know all the usual things and we are leaving this morning for tennessee so my straightener and my curling iron is already packed so ignore my poofy hair but we decided we still wanted to make these little pizza bombs that i'm about to make because we don't really want to have to stop on our way to tennessee so we thought these would actually be perfect for our little road trip they're like handheld bunking can eat them while he's driving the camper so bunkie used to have these whenever he was a little kid this is bunky's um i don't see his recipe but he requested this yeah now the only thing is i really don't quite we both don't quite know what kind of bread his mom used yeah we called her and she said parker style rolls so we have the sister schubert parker house style rolls we have let them thaw they were frozen i have crescent rolls on backup just in case these go south oh no but all you're gonna need is some yeast rolls some mozzarella and some pepperoni so again only three ingredients so simple and they shouldn't take long at all all right sister let's see what you got love that we just are not sure this is the right thing oh i feel like we were these are supposed to be more like a uh like a yeast roll like salt this this can't be right yeah but look you can kind of smush it down no i don't think so bae okay y'all these are still very tasty maybe we should just cook these i'm getting the crescent rolls out get the crescent rolls out babe sister schubert we still love you okay so now we're just gonna put our little pepperonis and mozzarella cheese in our crescent roll i'm gonna dust them lightly with a little bit of melted butter parmesan and some italian seasoning on top oh honey you have you know what i realized though that we won't have i guess we could kind of heat it up a little side of marinara to dip them in yeah if we just put it in a container yeah container now set it on the dashboard that sun will just you know that little that little spot the little tray on the dash yeah that thing is like a i mean you don't ever i'm sure people know this but you put anything that's metal up in that thing and then grab it it's hot you already got a little oven yeah [Music] we like always had a little bag of pepperonis in our refrigerator bee's been telling me these little uh pizza bites or pizza bombs whatever you want to call them are like gonna take him back to his child they already have the memories they're flooding back [Music] okay monkey wants four pepperonis per roll so i'm just kind of like staggering them yeah they can the pepperoni i feel like can kind of be out the edge a little bit yeah the cheese though we want to stay in there because yes we don't want that leaking out on us [Music] sister schubert donkey listen here buddy now how am i gonna roll this up with this stretch i got you we'll just let's get all the cheese a little more centralized here and then we're gonna tuck look at this technique where did i roll up that one i was rolling up the uh enchiladas oh yeah yeah yeah loosely we want a loose roll there we are okay look at that little guy huh well you know what you just earned yourself a job i did not i'ma let you finish [Music] funky what is this what is this what what is this oh my goodness are they taking your thing are they taking spaghetti pie from you are they trying they try this is an insult [Music] i like to be very gentle with the crescent rolls you know because i like them to get i like the fluffy puffiness i feel like if you press and smush them too much they get uh they don't rise and get as you know airy and flaky as one would like right okay popping these into the oven at 350 for like 12 to 14 minutes i almost forgot our parmesan and italian seasoning so i'm just gonna actually spray the tops of these lightly with some parquet [Music] okay these look so good they were in there for probably about 14 to 15 minutes but they are going to be delicious i know somebody that is very excited about them that looks real yummy you touch them i you know i think they might need to go back in there for a few more minutes because i like mine overcooked i like them nice and brown okay monkey likes his overcooked so i'm gonna actually stick these back in here for just like two more minutes but if you like yours soft and fluffy just do it for like the 14 to 15. all right y'all so that's gonna do it for this video i hope you enjoyed making these little appetizers with me if you try any of them let me
