more excited guys soup day in our studio is one of the best days of the year today I'm starting with an incredible herbed chicken and rice soup and of course it's really delicious and it's got a ton of classic comforting flavors now I'm just gonna get started by heating up some oil in a nice big soup pot like this if you don't have a soup pot like this I always recommend investing in one it is by far one of my favorite things to splurge on in the kitchen if you're looking for one similar to this I will link a few options in the description box below they're really really great to have in the kitchen and they last forever as soon as that oil is nice and hot I'm going to get my chicken into the pot today I'm using some boneless skinless chicken thighs that I've cut into cubes you could swap in some breasts here if you wanted to or if you wanted to make this job even easier you could use a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket or even some leftover chicken you've got options is what I'm saying I'll season my chicken up with a little salt and a little pepper and cook it until it's nice and browned on all sides because our chicken is cut into nice small pieces it takes no time to cook up and then you can get your veggies into the pot so I am adding an onion some celery and some carrot in this recipe all three are must-haves as far as I'm concerned in the chicken soup recipe and I'm just going to let those cook up with my chicken for maybe another two to three minutes I want to just give them a quick to soften up once your celery has turned nice and bright green that means it's time to go for it with even more great flavour I've got some garlic headed in here as well as some fresh thyme fresh thyme is just so essential in a classic chicken soup recipe I can't live without it I'll let my garlic and thyme cook up for another 30 seconds or so to reach their maximum flavor potential then I'm going to add my rice to the pan as well as a nice splash of white wine now the white wine in a recipe like this is absolutely optional you could just skip to adding your chicken broth here and that would be fine but I think it adds really wonderful flavor and it should only take a minute or two of cooking to get the alcohol to evaporate out of your wine and then you can go ahead and add your broth to the pot as well as one bay leaf I'm using a dried bay leaf today but fresh would definitely work in this recipe one important thing to note in this recipe is that it's important to use a lot of chicken broth because of course our rice is going to absorb a ton of it during the cooking process and if you don't use enough chicken broth you're basically going to end up with cooked rice but not actually soup so go ahead and use quite a bit of chicken broth we're gonna bring this mixture to a boil and as soon as it reached a boil we will reduce our heat to medium-low pop the lid on it and let it cook away for say 10 to 15 minutes you want to make sure that your rice is fully cooked and nice and tender then we'll just remove our bay leaf from the pot because I'll be honest it's not all that delicious to eat on its own and we're going to stir in some freshly chopped parsley at this point this yumminess is ready to be enjoyed I guarantee you this will become a family favorite for years to come the best part is it reheats beautifully the next day so you can take it for lunch or a second dinner totally up to you next guys for something a little bit different but unbelievably delicious we're making chicken alfredo soup yeah it's soup that tastes like chicken alfredo pasta and oh my gosh it's unbelievable tasting but really easy to prepare it all starts once again with my nice big soup pot I've got a little bit of oil heating up and to that I'm going to add my chicken in this case I'm using chicken breasts but once again you can use what what kind of chicken that you want I'll season that chicken with some salt and some pepper and let it cook until it's nice and browned on all sides next I'm going to add some onion to my pot and as soon as my onions nice and soft I'll add some garlic to the pot as well after about 30 seconds or so you'll be able to smell that amazing garlic aroma and that means it's time to add a little bit of flour to my pot now the flour is going to help this soup get a bit of a creamier thicker consistency but we want to make sure to cook off that floury taste first so I'm going to cook my flour for about a minute but you want to make sure that you're stirring it constantly because otherwise it does tend to burn next I'll get my chicken broth into the pot as well as a good splash of cream now this recipe will work with both milk or cream cream is obviously going to make it a little bit richer milk will make it a little lighter it's totally up to you what your preference is we want to bring this mixture just to a simmer keep a close eye on it because of course anything with milk tends to Scholz really easily and as soon as it's simmering I'm going to reduce my heat to medium and add my pasta to this now because this is a chicken alfredo it felt right to add some pasta I'm actually using some fresh cheese tortellini that I found in the deli aisle at my supermarket you could use beef or chicken tortellini here as well both would work but I find cheese tortellini is perfect with the rest of the flavors in this dish the great part is because we're using fresh pasta in this recipe it takes almost no time to cook usually your tortellini will be cooked between 4 and 5 minutes then we can go ahead and stir in our greens in this recipe today I'm using some baby spinach but some kale would work here as well of course it would not be alfredo without some freshly grated Parmesan so we shouldn't be alfredo using too much and I'm going to wrap things up with some freshly chopped parsley we'll give it a quick stir and it is ready to be devoured and I will just tell you devoured is the only way for this soup to be eaten in fact it was basically gone almost as soon as we were done shooting it finally if you're looking for a soup that's rich warm smoky and spicy then this chicken tortilla soup is definitely it for you it does have a ton of ingredients but don't be intimidated by that they're actually all really simple you have most of in your pantry already and I would say some of them are optional I'm using a lot of spice in this one to get really maximum flavor but you could use something as simple as a little chili powder and this would still be really really tasty I've got a little bit of oil heating up and to that I'm going to add my chicken I've got it seasoned with a little salt and a little pepper for flavor as soon as my chicken is brown I'm going to add some onion and some red bell pepper to my pot and let that cook up for another three to four minutes just to tell they're tender then I'm going to add some minced garlic and some jalapeno to my pot you can skip the jalapeno if spice isn't your thing but if you do love the heat I recommend absolutely going for it here I'm also going to add a little bit of tomato paste to this the reason I love tomato paste in my cooking is because it's got a ton of great concentrated tomato paste flavor speaking of flavor of course a chicken tortilla soup is all about the spices so I'm using a combination of chili powder I've got some dried oregano I've got some cumin some coriander and I'm even adding just a little hit of chipotle powder now I'll be honest I had all of these great spices just hanging out in my pantry so I went for it but if you're missing any one place it's not gonna make or break your soup you really just need chili powder and the rest is just for extra flavor I like giving those spices a minute or two to heat up in the pan stirring them constantly heating them up like this really maximizes their flavor potential then to my pot I'm gonna go ahead and add some canned black beans that I've drained and rinsed I've got some corn some diced tomatoes as well as some chicken broth headed in here then it's just a matter of bringing this yumminess to avoid and as soon as it boils I can reduce my heat to medium and let this simmer away for between 15 and 20 minutes the good part about a soup like this is that it doesn't take long to become excellent if you wanted to let it simmer for longer say an hour you definitely could but it's not absolutely essential while that soup is simmering away we have time to work on our tortilla topping of course it's chicken tortilla soup what would chicken tortilla soup be without some crunchy tortillas on top now if you wanted to keep things simple with a little supermarket shortcut here you could use some store-bought tortilla chips but of course I like going extra mile we're basically just taking a few corn tortillas and I'm gonna cut them into thin strips and then I'm going to arrange them on a baking sheet toss them in a little bit of oil some garlic powder a little salt and then we'll just give them a toss so everything's coated evenly and get them into the oven at 350 degrees for say ten to twelve minutes or just until they are completely crisp I know buying tortilla chips is easier but you won't believe how great the flavor and texture is on these chips now that our soup is ready we can finish it off with a good squeeze of fresh lime juice some salt and some pepper and it is ready to be enjoyed piled high with those amazing tortillas what is not to love guys chicken soup three delicious ways I hope you will give all
