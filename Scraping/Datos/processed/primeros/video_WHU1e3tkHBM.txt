hello friends and welcome back to my kitchen so today i've got three awesome and delicious recipes to share with y'all they're gonna be so easy and all three of these recipes have one common ingredient so we're making all of them with crescent roll dough this should be called him and cheese magic [Music] this is a special performance she has no idea what i'm about to do i have no clue if you like inchi ladas [Music] all right so we're gonna actually start with lunch because it is lunch time and monkey and i are so hungry after we make lunch we'll make our little it could be breakfast or dessert we're gonna call it dessert today and then tonight we'll make our dinner which is gonna be so good but for lunch i am the most excited because you all know how much i love my little hawaiian ham and cheese sandwiches y'all know i make them like all the time and they are the best well whenever i was thinking of like recipes for this video i was going obviously to buy my crescent rolls and i saw that they have the sweet hawaiian ones and i was like we're gonna make the ham and cheese sandwiches but in the crescent rolls we're gonna do like a big um like ham and cheese crescent roll ring and then we're gonna put our cheese in there i'm gonna like top it with garlic and ranch seasoning melted butter we're gonna make our little um whole grain mustard mayonnaise mixture to dip it in like y'all they're gonna be so good so first things first we need two rolls of the sweet hawaiian crescent rolls and we're just gonna layer them around um in a circle and kind of lay them on top so we have like a really good base and then we'll fill them with all the goodness and i always get questions about our pizza stone anytime we use it it is obviously very old and very used and loved um but it is a pampered chef pizza stone [Music] okay so two rolls was like the perfect amount so we have our ring put together and then over here i just got some um boar's head ham that we love sliced in the deli and i got about half a pound and i got it kind of thin like not shaved but not sandwich slice and then we have some baby swiss we're going to put on there and i'm going to go ahead and start up some of this colby jack so we'll lay this twist down then our ham and then we'll top it with some colby jack [Music] okay so now that everything is in there you're just gonna take your little tails of your crescent roll and just kind of pull it over and then you can kind of take what's left and tuck it over here to the side [Music] now to my melted butter i'm going to add in just a little bit of ranch seasoning and then a little bit of garlic powder we will stir that together and then i'm just going to lightly brush that all the way around the top [Music] okay so now into the oven at 375 for probably about 15 to 20 minutes but once it comes out i'll tell you the exact time it took [Music] those sandwiches smell so good y'all i cannot wait they only have about a minute left i'm going to go ahead and make our little condiment that we're going to dip them in so we're going to use a little bit of mayo stone ground mustard and i do recommend the stone ground mustard all those little mustard seeds in there that pop oh my gosh it's my favorite and then just a little splash of worcestershire and a little small sprinkle of ranch seasoning a little more sprinkle of ranch seasoning okay so we've got some mayo [Music] stone ground mustard beautiful this is actually i don't even think open that's new oh i love a good fresh brand new stone ground mustard oh me too doesn't that doesn't that just it's just beautiful it's just beautiful when it comes out i mean that's just the goodness is that your belly rumbling yeah i'm hungry oh my goodness could you hear that i wonder if you'll be able to hear that yeah okay a little splash of worcestershire and some ranch okay give this a little stir might need just another dash or two of the whoosh bunky i know you're gonna say it you see it every single time well it looks a little it looks a little thick you know oh thick you wanna taste it [Music] they look perfect oh my goodness monkey [Music] anticipation is killing me this might be one of your best lunches ever it stands a chance to be right up there in the top five and i'm so interested to see how i like this versus using the king's hawaiian rolls are they um they're sweet hawaiian sweet hawaiian crescent rolls yes i'm liking i'm liking what we got going on here boo i'm liking it okay i can't hardly stand to let this thing cool off i think we gotta let it sit for at least like two more minutes oh my goodness okay are we ready i'm ready let me just have where i want to go in let's go in over here [Music] and do you want like us oh no no come on now you want me to go all the way over here yes please trying to give me one little i was basically pressing around i was going to cut more than one dude see you don't have to come out club again right yeah oh my gosh he's gonna be so good we have our little dipping sauce this is so nice and fancy this is like ham and cheese delight right here that's what we should call this this is ham and cheese delight that is the new name for this okay oh my goodness let me get closer to you and see this thing let's do a little wow y'all look at that there there are no words did you dip yours i haven't dipped it yet i'm just impressed with how well this like holds together and all that you know [Music] friends this should be called ham and cheese magic it's ham and cheese delights though i know monkey but this is like magnificently delightfully incredibly tasty so do you think this is better i almost than the rolls i almost like it better because that crescent roll is like so flaky and just like melts in your mouth yeah oh my gosh i like it i love it get a little pickle here refresh the palette this is so good oh man okay i'm going to clean up finish eating and then we will get started on our second recipe okay so before we jump into this second recipe i do want to take a quick minute and thank ruggable for sponsoring today's video y'all i am in love with my new rug the colors in there match our chairs in the sunroom so perfect it looks amazing and i'm so thankful that my ruggable is washable because i already spilled my coffee on there so let me show you how easy the assembly is because it has like the non-slip grip pad that you lay down and then you literally can just place your rug on top it pulls up so easily to wash thank goodness so let me show it to you it is so beautiful and tell you a little bit more about ruggable so i have the cameron ivory opal rug in the 6x9 and y'all it is seriously stunning it is such a beautiful rug and something that i love about ruggable is that all of their rug covers are interchangeable they are super easy to swap out whenever you want and they don't slip they stay very secure right in place because you have that non-slip rug pad which is awesome and that rug pad is actually made from 95 recyclable material i was so upset whenever i spilled my coffee but thank goodness my rug cover is machine washable it's spill and stain resistant and it's safe for babies your pets even your clumsy husbands or you if you're clumsy like i am and what i love about it is that it is so lightweight y'all pulling this thing up was a breeze i could easily just put it in the washing machine and in the dryer it comes out just perfect no coffee stain all is well so that's the tea or coffee i should say oh my ruggable is everyone's favorite rug so be sure you head down to my description box click that link and use my promo code to save 10 off your purchase with ruggable okay so now let's get started on this next recipe so of course you will need some crescent rolls some pecans you don't have to put these in there but i think the crunch will be really nice you'll also need just a little bit of brown sugar and some apple pie spice you will also need a granny smith apple and then one more ingredient that is also optional is some caramel drizzle this one is a salted caramel which oh my gosh it's so good i think i'm going to drizzle this on top once they come out of the oven but these are going to be super simple to make a great little breakfast or dessert they're going to be so delicious [Music] okay so to get started on our little apple pie bites i just have some melted butter right here and i'm gonna toss my sliced apples into the melted butter and just kind of stir those around until they're nice and coated [Music] and then next i'm going to take my brown sugar i'm going to add a little bit of my apple spice to this and give it a good stir [Music] [Music] okay so now i'm taking my brown sugar and apple pie spice mixture i'm just going to sprinkle this right on top of each one [Music] then we're going to take our chopped pecans and just sprinkle a few of those on as well [Music] okay so once you have them wrapped up you're going to take your leftover melted butter you're going to brush this on the top and then we're going to sprinkle them with a little bit more of that apple pie spice [Music] okay into the oven at 375 for about 10 to 12 minutes [Music] okay and for the best part this caramel drizzle oh my gosh these are going to be amazing and i even have some cookie dough ice cream because why not i mean that looks like a dessert i want to eat i know you want a bite of that like right now hand it on over babe hand it on over i'm gonna let you get a bite first but then i want to bite you i can feel the warmth under in my on my hand under the plate yes handheld little baked apple pie bites yeah oh well i'm liking the texture so far [Music] wow that's really good i'm gonna get into the center here okay and then take a little bite with some ice cream yeah we didn't have any vanilla so i felt like the chocolate chip cookie dough would be just fine i ate all of the vanilla ice cream actually i figured this probably won't hurt anything though yep it's delicious good yeah this is good and y'all these are so simple to make okay so we are back in the kitchen it's actually the next day monkey and i are having another amazing lunch if you hear daisy may she's over here begging for some chicken and some cheese but we are gonna make the easiest most yummiest little chicken enchiladas using our crescent rolls we ended up having um frozen chicken nuggets and french fries for dinner last night we were trying to clean our house and do all this stuff and so we ended up not having time to cook my little makeshift chick-fil-a was good air the air fryer came to the rescue yeah it was actually a really good dinner it was very good dinner wasn't it yeah i loved it yes so but we're gonna have a really yummy lunch so let me show you how we're going to assemble these so i already have all of my chicken cut up and i just used a rotisserie chicken to make it even more simple and then i have some shredded sharp cheddar cheese here and i have a little bit of this colby jack that we used yesterday so i'll just kind of combine the two you're gonna need one can of crescent rolls a little bit of enchilada sauce and then i'm also going to add some little green chilies to ours you don't have to use these but i think it'll give like a little bit of extra flavor in there so i'm going to go ahead and get my chicken in our bowl top it with our cheese enchilada sauce and chili's and then give that a good stir [Music] okay so we've got this all mixed together and you do want to save just a little bit of your enchilada sauce because we're going to top it with that after it comes out of the oven now we're going to take our crescent rolls and we are going to make four rectangles out of them so you'll lay them out half it and then half each half again perforations are so helpful so helpful and then you're just going to take this so then we'll just kind of pinch these little seams together [Music] okay now to each of our little rectangles we're just going to add as much filling as you can get in there without stuffing it too full because we're going to roll them up just like enchiladas now which way are you rolling these things i don't know what should i do well i don't think it's going to roll up the way you oh my heavens is this too much yeah come on now let's try but which way do you roll it oh is that kind of stretch it a little smush you see oh yeah this will be just fine and then stretch it a little and seal the deal seal the dill see it's gonna be just fine perfect now put this in our baking dish and do the other three i was going to say two you could also put like all black olives in here if you wanted to or even um like some ratel if you drained it you can kind of add in here whatever you like you all know i'm like kid friendly recipes over here i was actually thinking and liking just using a can of patel instead of like green chilies because that's got you a little tomato like all the all the good flavor in there i almost used a can of um or a tail but then i realized we had this green chili so i was like might as well use those um but you can kind of add whatever you like in your chicken enchiladas into the mixture i wasn't thinking that things were gonna uh you're doubting me i'd yeah you always are doubting maybe prove me wrong prove me wrong i always prove you wrong but the way that these come out of the oven prove me wrong wow you you've really gotten the hang of this now oh yeah i've lost my job as the uh crescent roll person okay last one you know i twisted the pumpkin oh yeah you did you did so good i did the pumpkin twisting and i'm stuffing these things like pretty full we're gonna take this pop it in the oven at 375 for like 20 minutes then we're going to take them out sprinkle some cheese put them back in there for a couple minutes take them out and then just drizzle some more enchilada sauce and then put them back in no that's it or you'll put it back in i think i won't put them back in just like for a minute it's going to warm up kind of you know yeah do its thing in there this is like a very easy dinner recipe like if you have a night really busy and you need to get dinner on the table quick this is so simple especially using the rotisserie chicken the prep time is minimal yes [Music] okay what you're thinking it looks yummy doesn't it does look very yummy it looks so good and i left them in just a few extra minutes to make sure they were very well done for you i can tell i'm really liking this uh your little crust yeah that's looking good there yes okay i cannot wait green chili poking out over here yes [Music] i honestly can't wait for the sour cream yeah let's try it with all this sauce i just smell a little bite real fast how about sour cream first store what do you say boo that is good for real like you don't so you don't get regular enchiladas when we go out to eat not much never so is this gonna this is very good there's a little bit of heat in there it'll surprise you that green chili is the green chili i think that that that green chicken enchilada salt is like a little bit spicy too yes yeah well dip that is really good it's delicious i'm kind of shocked i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of shocked i was very suspect of the crescent roll giving me what i needed as far as that but it's almost like it's it's more you know what it kind of reminds me of what chimichanga oh yes yes i can see that you know the good old deep fried and yes this is delish i gotta tell you okay tell me are you ready yeah all right this is a special performance okay okay she has no idea what i'm about to do i have no clue all right i thought of this a little bit ago all right here goes [Music] i can't are you ready okay ready i'm ready if you like enchiladas and eating cheese every day if you like having a good time [Music] oh no no if you like hanging with the bonkies then just push play oh my gosh this is the best thing ever yeah i'm a little embarrassed you came up with this yeah i did actually yeah i'm a little my face is probably super real your face is beat red yeah buddy this is beautiful i actually have like you know how when you like get real nervous you kind of lose feeling in your legs that that has even happened but i just wanted everybody out there to enjoy that we enjoyed it so much thank you so much yeah so oh that is so funny i'm not known for my singing but uh i can't knock the love and i'm crying over here i mean you know if you can't make fun of yourself and embarrass yourself then what are you doing this is true oh man that was hilarious but i couldn't help but i was sitting there and like i was thinking like you know the the pina coladas on my enchiladas i don't know how you come up with this stuff but that little head of yours oh cool it's good now there's there's some uh there's some mice up there turning the wheels this is actually really good it's delish i almost think it's better than when we made these at home like using tortillas i agree it's it's really that's really good i would personally i think doing the rotel thing that we mentioned would probably be really good too because it'll give you some tomato and stuff in there as well yes maybe is there onion in our hotel let me just finish eating that but um the green chilies though were really good as well yes i literally cannot believe you just busted out in song like i am dead right now okay i'm gonna go have some lunch with this sinking handsome man over here but i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with us today don't forget to check out rockable down below in my description box if you're new we'd love
