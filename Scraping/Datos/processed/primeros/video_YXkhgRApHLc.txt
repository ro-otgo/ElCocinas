hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious that's my motto and today we'll be following that the star of the show is crab stuffed mushrooms delicious as an appetizer I'll be using some cremini mushrooms the small little brown ones like this conversely if you want to make this a Maine you can use the big portobello mushrooms put more stuffing into it and have that as a Maine to start out with your mushrooms you want to pop the stems off you'll see some recipes out there that use the stems back into their filling I however will put these aside maybe tomorrow I'll make myself a mushroom omelet but I think there's enough mushroom flavor in here so you pop these off and if you want to get a little more room in there you can use a spoon go around the edge and make a little extra room for your stuffing so let's get to the stuffing so in a bowl we will mix 1 cup of shredded cheese it's a Italian mixture of mozzarella parmesan Romano and provolone you can find these already mixed up and shredded in bags at your local grocery then we're going to put in 3 tablespoons of cream cheese [Music] and then six ounces of crab this was just right out of a can a tablespoon of parsley some finely diced spring onions when I say finely diced I mean like that very finely diced you don't want big clumps of onions in your mixture two tablespoons of breadcrumbs and a teaspoon of dill and one or two finely diced garlic cloves [Music] and I'm gonna season it with some Old Bay seasoning season it to your liking and we'll put another little doubt of that when we when we stuff the mushrooms so we'll mix this up all real well take your time when you're mixing this up you want to get it well mixed to it like like a paste and then we'll start stuffing our muck [Music] okay I've got a couple more to stuff when you're stuffing these be generous with your stuffing you want to get that thing plump right up over the top like so there's enough stuffing here to do about 12 to 15 mushrooms just like so [Music] okay let's get these in the oven I'm using a tin full pan easy cleanup little double Avoyelles spread it around with a paper towel just to prevent any sticky ovens preheated at 375 we'll pop it in there for about 20 minutes a little more obey seasoning just for little extra flavor on top you can cook these on the barbecue as well 375 medium to high heat on the top shelf close the lid 15 20 minutes they're done let's get these in the oven and there they are don't they look delicious oh boy my favorite time I get to try the goods they have like a nice little crust on them that's what you're looking for hmm oh my cheesy gooey gooey and crab you can't feed it your friends and family will love them in fact I'm gonna go share these with my neighbors don't forget to subscribe to my video you'll get notified every Monday when I put out a new one thanks for visiting in the kitchen with Pete until next time [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music]
