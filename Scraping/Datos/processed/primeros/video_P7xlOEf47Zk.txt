[Music] so [Music] [Music] hey y'all and welcome back to my channel i am so excited to get in the kitchen with you guys today i put out a holiday appetizers video like right before thanksgiving and you guys loved it and i told you then like i had so many more appetizers that i wanted to share with you guys so today i am bringing you part two to that video we're gonna make three more super easy delicious appetizers i cannot wait bunky picked out one of these and he has asked me probably like 15 times to make this so tonight is a night we're gonna make this appetizer for him and he is on pins and needles it's actually late at night right now or not late at night just like you know night time and monkey and i are going to make these and actually have them for dinner and i am so looking forward to it so on the menu tonight we are going to make the easiest and yummiest little like mini chicken and waffles they're going to be so much fun i cannot wait for these and honestly i feel like if you have any type of holiday party maybe next year i know this year looks a little different these would be like the perfect appetizer for everyone their own little toothpick so anyways we're gonna have those yes monkey but those will appeal to the children as well as adults they will oh my i'm like a kid y'all know that's like all i eat so i am most excited about that and then monkey's recipe that he's so excited about we're calling this like a stacked baked brie i'm calling it a bomb like a bomb of explosion because there's so many things in there like it's gonna be so good and then we're also gonna make some like bacon wrapped water chestnuts baked in the oven with like yummy chili brown sugar sauce on top oh my gosh y'all my mouth is a water ring i cannot wait for these so anyways a little sweet yes let's go ahead and get cooking so for this first one it is literally so simple you need three ingredients you need some frozen chicken nuggets some eggo minis we could only find the cinnamon toast ones i know they make them regular this was the only ones that we could find at like multiple grocery stores but we think the cinnamon toast is actually going to give it like some great flavor kind of like sweet and savory together so i'm not mad about it and then of course you need some syrup to drizzle over top so we're just going to put our chicken nuggets into our air fryer of course if you don't have an air fryer you can just bake yours in the oven and you can use whichever ones you like we just love getting these from sam's they're kind of like the chick-fil-a coffee cat chicken nuggets and we really like those and then we'll put these in the toaster for a few minutes and then we'll have some syrup to either drizzle on top or to dunk them in so simple and they're going to be so cute and so yummy [Music] bunky is making sure every single one is in its perfect location approximately two centimeters away from one inch okay [Music] i always just leave it at the 370 setting you can do what you want and it automatically goes to i think like 14 or 15 minutes i usually leave it on there as well [Music] it's mine on i probably should plug it in first let's try this again bam [Music] okay so now that your little mini eggos are nice and toasted just go ahead and pull them apart so they're kind of like an individual little size and then we'll pop our chicken nuggets on there and our warm maple syrup y'all oh my gosh these are gonna be so good [Music] okay so if you really want to get fancy and impress your guests you could totally like infuse this maple syrup you could put red pepper flakes in there rosemary sage like so many yummy things to give it lots of flavor um since it's just being funky we're just gonna use regular syrup but you could totally doctor these up and make them super fancy [Music] okay so if you like your chicken spicy like me throw on a little hot sauce does that not look so stinking delicious yo ass monkey and i like keep eating these things because they're so good like i cannot stop eating them i keep like thinking of so many more ideas that you could do with these and so is funky he says like you could get a tray of actual chick-fil-a nuggets which obviously i think would be incredible or make like your own little waffles and then i started thinking like if you made your own little waffles you could throw like peppers in there you could throw cheddar cheese in your waffles like you can make them like super savory or you can make them sweet like all kinds of different ways to make these okay so it is actually the next night last night bunkie and i tried to make our second recipe which was our bacon wrapped water chestnuts and the recipe needs toothpicks and i thought for sure we could make them without the toothpicks and they did not they actually tasted so good they just didn't turn out very pretty so monkey and i are like let's scratch this and just go get some toothpicks and we will film that recipe again tonight as well as our like brie that is gonna be so good so here we are it is night two we're gonna get started first on our bacon wrapped um water chestnuts y'all they were delicious like monkey and i kept going back for more of them i cannot wait for you guys to try these they're so easy um so get started on that and then we'll do the break i have everything laid out here that we're gonna need so of course you'll need some bacon and then you'll need some whole um water chestnuts sometimes it's hard to find the whole ones i found these at food lion i looked at walmart they did not have any or they were sold out so make sure that you get the ones that say whole and not halves or slivers and then we made this sauce last night but i will insert footage to show you exactly how to make it it's super simple it's just chili sauce a little bit of brown sugar and a little bit of mayo hopefully we have enough left and i just have some um i call them little skewers little toothpicks um okay skewers toothpicks whatever you want to use i have some here in some water just because we're gonna bake these in the oven i don't want them to like catch fire or anything so i'm gonna go ahead and open this drain it and then i'm actually gonna let bunkie cut our bacon because last night he did not like my size that i cut it so now it's on you buddy i'm gonna show i'm gonna show them how to do it just wait and y'all if you've never had water chestnuts you know how like picky i am and i love them so i say try them they have like a crunch to them i can't explain it they're soft but they have a crunch to them they're very very good not really any flavor so that's why you have to always like either soak them in soy sauce or do something and give them some flavor all right so i think please tell me your technique well i'm gonna go ahead and and trim off see this part right here uh-huh there's nothing that we need there okay i feel like that's just fattiness i might set that aside though i will keep i just want to point out that last night i did not use that part you didn't no i never said but monkey said that mine were like it's big and he wants them to be like this big what was what big my slices of bacon remember how big yeah you were all right i need you to hand me skewers and one skewer one water chestnut okay i cannot wait to see your skills no monkey that's not how you do it why does it have to go around the other way it doesn't matter see it's hard to do it that way no but yo i wish i could put in footage last night of him making fun of me but does it really matter that it's not see your pieces bacon are too long no way yes because it just needs to go around like that funky this is gonna be so good and look i don't think it really matters which direction your water chestnut is facing wow these are so long we can probably do two on each on a skewer let's do that i'm going to give me another chestnut please honestly like if you had two on a skewer and had these like singing a little tray for a party they would be so cute excuse me and i'm i'm doing the uh i'm trying to keep the the fatty side up or maybe that should go down but see as it cooks that'll render down across onto everything i like it water chestnut i feel like you got this technique from um monkey i've been watching this show on netflix what's it called the great great american barbecue cookoff or something yeah we had so much fun watching that show [Music] okay so i've got my foil lined pan here and i did go ahead and spray with just a little bit of pam just to make sure that these don't stick i know the bacon will give it a little bit of grease but i just wanted to ensure that they don't i'm going to line them up and i'm just going to brush them with our sauce and then we'll pop them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes so i'm going to go ahead and insert footage of us making the sauce last night the actual recipe is just a third of each thing so the heinz chili sauce mayo and brown sugar of course i just kind of eyeballed it and that is kind of a lot of sauce so it totally depends on how many of these you're making but if you plan on feeding a crowd definitely do the third of each [Music] so the water chestnuts are in the oven and we're going to go ahead and get started on the brie and just so y'all know bunkie has been waiting very patiently for this recipe if you saw our football food recipe i think it was um bunkie sent me this recipe before he ever even sent the muffaletta so it's been like a long time coming and probably we saved the best for last for tonight because this is going to be a may zing i think my patients will be rewarded yes okay so we have three things to breathe here which is what the original recipe calls for we all know brees kind of like thick so i think what we're gonna do is cut them in half like you saw this somewhere else somebody else did this yeah i did okay so let me explain to you kind of the gist of this so it's bree that's layered between like fig preserves you can use pomegranate preserves whatever one you have it's also going to have dijon mustard mozzarella cheese pepper jack cheese pecans honey prosciutto and then be wrapped in puff pastry and baked like literally i cannot wait for this my jaw my mouth is watering mine too i'm ready okay so let's go ahead and cut our brie in half so we have that prepared first okay you gotta guide me over there okay i really hope this works by the way i think it will okay how am i doing uh good it's getting a little thick in there [Music] just tell me what i'm gonna cut my hand okay [Music] okay so layer one down what goes on this one b uh is this the fig this is fig preserves but you can use kind of whatever preserves you want yeah i think any kind of fruit topping would be fine here fig is my absolute favorite so i think it's going to be amazing hey monkey this is going to be my jam oh my god leave it to monkey to come up with the corny joke i come up with this on the fly people is that too much nah that's plenty perfect that's gonna be good that's gonna squish out so we'll leave that like that and then add mozzarella to the top we're doing lots here okay so honey okay so layer two is honey chopped pecans and a sprinkle of pepper jack i feel like honey is one of those things i just don't consume enough of i know and every time i do i cannot get enough like i'm i'm real excited for this spoon oh there's already chopped oh it says chopped but uh they're not they're not very chopped so we're gonna throw them right there okay next layer is dijon mustard and then um more pepper jack so we're gonna put on it project uh-huh that's gonna be a good layer yeah it is it's like all this sweet and savory okay now we are going to wrap this in prosciutto and then we're going to wrap the entire thing in puff pastry wait what about layer number four oh i forgot we have an extra layer yeah we got an extra stack a big fig preserve again i think for this extra layer we do fig and pecans and mozzarella or pepper jack i think mozzarella i think since we just had a little bit of this might as well finish that off and then we can add a little bit of mozzarella yeah i'm actually thinking the pepper jack's gonna be real good [Music] okay so while monkey finishes rolling out our puff pastry i'm gonna go through and just kind of wrap this and prosciutto i'm just gonna drape it and then we'll tuck it on the bottom and make it really tight when everybody smiles eyes are shining bright i still remember how i used to feel look at us now [Music] walking okay i did make a little egg wash for this too by the way because every time we roll up a layer to the top we're gonna egg wash it so that it all stays put [Music] okay now you've got to cut little slivers on the top of this slivers like apple pie situation i know monkey so like a little little little little okay perfect good you're going too far down what's the point of the sliver then perfect that's good okay one more okay okay so we're gonna pop this into the oven at 400 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes i can't wait to see you on the other side it's like your little friend you made uh that's like a little uh love pouch and now while we wait we eat the water chestnuts are these hot they're still pretty warm but you can eat it oh my gosh so good right they're pretty hot or very the bacon with that chili sauce so good i'm like your hype man can we get it out yeah all right oh it leaked a little bit oh that's so good oh my gosh i just i'll get a fork and just like eat the leaves yeah i was gonna say you know how good that is gonna be after it like oh my god solidifies a little bit y'all y'all y'all oh my gosh monkey there are no words there are no words can we open this up like right now while it's bubbling and hot do we need to i think we might need to let it tool for it like chill out for just a minute you think i can not wait for this [Music] look in there though i mean y'all this is going to be so good monkey give me a bite you have a bite first since you have been waiting so long to have this you take the first bite and then i want some it's almost too hot to to take a bite right now okay we can let it cool off for a second if you want if you want something warm and creamy a little salty prosciutto gooey a little sweet gooey this is what you need okay i want a bite now is it cooled off enough for me oh it is on this plate oh my gosh please watch your finger oh good oh my gosh i won't get back in there you want hollow at this right here oh my gracious this is unreal i think this would go fast in a crowd yeah it might already be gone actually yes okay if y'all remember in our trader joe's haul monkey and i got these like crackers it tastes like rosemary and garlic they're so good and i just got them out and put a big hunk of this cheese on them oh my gosh game over like this is re donkulously
