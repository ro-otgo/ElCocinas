now I am totally down with having a drink with these guys crispy crunchy and they're so cute my little twist on the prawn cocktail we're gonna do the wonton cups first this couldn't be easier guys so simple it's why I love this as an entertaining dish now get yourself some wonton wrappers and I like to cut these into round circles because if you leave them square the sort of corners kind of stick up and they get all burnt and brown in the oven which I don't like so I'm cutting these just like that now the Asian mum in there is not gonna let anything oh yes sir don't throw these guys away pop them in the freezer next time you're doing a wonton noodle soup just to throw them in with your noodles and they make a nice little addition you really want a neutral tasting oil here I really don't want my Asian style prawn cocktail to have some olive oil kind of flavor so rice bran oil vegetable oil peanut oil any of those things is fine now a couple of tricks here to get the perfect one time cup so what you want on wrap it in create some little folds in the side don't have all the folds bunched up at once now the aim here is to get rid of all the air we don't want any air pockets expanding and ruining our pretty little wonton cups okay so there's only need five minutes in a hot oven until they're nice and crispy now you can't have an ultimate front hotel without the ultimate cocktail sauce and mine obviously has a little bit of an Asian twist which I love but first of all standard we start off with some mayonnaise and some ketchup it's almost a sheer sauce and now here's where we go all rogue and add our Asian ingredient and I'm using a Korean chili paste called gotcha Jeong and I want a fair decent spoonful of that this is like all spicy and silky and Mommy flavored and just add such an awesome kick to your cocktail sauce and then we want some extra tang with some fresh lime juice now I'm gonna get all fancy here and make myself a little piping bag so into a cup that's the easiest way to go about it and then pour all that saucy goodness right in there twist all right time to get the rest of my ingredients ready and I've just got some shredded iceberg lettuce and a little bit of coriander my prawns of course and I'm just gonna grab this avocado it's a little bit of that and I want some pretty fine dices of avocado a little cups are gonna be very small and dainty so whenever cut it'll be the same now just squeeze a little bit of lime juice on that avocado to stop it from browning and add some extra flavor anyway and now these amazing looking prawns now these are quite large so I'm gonna cut them in half lengthways it just all depends on the size of the prawn that you've got so what we want to end up with are just some nice little chunks that will fit inside our little cups [Music] now these have had time to cool down and they're super crispy and uber cute so get those out onto a platter now if you want to make these the day before just store them in an airtight container just at room temperature in your pantry so they stay nice and crispy a little bit of lettuce in the bottom of each cup because of course you want everything fresh and vibrant and lovely for your party guests I would do this assembly stage just before your guests arrive you don't want these sitting around too long because things will get a little bit soggy okay now makeshift piping bag just cut the end of that and I'm gonna little drizzle on my lettuce leaves some chunky pieces of those beautiful prawns you could totally do this with crab as well or some little chunks of lobster if you want to get really fancy and then a little bit more sauce because you can always have more sauce actually when it's all spicy and creamy and delicious like this one okay a little bit of avocado on there I feel like I'm in an episode of tiny kitchen and then a final flourish of some finely chopped coriander now if Cayenne is not your thing don't worry you could use a spring onion or a little bit of mint or just leave the hooks off all together and there you have it guys the ultimate if not the cutest little prawn cocktail you'll see this holiday season don't you [Music]
