happy autumn everyone as you know the best way to beat a bulge Hill is a nice warm bowl of soup a few weeks ago I asked you guys to let me know on Instagram and on Facebook what kind of soups you wanted to see on the channel and the number one response was butternut squash soup so today I'm going to share my favorite butternut squash soup recipe and the best part is it's actually so so easy to put together so for this recipe I'm getting started a by roasting my squash and there are two reasons for this the first peeling a squash is a real pain so if you're roasting it you don't actually have to feel it until it's already cooked and then is a total cinch the second and more important reason is that roasting squash actually helps it develop a really beautiful flavor so it is totally worth do it all I'm going to do is cut off the top and bottom of my squash and cut it in half you'll want to use a very large and very sharp kitchen knife for this process because it can be a bit difficult to get through then I'm going to use an ice cream scoop just scoop out the seeds and I'm going to season it with a little olive oil and some salt and pepper I'm going to place my squash on a baking sheet into the oven it goes but 375 for between 45 minutes and an hour or until it's fork-tender once it's ready you can pull it out from the oven and then simply scoop out all the squashy goodness I'm going to set my squash aside and get started on the rest of my soup so I've got a Dutch oven heating up on the stove into that I'm going to add some oil next I'm going to add a handful of fresh sage leaves now it's going to do two things first it's going to infuse our oil with a whole lot of beautiful autumn flavor next the sage leaves themselves can be removed and saved for a beautiful garnish at the very end now that we have removed our sage leaves to our oil we are going to add a diced yellow onion and a diced granny smith apple now I love using apple and butternut squash soup because it adds a nice sweetness that you can't get without it I'm going to saute these until they soften up and then I'm going to add a whole lot of beautiful vegetable stock and my butternut squash you could also use chicken stock if that's what you had on hand I'm going to season this up well with some salt and some pepper and then I'm going to let it simmer for between 15 and 30 minutes once your soup is done simmering your house is going to smell amazing you can turn off the heat and you can either finish it off with a little bit of heavy cream or if you wanted to keep this recipe completely vegan you can also add some cashew milk that would totally work here finally the last step is to puree this beautiful soup and you can do that one of two ways the first is to use an immersion blender the second is to use your traditional blender you need to use extreme caution when blending hot liquids for a full how-to tutorial on how to do that be sure to check out this video I've also left the instructions in the description box below now that it's nice and smooth and gorgeous it's just a matter of serving it with those beautiful fried sage leaves and some toasted pumpkin seeds for good measure I hope you'll give this delicious recipe a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I love hearing from you and if you've got any great soup ideas you'd like to see on the show be sure to leave them in the comment section below and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there's lots more deliciousness where this came from
