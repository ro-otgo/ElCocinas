[Music] hi folks are welcome to in the kitchen with Pete staying indoors a lot these days as we all are and as we all should but it sure gives me a lot of time to be creative and today I put together a delicious cabbage and vegetable soup I put a couple ingredients that you may never have used in soups but i'm tanja it makes it rich delicious unforgettable stick with me let's get to it I've got all my ingredients prepped and ready to go I'm using an 8 quart pot I've got my heat set to a medium to high and I'm going to put a tablespoon of olive oil now for what's also known as a mirepoix I'm going to add 1 cup of diced onions 1 cup of diced carrots and 1 cup of diced celery we'll stir this in for about four or five minutes and then we'll make a little spot open on the bottom of the pot add a teaspoon of olive oil and stir in three cloves of garlic that's finely diced stir that in for about a minute and we'll add one teaspoon of oregano 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning a teaspoon of pepper and then we'll add an 8 ounce can of core 28 ounces of diced tomatoes and stir in five cups of chopped cabbage and 12 cups of broth it's your choice on the broth you can use chicken or vegetable I'm using a tomato and chicken bouillon commonly used in Mexican recipes can be found in latina and Mexican grocery stores as you've noticed I haven't added any salt to this soup and that's because of the high salt content in this boyo here's another great option I use frequently and they come in chicken and vegetable and beef flavor booyah it's a paste it lasts in the fridge for months this particular one is organic it's called better than bullion and it's low in sodium now here's one of my secret ingredients 1 cup of Clamato juice now let's talk about Clamato juice for a second it's very popular in Canada in fact it would be hard to find a bar or restaurant that doesn't serve up the drink a Caesar or also known as a bloody Caesar it just has Clamato juice and vodka some seasonings and some people top them off with all sorts of toppings my buddy Andy let me show you a picture of some of his now look of Andy's dazzle his up bacon pepperoni sausage shrimp it's endless get creative make it your own the Bloody Mary the flavors are totally different more tomato juice based vodka as well and then some typical salt and pepper and seasonings I always found it on you just go south of the border down to the US and you can't find Komada juice in the bars and restaurant it's a great drink this one here actually is seasoned with pickled bean they have some different flavors it's outstanding and said the old famous Caesar to cure a hangover I've been using Clamato juice for years to enhance some of my recipes and soups red sauces spaghetti sauces Chili's and so on give it a try it's a great drink let's get back to the recipe now after the broth and the Clamato juice has been put into our soup we'll add 2 bay leaves and we'll bring it to a boil cover it lower the temperature and then let it simmer for about 30 minutes we want to get that cabbage and vegetables nice and tender now here's my next secret ingredient apple cider vinegar one ounce of it we have a lot of liquid here so it's not going to overpower the flavor will just help intensify the flavor of the vegetables try it I think you'll like it we'll let that simmer for another 10 minutes and it's time to serve it up oh my doesn't that look tasty nice and chunky there's a lot there I can share it with my neighbors and family and it freezes well for months oh boy I think maybe some nice fresh Italian bread with a little butter [Music] well that doesn't take long at all and let me throw another idea out there to you you have somebody who just has to have some meat in their soup how about chicken during the last 20 minutes of cooking your soup you can drop a boneless skinless piece of chicken it only takes 10 to 15 minutes to poach it in the liquids after it's cooked you take it out shred it with a couple of forks back into your soup and wall up chicken vegetable soup it's easy anyways I'm gonna enjoy this cabbage and vegetable soup just the way it is Oh [Music] that bra is so rich nobody would ever guess at those couple secret ingredients that apple cider vinegar and Clamato you'd never pick that up after but it gives it some rich flavors you're going to love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time say [Music]
