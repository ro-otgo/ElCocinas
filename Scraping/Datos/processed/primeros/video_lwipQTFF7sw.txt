[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete why am i standing out in my garage I just had to show you my fresh garlic we just harvested it we grow it over at my mother and father in law's they're kind enough to give me up a chunk of their backyard to grow it even though they can't stand you're like so for the next few weeks you're probably gonna see some recipes with garlic and it's August here in Ontario fresh corn we're gonna be making a nice corn chowder or put some ham and some potatoes and some garlic you're gonna love it let's get to the kitchen you'll have to excuse my voice I'm a little hoarse just getting over a cold I better eat more garlic now check out this way of taking off the kernels I'm taking a ramekin and putting it at the bottom of a stainless steel bowl and just slice off the kernels they fall into your stainless steel bowl it's quite handy now use the back of the knife to squeeze out all that juice in the cob we don't want to waste that now once you've completed four cobs split it in half we're gonna put half into a mixer and add 1/4 cup of vegetable or chicken stock give that a good mix we want to get it nice and creamy we'll set that off to the side and get to our vegetables it means one white onion medium to a large size and finely diced into a bowl set it off to the side two stalks of celery finely dice put it into a bowl set it off to the side one potato of big yellow potato finely diced put that into a bowl set it off to the side now let's get to our garlic we're gonna use a whole head of garlic and then we're chop that up finely dice it run your knife through it several times into a bowl and set that off to the side next I'm gonna cube up some nice smoked ham I need two cups of that alternatively you could use some cooked bacon now this next step normally you would do in the pot you're making the soup but I'm doing it in a pan just to give you a better view so we got two tablespoons of butter and then we'll add a teaspoon of olive oil that's melted we can add our onions and our celery and then we're going to season it with a half a teaspoon of each time oregano and dill and then we'll season it as well with a pinch of salt and pepper we can always season that more at the end now here's another option if you like to spice it up a bit I like to add a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes gives a little bit of heat again that's optional continue on a medium heat for two or three minutes and then we'll add our smoked cook pan continue to saute for another three or four minutes moving it around and then we'll add our garlic stir the garlic in thoroughly and let it cook for another two three minutes and now it's time to thicken this up let's not our last two tablespoons of butter melted into our mixture and then our three tablespoons of flour that's called making a roux we're thickening that up once that's mixed up well I can transfer it to my stockpot and begin to add my five cups of chicken stock vegetable stock will work as well at the beginning put in a little bit at a time till it gets nice and smooth then you can add the remaining of the stock now we can add the remainder of our ingredients the kernels of corn we'll put that in and then the corn that we mixed up in our blender that'll go in next and then we'll add our potatoes give that a good stir and there it is doesn't look delicious place a lid on the pot and once it comes to a boil we'll turn it down to a low heat let it simmer for 20 minutes stirring occasionally after 20 minutes we can add our heavy cream 2 cups of it stir it in well and when your potatoes are soft it's ready to go now it doesn't that look lovely I like to add some croutons to mine well that was another simple and delicious recipe if you've got some ideas on how I should use my fresh garlic you can contact me here on youtube or on Facebook in the kitchen with Pete or email which is in the kitchen with Pete at gmail.com well now I'm going to try the goods nice and creamy oh you can also top it off with creative cheddar cheese [Music] oh wow fresh corn some smoky ham some potatoes and some fresh garlic you can't beat it you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time Thea [Music] [Music] baby please don't pretend [Music]
