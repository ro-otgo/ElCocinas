[Music] this week on in the kitchen with pete we're putting together a delicious pasta dish [Music] welcome to in the kitchen with pete today we're doing a delicious tomato mushroom rigatoni and then rather than throwing it all into one pot we're gonna layer those seasonings along the way you'll end up with a much more deep luxurious sauce you're gonna love it let's get to it let's do a little prep work we're going to need eight ounces of mushrooms clean them with a damp paper towel if you submerge them in water they're like a sponge it'll just suck up all that water here's a little tip slicing up the mushrooms make your first cut and now you have a flat surface and cut away from there first cut flat surface done simple as that our next item to prep is two large cloves of garlic and we want those smashed so give them a smash pull off the skins cut off each end and voila there's your two lovely pieces of garlic and then we'll give those a smash look at that perfect and we'll set those off to the side next item we'll need 2 to 3 tablespoons of finely diced onions you can run your knife through them a couple of times and then we'll set those off to the side you can purchase mild italian ground sausage meat or i just have some sausage here and i'm going to remove the skins also known as the casing just simply slice the sausage and remove the casing now let's get to the sauce it's important to use a good quality tomato san marzano that's the one to get 1 16 ounce can of that and then we'll use a 22 ounce jar of san marzano strained tomatoes don't skip on the quality of these tomatoes it really makes a difference break them up with your hands or a potato masher like i'm doing and next we'll add one six ounce can of tomato paste and season it with one teaspoon of oregano and a half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and then next we'll add our smashed garlic and our two to three tablespoons of finely diced onions six fresh basil leaves just tear them up and add them to the pot and to cut the acidity of the tomatoes we'll add a packet of stevia or a teaspoon of sugar and one pinch of salt now we'll bring that to a boil we'll reduce the heat to low and cover it to begin cooking our sausage coat the pan with a little bit of cooking spray or on a medium to high heat break up the sausage to begin browning it let's add a little more seasoning one half teaspoon of oregano and a half a teaspoon of garlic powder and a half a teaspoon of onion powder and we'll mix that all well and continue to cook until brown after it's brown you can remove excess fat if required my sauce has come to a boil i'm going to stir in the sausage and place the temperature down to low and cover it [Music] i'll use the same pan that i cooked the sausage to cook my mushrooms and we'll do the same process season along the way let's add one to two teaspoons of olive oil and a half a teaspoon of oregano and a pinch of pepper don't salt the mushrooms early it'll draw the moisture out you end up with a pan full of watery mushrooms we'll brown these up on a medium to high heat and then add a pinch of salt it's coming together let's add those mushrooms into the sauce and then we'll cover it and let it simmer on low for 30 minutes bring a pot of water to boil and we'll add two to three teaspoons of salt now how much reggaetoni pasta per person i know it's always a question about one and a half cup per person or i use my favorite coffee cup here one per person we'll add that to our boiling water and in 12 minutes or according to your package and it'll be done now while our pasta's boiling let's add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan this just of course adds some fabulous flavor maybe a little extra on top after the rigatoni pasta is done we'll just simply drain that shake it a couple of times get rid of the excess water and then into a bowl and now let's add our sauce now you can't just lay this on top and add a generous amount and then stir it up you want to get it inside that rigatoni it just kind of sucks up in those tubes and makes it delicious while you're eating it you can place that onto a plate a serving plate and then you can add a little more sauce on top and then maybe we'll garnish that with a little bit of fresh basil yes just like that doesn't that look mouth-watering maybe a little side of fresh garlic toast oh my you're gonna love it well that was another simple and delicious recipe i hope you get to try it out with your friends and family and if you like it i have over 150 recipes on youtube to date check them out i think you'll love them and don't forget to subscribe hit that little red subscribe button down below you'll get notified every time i post a new video thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pete until next time see ya [Music] you
