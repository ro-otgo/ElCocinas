[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with me today simple and delicious quesadillas if you haven't had them before they're delicious you may have had them in a restaurant they're simple to cook they've been eating them for hundreds of years in Mexico let's get to it you'll need one large cooked chicken breast you can poach it fry it or I just ate mine in the oven put a little olive oil salt and pepper baked at 375 20 to 30 minutes done let it cool take a couple of forks and shred it into pieces and set it aside we'll also need to prepare one small firm tomato and just dice that up into little cubes and we'll set that aside as well in another pan on a medium to high heat we'll need a half of an onion and a half of red bell pepper just dice them into strips also known as julian add one tablespoon of olive oil and let's season this up starting out with 2 teaspoons of chili powder 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion powder 1/2 teaspoon of cumin 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper while stirring frequently we just want to soften up the veg it'll take about five minutes when they've softened up we're going to add some pickled jalapenos two to three tablespoons just dice them up gives it some great flavor add the shredded chicken and the diced up tomatoes to our mixture stir that well and our final ingredients will be the juice of 1/2 of a line it'll just give it some texture moisture and just a little pop of citrus make sure that's nice and warm and we'll set that aside in another pan on a low to medium heat add a little drizzle of olive oil spread it around the pan using the small size soft tortilla this recipe will give me three to four quesadillas now I've shredded up some Monterey Jack and sharp cheddar cheese that's our first item we'll add on top of the soft tortilla be generous and then we'll add our chicken and vegetable mixture again be generous with that as well and then on top of that some more cheese please now we need another soft tortilla on top and here's a trick use a pot to weight it down and then if it's not heavy enough you can see I've added a heavy soup cup inside this will ensure that it gets nice and golden brown it takes about five minutes take a peek underneath yeah that looks good flip it over look at that nice and golden brown let's get our weight back on top and about another four to five minutes it'll be done take a peek looks terrific now let's slice it up and serve it I like to use a pizza cutter it just slides right through with no effort at all take a look inside oh boy let's serve this up you can serve it up with salsa or sour cream oh my doesn't that look delicious [Music] well that was another simple and delicious recipe you can make these prior to your friends and family arriving they warm up nicely I think you're gonna enjoy them I'm going to enjoy now [Music] Oh dipped and sour cream or salsa whichever you or bird you're gonna love them well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with me until next time [Music] [Music] baby please don't pretend [Music]
