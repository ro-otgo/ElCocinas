hi lovelies soup season is in full swing at least at my house and today i am sharing a delicious asian inspired soup that i think you guys are going to absolutely devour it's this chicken ramen soup and it comes together in less than 20 minutes which is why i love it so much it's perfect if you're feeling a little bit under the weather because it's loaded with things like garlic and ginger and other great good for you ingredients so it's one of those soups you'll definitely want to add to your repertoire as the winter months are upon us now to get started i have got my nice big dutch oven heating up on the stove you could do this with a soup pot as well if you wanted to and i'm just going to add a little bit of oil to that as soon as that oil is nice and hot i'm going to add my chicken to the pot now i'm using just some boneless skinless chicken breasts that i've cut into small cubes you could definitely do this with boneless skinless chicken thighs if you wanted to or you could skip the meat in this recipe entirely and leave it vegetarian it's absolutely up to you i'm going to season my chicken breast with a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper and then i'll let it cook up for maybe five or six minutes just until it's no longer pink and it started to get a little golden around the edges now it is time to start building some flavor in here so i have got one small yellow onion that i have just finely diced i've also got some minced garlic headed in here as well as some freshly grated ginger so like i said if you're feeling a little under the weather there's nothing like ginger and garlic to help clear your sinuses it also happens to smell amazing so your kitchen instantly is just going to smell absolutely delightful while that onion is just cooking away i will give you guys a bit of a bump update um yes in case you missed it i am indeed pregnant i'm about five and a half months now so 24 weeks uh it's hard to believe in just a few months we're going to have another little one in this household let's just say things are already quite busy here so it should be interesting but of course i am super super excited to welcome this one to our family and i have been extra hungry lately as you might imagine so soups like this have been really really wonderful and then we're going to go ahead and add our broth to this now here i'm using chicken broth but you could also use some mushroom broth or even some vegetable broth both of those would work definitely just a matter of what you have on hand in your pantry and then we're just going to bring this mixture to a boil so once that broth has reached a nice rolling boil i like to turn my heat down to medium and now it's time to add some veggies to this and the best part about this soup is that the sky is really the limit in terms of what kinds of veggies you can add to this basically go through your produce drawer pull out what you have and toss it in you can use some broccoli cauliflower red bell pepper would be really amazing pretty much whatever you have on hand today i'm using a combination of mushrooms which are really classic in a lot of asian cooking so we're gonna get those into our pot for my greens i'm going to be adding some baby bok choy to this now baby bok choy is a bit of a bitter asian green if you're not a fan or you can't find any where you live you can go ahead and use some spinach or kale here instead this is just a great soup to sneak some greens in so i highly recommend doing that and i am also going to be getting some snow peas in here snap peas would totally work as well and we're basically just going to dump them all into the pot and then let them cook away for maybe two to three minutes it doesn't take very long at all with that hot broth for your veggies to just soften up and you'll start to see them turn nice and bright green and that is a good sign you don't want your veggies to get super soggy you want to make sure they still retain a bit of their crunch and after giving our veggies about a one to two minute head start here i am going to add my ramen to this so i'm using just classic ramen here if you wanted to keep this gluten-free you could use some rice noodles instead those would totally work in this recipe and then the final step here is just going to be adding some soy sauce or some tamari to this tamari is just gluten-free soy sauce it's really just a matter of preference because it adds this nice sort of savory flavor that is absolutely irresistible and in a matter of mere minutes friends we are in the promised land so our ramen is fully cooked and nice and tender our veggies are bright green they look incredible my kitchen is just filled with the most amazing aroma i wish you guys could smell it and that means it is time to get our soup on i like topping it simply with some finely sliced green onion and a sprinkle of sesame seeds but if you wanted to kick it up a notch you could totally add some sriracha or red pepper flakes just to add a bit of heat totally up to you but i promise you guys you will not regret making this recipe it is full of amazing flavor and comes together in under 20 minutes in a single pot there is so much to love and i really hope you enjoy it as much as i do if you give it a try for yourselves don't forget to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because
