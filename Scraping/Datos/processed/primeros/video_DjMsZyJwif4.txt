[Music] hello my sweet friends welcome back to my channel monkey and i are in the kitchen and we are so excited we did this video for you guys last year and you really seemed to like it so we're going to do it again this year we are making all of the yummy football food we have football on the tv my brother is coming over later we plan to watch some football all night so i am so excited for this talk about cheat day we are going all in y'all we are not holding back like i am so excited bucky wants to make something called muff muffaletta so we're gonna be making that and then also i'm gonna make buffalo chicken smothered tater tots oh my gosh i cannot wait we were actually at the beach and we went to eat at um what's it called b bagwoods yes and they have like a football menu and i got their buffalo chicken nachos they were delicious but bunkie got a philly cheesesteak with tater tots and i had some of his tots and i like dipped them in my like buffalo sauce and ranch and blue cheese and all that oh my gosh it was so good and i'll be funky we gotta make like this is where you found your answer this is where i got my inspiration from okay i cannot wait like they're gonna be so good and we're gonna do the entire thing in the air fryer so it's gonna be so simple besides grilling the chicken and then also we're gonna make the easiest and most delicious fried pickles this looks like the third or fourth time we have made these and seriously they are so easy and they are delicious so i cannot wait i'm going to flip you guys around and we are going to get to cooking so we are starting with monkeys muffin yeah so tell us where you got this idea i got i i get this inspiration from my um some of my in-laws in-laws my family my family my aunts and uncle lived down in new orleans and um they just kind of gave me they like introduced me to this sandwich or whatever and i've always just kind of enjoyed it and i think it would be a very interesting thing to share with all of the people because i feel like it's very regional perhaps and like you don't necessarily unless you know somebody who lived down there or whatever like you're not necessarily gonna know what this type this little concoction is okay so monkey's gonna get started chopping his garlic and i'm gonna kind of give you guys the rundown of everything so we have this um i think it's called gardener i can't really say it but we're gonna drain that chop it up add it to our bowl as well as these little um pimento stuffed olives and then we're gonna add some oregano dried oregano and then a little like a black pepper and a splash of olive oil yeah as well as some garlic so that's gonna go in our sandwich we also have provolone um what's here mortadella ham and salami yeah and normally like this this is a shortcut right here um normally you would like take all of these individual ingredients and combine them together but this is great for the most part everything is like right here that you need anyway so yeah great time saver and then we're going to put this all into like pizza dough roll it up egg wash it bake it in the oven it's going to be so good um yeah look forward to it yeah look at that we got all this good stuff here there's so much more there than like what i thought yeah so we have some cauliflower celery there's onion some carrot red bell pepper and all these pepperoncinis i think there's cucumber in there too okay i'm gonna cut these stems liberally off of here oh my gosh it's so good funky i'm so excited for this sandwich no idea this is what i'm here for i know you are on game day so i just chopped this up and then i put it back i took it off the cut board put it back over here in our little sifter because there's all this like juice in there still and like i don't want my dough to get real soggy so we're kind of getting a little bit more of this juice out of here and that is delicious flavor you just thought that drink it you want me to no i will i think it's probably good for me [Music] is it good that is strong it was good though yeah it's like pickle juice really now we're gonna get started on the olives so we're just gonna drain these a little bit as well and then chop them up into like little tiny pieces [Music] this is this is not the best way to transport nuts he just said do you think i should add all of this i added all of it okay so we're gonna do a little bit of oregano pepper and like the tiniest bit of olive oil to this and toss it together yeah because normally like in this sandwich that has more like olive oil and and stuff in it because it's not like wrapped inside of something but i think with this being like rolled up and all that together like you don't want too much too much moisture so yeah [Music] i mean if you ask me you could just totally eat that with some crackers okay but he sprinkled his oregano in here that was about seven taps by the way seven taps to be specific okay what do you need next your pizza dough yes by the way i went to the grocery store by myself and all monkey told me was pizza dough so in my mind i got him just like this pizza crust sheet so in a can so i may have gotten the wrong thing i think you're really supposed to have like actual pizza dough so we're still hoping this is going to turn out fine um if it doesn't then we totally suggest getting the real pizza dough i think this is actually a very clever shortcut if it works if it works but i think it'll be really great which this by the way is just the pillsbury pizza crust [Music] like when i unroll this does this fold in half does this unfold that's all we got that's why i didn't get you as much uh mortadella and stuff because i was like this will be perfect oh it's just me you and jacob we're not feeding an army we're gonna need a rolling pin okay we're gonna stretch this dough out never mind i'll stretch it by hand okay i'll stretch it by hand hit me with some more olive oil okay i got you let me oh what that was a little bit more than i'm bargained for but you know let's just let's just get into it get into it look at that it's really stretching out i think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised i am actually for you i am impressed right now at the stretchiness of this candle i'm not gonna lie this is super cool actually yeah i agree i do recommend the extra olive oil on your hands yeah check that out bonk look at that it's pretty good we stretched it out okay are you gonna start layering yeah now you're only gonna put your stuff on one side because you're gonna roll it yeah [Music] let's go ham next though okay but you're gonna have i'm touching the ham because this is my lunch meat too i don't want you touching it with that stuff all right [Music] oh my god that ham looks so good okay and now the mortadella so that was salami is martinella kind of like bologna yes like fancy bologna but it has pistachios in it i think it just yeah it has pistachio and peppercorns in it if i'm not mistaken check that out huh this is like a sandwich lovers dream this is a sandwich fit for a king this is what it is that's a little bit of a double up that's gonna be okay though [Music] so you do your cheese next or do you add cheese your stuff actually we were supposed to put the cheese down first are you sure no you weren't it was the meat it was the cheese let me watch the video i know i know it was the cheese it's gonna be okay though because watch this right here do you have the camera on it's on bay look at that are you sure yeah i'm positive go ahead and start popping this problem now okay all right so we're using provolone cheese if you want to do swiss or mozzarella whatever you want but i think provolone's probably i think any uh melty white sliced cheese is gonna be just fun yeah oh my gosh how am i gonna roll this boo you still gotta put your other stuff on i know but then that's it so that's good i don't think you have to add all that unless you want to this is your sandwich no i'm not gonna ask quite all of it this is the flavor factory right here monkey one day we're gonna get you your own dictionary like you're gonna make your own dictionary with your words up mm-hmm i'm [Music] down see i mean i've gotten the majority of it right i guess let's see here oh my gosh i mean i don't like these things but i wish i did because it really looks so good it smells good too i'm gonna just add a little bit more okay basically all that why not right yeah now how are we gonna get this to roll up i have no idea okay okay okay well i'm gonna come at you from other side oh my gosh this isn't even gonna work boo i feel like i'm gonna need like some kind of support system here [Music] oh look at it here we go oh yeah we made it over oh my gosh i cannot believe you just did that check that out huh oh i pulled it tucked it i feel like i just need to pull this over that top part okay let me get your egg wash i'm like so impressed by the way that you did this and we're gonna kind of pin tuck the end here pinch um bt dub the recipe calls for sesame seeds on top of the egg wash but we don't have any so we're just forgoing that part dude can you believe that no i really cannot that is awesome i'm still just over here tucking my baby away i'm sorry bunk that is a loaf of love it sure is i'm honestly like so excited for you because i just know you are going to be so obsessed i just oh gosh oh what are you doing monkey i lost the egg you need him to beat that egg a little bit more i guess i did um go ahead and beat it a little bit more now b i got it um i don't even know i'm saying to you now okay so the recipe calls for there to be like little slits in here so we're just gonna cut like three on the very top you get more than three yeah i'm gonna do more than three this releases the uh steam from the inside did you know that no i didn't is that really even through there yeah it's perfect okay so now we're going to pop it in the oven we're going to do 375 for like 40 45 minutes yes hopefully we will confirm the cook time and touch okay so all that's in the oven i'm gonna go ahead and get started on this chicken i'm just gonna go put this on the grill but i did want to show you guys what i've had it marinating in so i did just a little bit of ranch dressing some frank's red hot sauce and then i did quite a bit of this kicking chicken to kind of give it some spice and then just a little bit of ranch seasoning and it's been marinating like half of the day so it should be nice and flavorful i'll go ahead and grill that and then we'll kind of assemble everything in the air just wait till you see this and by the way the recipe we went off of said 40 minutes but because we used this pizza dough we only did like 25. yeah we put it on 25 and it still has three to go holy moly y'all just wait till you see this i mean i am beyond impressed i'm beyond impressed bunky okay listen okay i grilled my chicken it's sitting here resting i'm gonna go ahead and pop my tater tots into the air fryer can i just tell you that i love air fryer i literally use it almost every single day it is my favorite kitchen gadget accessory whatever that i have ever owned i was gonna say bong for all the people who commented and said that we're gonna like it more than the uh other device that we bought they were totally right it's amazing we literally use it every day oh and whatever video it was recently although what i eat in a day and you guys told me to put my um hash browns into the airfryer i did that and oh my gosh game changer they were so good to thank you um anywho i'm going to pop my tater tots into the airfryer and then let this chicken rest for a few minutes and then we're going to make our buffalo chicken mixture and then right before the tater tots are about done we'll give it a few minutes um we'll pop all of that on top of them put it back in the air fryer let it melt and get ooey gooey and then it'll be done so simple and literally my mouth is like watering i cannot wait what i just the magic that's happening in there this i don't even know i want to show them so bad can i no okay they must wave okay b will you get my tear tights yeah okay so we do have the extra large airfryer so if you have like a smaller one you can do this in the oven just as easily i just like this would be like super simple and really fast and i did cover the bottom completely that way it like prevents more massive like the cheese oozing underneath so anywho i cover the bottom let's put these bad boys in i feel like you're crazy by the way for doing this yeah it's experimental just how you always say you're experimenting so am i well i know but i'm saying like well well yeah okay let me say let me say something else i'm not cleaning up whatever happens okay but let me say b i only am doing it in here because these get so crispy in there oh we gotta we gotta hurry okay okay let's get this going i'm doing it in here because it get crispier okay whatever start okay sorry it'll start okay let's do it let's do it where am i going to set this bad boy that thing starting no okay are you all ready are you ready yeah okay yeah i am we're ready i'm ready just wait till it comes up here okay okay all right good thing i cleaned the stove a little bit oh my gosh funky that is cheese oozing out of them things i do have a disclaimer real quick i didn't plan for the cheese to be on top like that so i think that was just by chance but we're thankful for it looks good oh my gosh oh my gosh look at that that's insane have you ever seen something so beautiful no never you know what i'm even going to say this that almost looks like a football it really does that's the laces right there and just pick that shut the front door take that thing and throw it in my mouth oh my gosh monkey i cannot wait for you to cut into that what are the chances that was a good football we didn't even plan it you knew all along okay while that rests these are in here we gotta get started on this buffalo chicken dip oh my gosh i have never seen a more beautiful neither that is beautiful let me let me instagram it just say guess what's inside okay okay so i'm gonna cut all of these up into bite-sized pieces we're gonna add in about half a block of cream cheese and then a little bit of ranch a little bit of frank's red hot some garlic powder a little bit more ranch seasoning because why not we'll mix that all together and then we'll add in some i got some gorgonzola you can use that blue cheese whatever you want and then also some sharp cheddar cheese mix it together throw it on top it tastes so good [Music] omg yeah it does okay got chicken really absorbs some of that flavor yeah i did [Music] okay about half a block of softened cream cheese going in okay now to this mixture i'm gonna add about a quarter cup of ranch dressing and then you can add in as much hot sauce as you want if you like it less spicy then do less you guys know we like it pretty spicy and then i'm just gonna add in about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of um garlic powder as well i know that air fryer is kind of loud so hopefully y'all can hear me good but this is pretty much like the consistency that you want and then i'm going to go ahead and add in about this much gorgonzola or blue cheese whichever one you want and then some cheese and after i get that incorporated and we put them back in we'll add a little bit more cheese to the top to make them nice and melted okay tots are like pretty much cooked so i'm gonna go ahead and put all of this on top oh my gosh bunji i'm so excited [Music] making a mess without making a mess that is gonna be nothing but a mess it's fine it's gonna be just fine i mean it's gonna taste right oh my gosh this is going to be so stinking delicious okay hit it with that rest of that shredded okay now that we got this on here or go ahead and put some more shredded cheese

making these so much i could have sworn i had an entire new jar of like the little pickle chips but apparently i do not we have the spears but not the chips so um there are a few left in this jar so i am going to make them and show you guys but we don't have that many which things but honestly we have so much other food we don't even need these but they're so easy and like so yummy so i do want to show them to you so i'm gonna flip you around and we're gonna make a couple little fried pickles i'm dying laughing because this is literally only how many pickles we have but i just put them on a little plate with a paper towel and went ahead and like dab them off so they're pretty dry um you don't want them to be soaking wet and then in this bowl i just have a little bit of like all-purpose flour i'm gonna add some ranch seasoning lowry seasoned salt and garlic powder you guys know like our three favorite things you can add whatever seasonings you want and then i'm just going to add a little bit of beer to this until i get like a really good batter you can just eyeball that until you get the consistency that you want and by the way you can use whatever beer you want or if you don't want to use a beer you could use buttermilk probably like soda soda soda water or something like that you do not have to use the beer it's just easy we have it here so anyway i'm going to go ahead and mix it together yes sir you said we have it here well we do but the carbonation like makes it more airy exactly it makes it very light yes like what monkey was saying is um what we've loved about these is just the batter on there it's like so airy it's amazing so anyway i'm gonna go ahead and mix this together and we'll get them [Music] frying [Music] i got a salsa right when they come out you
