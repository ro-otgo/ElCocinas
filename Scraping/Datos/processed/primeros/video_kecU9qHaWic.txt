a few weeks ago I shared three of my all-time favorite autumn soup recipes and each of the three recipes featured my homemade vegetable stock it turns out you guys are really interested in how to make it so I thought I'd make a video about it today I'm going to show you just how easy it is to make stock from scratch so as far as I'm concerned the base for any great stock is onion celery and carrot now when you're preparing these vegetables you don't even have to worry about peeling them don't worry about a thing because the fact is the vegetables don't stay in the stock we're going to be fishing them all out later so we're just gonna steal as many nutrients as we possibly can from them so I'm starting with some onions some carrots and some celery now I'm barely even chopping these guys because that's how forgiving the stock really is and look that's the base for any great stock now to that you can add any number of fresh herbs my preference though is always a mixture of parsley and fresh thyme I feel like these give the best flavor I'm also going to add a couple cloves of garlic because you get tons of great flavor from garlic before throwing it in don't even worry about mincing it just crack it open and then toss it in with the skin on and what we're going to do is fill a pot and cover our vegetables entirely now another great option when you're making vegetable stock is to use your kitchen scrap I like to use things like the core of a bell pepper broccoli stalks tomato scraps bases of things like celery and cabbage and even onion skins basically I store them all in the freezer and then when I'm ready to make a vegetable stock I dump them right into my pot all of these scraps even though they may not be edible are full of flavor and nutrients so we really want to get the most out of them so they're all gonna go in our pot as well we're gonna give this a stir season it with salt and pepper and then let it simmer away as long as you possibly can and I'm talking one to two hours even three after two or three hours you're gonna have the richest most beautiful vegetable stock you could possibly imagine what I love about homemade stock is you can totally control the sodium level and the kinds of vegetables you add so one of the things I like to do before straining through my fine sieve is to just lift out all of the larger chunks now we don't have to worry about getting rid of these now because we basically taken all of the nutrients out of them and they've been transferred to our incredible bra now if you're wondering why my stock is so rich and darkly colored it's actually because of the onion skins they actually die the stock and all you'll really have to do is strain it with a fine mesh sieve to make sure you're not getting any of the debris into the stock if you wanted it to be extremely fine you could totally also do this through the cheesecloth but I think that looks pretty darn good this nutrient dense stock can be stored in your fridge for up to a week or in your freezer for up to six months and it's ideal for things like these soups or these chilies or even for cooking your quinoa I love it for that and if you want to even take it a step further by making it a chicken or a beef stock you can easily do that by adding some leftover chicken or some beef bones to it and simmering it the exact same way I hope you'll give this stock a try and then it makes your life in the kitchen more delicious be sure to subscribe to my channel and see you next time
