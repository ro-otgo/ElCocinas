hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious is my model and I'm really excited today because I'm doing something my wheelhouse that I love is making soup I love making soup I make it all year long but it is getting close to the fall time and that's a great soup season fall and winter I'm often asked by friends and neighbors how to make soups because I love to make big batches of it and share it with friends family and neighbors well today that's exactly what we're gonna do we're gonna make our own homemade chicken broth and then make a beautiful chicken vegetable soup let's get at it I'm going to show you my version of whipping up a nice chicken broth you know if you don't have four hours I am retired I'm feeling pretty lucky about that and if you don't have four hours to spend don't feel bad if you've got to buy the store-bought chicken broth it's tasty I use it lots of times to get the low-sodium one add your own salt make it your flavor but making soup is like a blank canvas add what you like take out what you don't like it's fun to make soup make it your own let's get to the broth [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you might have noticed I added some tumeric well it was building my chicken broth it has many good health benefits you can read up about it and it also gives the soup a nice rich yellow deep color it's perfect for making your bra try it out you might like it so I have my 4 liters of chicken stock i refrigerated it overnight and when you take it out it's kind of jelly that's exactly what you're looking for the collagen 's and the bones that's where that comes from it turns it to a jelly light that means you've successfully made a good stock if there's a little bit of fat on top you can skim it off but the rest the jelly like is all the goodness so we're starting off with 2 cups of onions finely chopped 2 cups of carrots everything here is finely chopped up this is celery as you can see everything's finely diced that's 2 cups as well one cup of spring onion one cup of frozen peas I find if you use the canned peas they get too mushy so one cup of frozen peas and alternatively with corn I use the canned corn the frozen corn gets mushy I like using canned corn and I love corn in my soup so I'm adding two small cans of corn for our seasoning I've got one tablespoon of poultry seasoning and one tablespoon of oregano 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper now if you're using the store-bought stock you could add some garlic I put some garlic in while I was cooking my stock so that's an option for you now I've got my whole this is about three and a half cups of diced up chicken that I got from my chicken that I cooked in my stock I'm not going to put that in until the last 10 minutes of cooking as well as some greens I have some bok choy here which is a Chinese cabbage you can use spinach so I'm going to put a couple of cups of that in at the end of the cooking the last 10 minutes and if you don't have the chicken ready in the last 10 minutes of cooking the soup you can put in 3 or 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts take them out dice them up into cubes or shred them with a couple of forks back into the soup let's get this on the stove we're gonna bring it to a boil and then let it simmer for a good 40 minutes over to the stove we go our soup spent on now for 40 minutes time to add our chicken [Music] and our bok choi another 10 or 15 minutes and we'll be ready to serve it up [Music] well that was another simple and delicious recipe I hope you get to try this out with your friends and family like I always say get creative make it your own let me know what you think give me a thumbs up you can reply on youtube to me maybe you have some good ideas on how you put your soups together I'd love to hear well now I get to give it a taste [Music] Oh lots of chicken the broth is beautiful lots of veg you're going to love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music]
