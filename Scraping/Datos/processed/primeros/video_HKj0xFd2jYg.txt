[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete some pretty scary times were going through right now I have to self isolate for 14 days I just returned home from Florida but I'm still cooking and today we're doing a marinara sauce it's best to do your own why buy the one that's full of sugar and salt it's simple ingredients and delicious great for freezing you can use it in all sorts of dishes whether it's pasta casseroles or pizza it's a great pizza sauce and this will lead into my next recipe next week which is a spaghetti casserole it's delicious home comfort food anyways let's make some marinara sauce maybe make a little extra for the next-door neighbor let's get to it and be safe out there let's start out with a pot on medium to high heat we'll add one teaspoon of olive oil and then a half a cup of onions finely diced we'll saute them for a minute and we're going to add a clove of garlic finely dice saute that for a minute one 28-ounce can of plum tomatoes two tablespoons of tomato paste 1 teaspoon of oregano 1 teaspoon of basil 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes that's optional 1/2 teaspoon of each salt and pepper I like to use my stick blender to mix up well if you don't have one of those just use a potato masher and then give it a good mix we're gonna cover it and let it simmer on low for 45 minutes stirring occasionally and that's it let it cool you can refrigerate or freeze it up to three to four months or better well that's as simple and delicious as it gets I give it a taste perfect just lovely you're gonna love it well folks take care be safe all the best to you and your families and until next time see ya [Music]
