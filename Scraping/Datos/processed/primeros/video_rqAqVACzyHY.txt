hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete from Florida as you can see things look a little different here than my normal kitchen we have a little place here in Port Charlotte it's on the gulf side of Florida love coming down here all the activities and I love cooking here and at the beach so one of the beaches that we're gonna go to is the Boca Grande it's one of my favorite spots we'll take some charcoal we'll cook these up it'll be delicious what we're doing is stuffed jalapeno peppers cream cheese shrimp wrapped in bacon and then some other ones we'll do some cream cheese chicken pineapple wrapped in bacon and then we'll finish it off with a little barbecue sauce on the grill so let's get to our prep work we have all our ingredients already here to go we're gonna stuff one with chicken let's bone the skinless chicken I put a little bit of barbecue seasoning on it and pineapple both will have cream cheese but the other one will have shrimp and we'll put a little bit of barbecue seasoning on both we're going to fill it with cream cheese wrap it in bacon so this is what you want your jalapeno to look like after you clean out the insides see the end here how I've left it you want to keep that end that keeps all the cheese and goodies inside so you get your jalapeno and you want to cut it lengthwise I've already started cutting this one so you cut it down the center and then you just want to get a spoon and clean out the insides like so you want to cut that little stem off but again remembering not to cut the end off in cream cheese I've got chive and onion and use the back of the spoon I find it's easier to lay it inside get it in there smoothly and you just want to fill it up so it's kind of even to the top like so do one more here like so first we'll do the pineapple and chicken couple pieces of pineapple in the center here and then piece of our boneless skinless chicken right on top and then there are other one will get a shrimp now because the shrimp is always naturally curved like so we'll get a little paring knife just be able to straighten that out like so like that these are deveined and clean but they're raw still so let's put a little bit of barbecue seasoning on the top and then we'll wrap them in bacon just like that you could also fire these in the up if you're fortunate enough to head off to the beach to the barbecue like so and that's it we're all prepped now let's get over to the beach here we are so excited to get here well I'm gonna unpack and get things set up here on the beach [Music] [Music] here we are at Boca Grande I love it here I got the charcoal on next let's get the food on so this is a public beach all these beautiful little huts to sit under - you want some shade and little barbecues at each one just bring your own chair cool what a spot beautiful beach look at that Gulf of Mexico just gorgeous stuffed jalapenos or on the grill I just wanted to show you these these little grill mats that you can buy when you're on a public grill you bring these along cut your cook your food on top a little bit of nonstick spray and then you can just throw these away Wow these doesn't have lids on these charcoal grills so we'll just add live a bit and take my own bed over there got a bit of wind coming off the Gulf so we've got a little weight on there okay it's been about eight minutes I roll them over and then we'll get this lid back on top oh my they're coming along beautiful in about another seven minutes and they're just about done they look delicious how a pineal stuffed with shrimp or over on the tray and then I basted the ones with chicken and pineapple and sweet baby Ray's barbecue sauce they'll be ready in a moment the stuffed a Latinos are off I threw a little man bread on there put a little bit of fresh garlic butter and some cheese on top nice little side thanks for coming out to in the kitchen with Pete here and Boca Grande the best time now is I get to try the food I think first I'll try the shrimp one I made a little cocktail sauce for it we'll dip that in there oh my so good oh sighted potato salad garlic toast thanks for watching my videos we'll get together soon subscribe to my channel or give me a thumbs up thanks for coming up to in the kitchen with Pete see ya you
