[Music] so [Music] hello friends and welcome back to my channel i am so excited for today's video you guys seem to always like this video i think this is the second or third year that i have done it but today we're gonna make some super easy super bowl appetizer recipes and to be honest i don't even know who is in the super bowl this year i'm just here for the commercials and for the food anybody else with me and y'all i have been like so excited to film this video mainly because i cannot wait to eat all of these delicious recipes and share them with you guys so on the menu today we're going to be making some fried cauliflower which is honestly y'all one of my all-time favorite things to eat you have no idea like i love it and i feel like i do not get to eat it often enough so i cannot wait for that we're going to make it just like regular traditional style and we're also going to make it like a buffalo fried cauliflower blue cheese and ranch does it not sound so good affleck is kind of like a fun take on like your normal buffalo chicken dip that you would have at the super bowl we're gonna do it with cauliflower i was gonna say a little bit healthier but it's fried so i don't know if it's actually healthier and they're also gonna make some artichoke spinach dip and this is the best artichokes bench dip oh my gosh it's so good and there is like nothing i like more for any football honestly for any football game than like a warm dip that just sounds so good and then we're also going to be making some airfryer pretzels two different ways as well so i'm gonna flip you guys around and we are gonna get started okay so i like my florets to kind of be bite-sized i don't want them to be too big but i also don't want to be too small but basically you just want to have kind of a little bite-size floret [Music] okay i'm gonna just crack two eggs into my little bowl whisk them together and i'm gonna take a little flour mixture in here and you guys know my usual suspects i'm going to do a little bit of garlic a little bit of flowers and a little bit of ranch seasoning in my bowl and then we'll dredge it in the egg dread it in the flour pop it in the oil [Music] okay first batch is ready to go in and just so you all know mr b loves fried cauliflower just as much as i do like we are so excited to have this it's like it's such a treat i know oh there's just something about it it's just a little bit different but still it's like a potato but better like a french product better absolutely anytime we go to a restaurant that has like buffalo fried cauliflower on the menu i always order it there goes nothing i'm going to let you do the honors i know i think i'm actually going to use a little our little thing here this just seems a little dangerous you know [Music] as i just drop one in [Music] okay that already smells so good i know i cannot wait i cannot wait so we'll just let these go until they're like golden brown and then pop them out put them on a paper towel to kind of get that excess oil off and sprinkle a little bit of sea salt [Music] y'all for some reason i was just doing egg and then flour but monkey reminded me we're supposed to do flour then egg then back in flour it just gets like a better breading on there so if you made these try it that way do these not look so good if y'all have never had fried cauliflower trust me it's like the best little tastiest french fry you'll ever have in your life and i just have some of that like big flaky sea salt so i'm just going to kind of get a little pinch and sprinkle it on top while these are still um like fresh and hot out of there what is your favorite way to eat fried cauliflower because usually i love dipping my french fries in ranch and i like these in ranch but i love the way they taste with ketchup i know you do i am still trying to figure out what my favorite dipping sauce is with fried cauliflower because it is good with ketchup it's so good y'all i can't explain it i don't like it as much with ranch but if we're buffaloing them or at least some of them yeah i think then that will be good with ranch yeah for sure um california pizza kitchen is where i get my fried buffalo cauliflower blue cheese and ranch and oh my gosh it's so good [Music] okay we've already been over here sneaking a couple of bites oh my gosh y'all are going to love these um so this is the first batch that we did not flour egg flour and these are the ones that we did so you can see they just get kind of like a better little breading and crust on there okay so to make these more of like a buffalo fried cauliflower i'm just going to mix together a little bit of this ranch which by the way this is like our new favorite brand of ranch it is so so good we try and get it whenever i want to get one free because it is a little bit more expensive four dollars a jar yeah but so worth it so but it's two dollars on sale yes so i'm gonna mix a little bit of that in my bowl and then add in lots and lots of this frank's red hot mix it together and then drizzle it over top and then add our blue cheese because monkey feels like since they're fried he doesn't want them like dredged in hot sauce so we'll just do kind of like a drizzle [Music] you know how good do these look and of course you could do like some very fancy finely chopped green onion add a little color but oh my gosh can i eat one i'll have a picture for you regular cauliflower which you can dip in anything you want to and then he's going to try our little buffalo i want to try one too little buffalo whoa looks so good i need a bite somewhere in here give me some blue cheese on there yes please oh my gosh i'm i literally almost feel like i'm eating a chicken wing right now i'm telling you it's so good wow that is awesome i need more but i want like a big piece of blue cheese i also eat my fingers no glass and we can dunk it enough leftover i'm gonna just dunk it right in there yeah like michael jordan okay so now it is time to get started on this artichoke spinach dip and i actually made this on a different day so i'm just going to pop it in here but to make this you are of course going to need some spinach some cream cheese garlic sour cream you're also going to need some mozzarella of course some artichokes if you have the ones that are already um half i would still go ahead and kind of cut them up really finely you're also going to need some smoked paprika but we'll talk about that in a second a little bit of cayenne pepper if you so choose to add that in some parmesan cheese and then of course a little bit of salt and pepper i will of course type out this recipe and leave it down below in the description box for y'all but like i was saying you want to kind of give those artichokes a rough chop and then you're just going to add everything to the crock pot this could not be any simpler and if you want to use frozen spinach you totally can do that just let it thaw first and then kind of wring out any of that excess water and that spinach will wilt down so don't be afraid you can add lots more if you want to and as far as the smoked paprika goes i felt like my mom used to add that in whenever she would bake this when i was a little girl i'm gonna have to ask her because now i'm not sure if she did or not bunkie said he didn't love the smoked paprika in there it still was absolutely delicious but he said he could do without it so you guys can decide if you want to add it in or not but like i said this recipe will be down below in the description box but now we are going to get started on these incredible super easy airfryer pretzels so like i said the next recipe is gonna be these airfryer pretzels and y'all this could not be any easier like this is probably the most simple recipe you will ever make and you can do so many different things with this you can make these however you want i'm going to do them two different ways so one way is going to be more savory with like butter garlic cheese you could also add pepperoni you could add whatever you want to them and then the other way i'm going to do is sweet with like cinnamon sugar you look at super bowl parties that there's like a lot of desserts i think there's never like a lot of desserts at super bowl party certain options are very always minimal right so this is gonna be like an easy way to kind of like slip something sweet in there i feel like when you get to the super bowl you get like chocolate chip cookies for real maybe uh bat cake maybe this is just an actionable party i don't know but i feel that way too so i'm like i need to do something that's a little bit more sweet as well and all you need to do this is a roll of pizza dough like literally this could not get easier they take five minutes in the air fryer um so i guess i'm gonna do the other ones with like the butter and garlic and cheese and then once those are done we'll make the dessert by the way i got the inspiration for this recipe out of my air fryer cookbook i know i've showed this to you guys before but i will link it down below i love paris she actually like follows me here and watches some of our videos she is so sweet and she actually wrote this cookbook and it is fantastic so i will link it down below for you okay [Music] i told you i really didn't think this board is gonna be big enough but watch bae you ready see we're gonna do hmm okay let's get the other one transferring okay so now that we've got our dough situated in our cutting board he's just gonna take our pizza cutter and just make strips in here we're gonna try and do like eight so we can have four savory and four sweet but we'll see how many we can make so you just go ahead i'm gonna cut it um in half to start that way we have an even right uh-huh and then we're going to go half here and then half here [Music] our minds are so different because i would have never done this yeah but now they're very even yeah this is smart this is good okay so to this melted butter i'm gonna add in some parmesan cheese you know that's good okay i'm gonna add in some garlic oh funky supposed to use a spoon for my garlic oh really i guess i'll just dump it oh no let me get another spin okay i'm adding a little bit of ranch seasoning of course i mean why not you don't like garlic oh that's probably good okay and then a little bit of um you just sprinkle this on top after they come out yeah no no before you put them in oh okay okay wow that is a delicious little i know it's gonna be so good okay so you need to get twisting on our pretzels all right i just taught monkey the technique let's see if you remember it my only thing is like are you sure you want to leave them flat let me just do it no but i'm saying like you don't want to like roll them a little bit and make them like round and when you just like pick it up u-shape and twist see oh it's like the old loop swoop and pull yes this is clean right yeah [Music] okay so now we're just gonna brush our little mixture right on top of these then i'll sprinkle on the um cheddar cheese as well as like some flaky salt and we'll pop them in the airfryer do okay so we're going to pop them in our airfryer basket and then 350 for five minutes [Music] when you're ready because i'm ready to heat imagine we're rolling oh my goodness gracious look at how puffy though look look it hold on you'll have to see it you cannot you cannot i know what you're gonna the height but is that one yours oh yeah that is the one that i made i was like i know you want to say that yours looks prettier than mine that one looks pretty good dude bunky wow and b was like saying how he was like there is no way these are gonna be done in five minutes and they're literally perfect yeah that's wild and you can totally like um heat up some marinara mm-hmm and like dunk these in marinara or add like pepperoni to these like pizza pretzels yes there's so many ways you could make this is uh just opened up a a wild uh idea of thoughts i cannot wait i mean can we just take a look at these things i wish y'all could smell them see them in real life like look at that oh my gosh these are gonna be so good [Music] wow these are gonna be pretty that one's really pretty too okay so this time to our melted butter i'm gonna add in a little bit of cinnamon and a little bit of sugar and then we'll brush that on [Music] look how pretty those are bunk i know okay five more minutes all right okay so those are done we're gonna take them out and i actually made a little glaze to go on top of these to make them even more delicious this is so easy it's just like powdered sugar a little splash of milk a little bit of vanilla and a little bit of butter and we just made it in the same container that already had the cinnamon sugar in there to give it more sweetness oh my gosh okay pop those bad boys out i wouldn't just like dump my finger in there monkey i'm gonna die you're good check that out oh my gosh i cannot get over how easy and good these are we ate the um other ones yeah they were so good bunkie said for sure he would love like marinara with it i think so too or like a um funky melted cheese oh my gosh of course get you some good old fritos cheese dip oh my gosh monkey these look so good oh i turned that back on [Music] does this not look
