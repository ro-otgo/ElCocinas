hey lovelies I think we can all agree that there is nothing quite like chicken noodle soup to cure what ails EO but I've been looking for tasty ways to spice it up a little bit and I think I found just the thing this asian-inspired take on chicken noodle soup is just as satisfying as the classic and boasts all of the same cold fighting benefits it's basically the Super Heroes it all starts with my soup pot on the stove is all my soup recipes do and I'm just gonna heat up some oil once that oil is nice and hot I'm going to toss in some onion and some thinly sliced red bell pepper we're just going to give these a bit of a head start maybe three to four minutes just to allow them to soften up a little bit next we are going to add in the trifecta of flavor I've got some garlic some red chilies and some freshly grated ginger let me just tell you this if you were feeling under the weather you just double or triple the amount of ginger in this it'll cure what ails you once those have had a nice chance to heat through after maybe a minute we are going to add some curry paste to this curry paste can usually be family in the international aisle at your supermarket it's really just a mixture of wonderful curry spices and flavors but they've already done the work for you by putting it in a paste so it's great to have on hand I always keep some in my refrigerator for an occasion like this I'm also going to add a few splashes of fish sauce if you are vehemently against fish sauce by all means you can leave it out or add some soy sauce or tamari in its place this just adds a little bit of tasty umami flavor that I absolutely love and seems like that once you've got all your flavors built into your pan you can go ahead and add some cooked shredded chicken if you don't want to use chicken here you always have the option to use some shrimp instead or some tofu both would work really really well then we are going to add some coconut milk I'm also going to add some chicken broth to this when it comes to battling colds and flu season I am a big believer that homemade chicken broth is the way to go so if you want to go ahead and make your chicken broth you should definitely check out this video it is really really tasty and I always think absolutely worth the effort once this mixture has come to a boil you can reduce your heat to medium low and let it simmer away for just about five or ten minutes this doesn't take long at all since that chicken has already cooked and you really just want to let those flavors sort of come together and reach their maximum potential at the very end of that simmering process you're going to go ahead and add your noodles in this case I am using some ramen noodles you always have the option to use some rice noodles in this recipe instead I love both of these options because they cook in just two or three minutes so once they're in the pot you're just gonna pop your lid back on let them simmer until they're nice and soft then you can finish this soup off by stirring in some freshly chopped cilantro and the zest and juice of a lime now that my friends is some chicken soup for the soul and for the immune system I hope you will give this tasty recipe a try if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because I always love seeing your kitchen creations be sure to check out all of the other tasty tasty tasty soup recipes in this playlist because I've got a lot of delicious soup recipes and if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more soup deliciousness where this came from
