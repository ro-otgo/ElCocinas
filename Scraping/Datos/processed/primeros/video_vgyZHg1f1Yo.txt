hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete while we're into December now we're just around the corner from Christmas I've been focusing on appetizers and recipes for large groups or what about snacks that brings me to one of my all family favorites I'd like to dedicate this video to my dad it's his chip dip recipe I can remember as a kid gathered around dad the kids sitting by his chair just waiting to get in another dip of dad's famous chip dip let's get to it it's simple it's delicious and it's quick to start off you're going to need 250 grams 1 package of cream cheese which is about 8 ounces I'm gonna use a whole container of sour cream it's about 500ml or 2 cups I've got the non-fat here and the reason I use that it's a little thinner consistency I find it's better for dipping the your chips in it but if you want to use the full fat carry on then I got 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise it was always a big discussion on whether to use Miracle Whip or mayonnaise that's up to you I like to use the Miracle Whip it's got a little tang to it and we're going to put in 1 cup of ketchup and then 3/4 of a cup of finely diced onions as fine as you can dice them up run through them a few times so they're nicely finely diced then we're gonna put 1 teaspoon of garlic powder 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper and 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce now just take your time with this mash it all up use a fork you'll see all those nice little bits of cream cheese throughout that's just what you're looking for well that was another simple and delicious recipe I know you're going to love it the kids to try it out let me know what you think and thanks for subscribing and if you haven't just hit the red subscribe button or give me a thumbs up or both well now I'm going to try the goods oh boy I like to use the ruffle chips oh just like dad used to me well I hope you have a festive season thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with P until next time see ya [Music]
