hey lovelies if you were on the hunt for a wildly flavorful wildly satisfying a but wildly vegan soup option and then today you are in the right place because I am making a big batch of my delicious curried cauliflower soup and once you try it I promise you will not be able to get enough it is just so super tasty super being the operative word of course to really maximize the flavor in this soup we are actually going to start by roasting our cauliflower so I've got a full head of cauliflower cut into florets I'm just going to spread it on a baking sheet I'm also going to roast up some carrots carrots obviously add such a nice sweetness some great body to this soup I'm going to drizzle on a little olive oil season this all with some salt and pepper and then sprinkle on a good helping of curry powder now I'll be honest I love to use lots of curry powder in a recipe like this in fact I could be guilty of getting a little curried away we're going to get these into a preheated oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for maybe 20 minutes or so or until they're nice and soft and golden as this all roast in the oven we're going to get some really nice caramelization which is going to add to the sweetness and we are also going to maximize the flavor of our curry powder so there's a lot to love about this now that our cauliflower and our carrots are all roasty-toasty we are going to turn our attention to building more flavor into the base of our soup I've got a nice big soup pot happening on the stove and to that I'm going to add a little oil once that oil is hot you can get your onions into the pan you can also get some minced garlic into the pan once those onions have had a chance to heat up we can go ahead and add some ginger into the mix you don't have to add a ton just a little bit of freshly grated ginger it can really add something to a soup like this then I'm going to get all of my bed Gees into my pot and top everything off with a can of coconut milk and some vegetable broth like I said we are keeping this recipe completely so using veg broth is great once the soup is getting simmering we can just hit it with a little more salt and pepper bring everything to a boil and then reduce your heat to medium pop the lid on your pot and let everything cook away for 15 or 20 minutes you really want to make sure that your cauliflower and your carrots are completely soft because our next step is actually going to be blending up this soup to do that we are going to of course turn the heat off on our stove and then we are going to use an immersion blender I love my immersion blender it comes in so handy in the kitchen in fact I probably should have added it to my kitchen essentials video that I heard two weeks ago because I loved it that that much you can use your immersion blender to get everything silky silky smooth and then it is ready to be enjoyed I love serving it with a dollop of coconut yogurt for some richness and some creaminess and a little bit of fresh cilantro guys this recipe is seriously good I hope you will give it a try if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because I love seeing your kitchen creations keep in mind that I've got loads of other great soup recipes on the channel you can check them out in my soup playlist and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe and hit that notification belt because there is lots more soup deliciousness with this game crap
