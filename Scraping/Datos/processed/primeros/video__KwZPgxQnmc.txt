here come join us in the kitchen today get cozy and comfy we're gonna have a lot of fun and make all kinds of yummy goodness so let's get to cooking okay so for this first one we are making a Cheesy taco dip in the crock pot y'all already know this is gonna be so good and the best part about this one is there's only five ingredients okay so of course you're gonna need your crock pot and I'm just using my little mini baby once a day you're also gonna need a jar of salsa whichever one is your favorite will work and then you're gonna need some ground beef taco seasoning some cream cheese and then some velveet and of course I'm not using this entire thing I'll probably only use like half of it but you'll need the Velveeta and to get started we're going to go ahead and just Brown our beef [Music] so once you've got your ground beef cooked and drained go ahead and add that to your crock pot and I did go ahead and lightly grease this by the way so next we're going to add in one packet of taco seasoning now we're going to add in our salsa I'm only doing half a block of cream cheese if you want to put the entire Block in there by all means and last but not least is our Velveeta [Music] and give this a good stir I probably should have stirred that taco seasoning into that meat before I put all this cheese in here but you live and you learn okay so I have my crock pot on high I'm gonna pop a lid on here and it will cook for about two to three hours okay so it's been about an hour let's check on this dip it is bubbling away in here and y'all it smells so good oh my gosh do you see this cheesy creamy goodness wow I could like take a deep dive into this okay I'm gonna give it like 30 more minutes and it'll probably be about done okay I'm ready I've got my chips I am ecstatic to try this dip I know it's gonna be so good but you can downstairs and he's like what is this goodness about to eat I'm like cheesy taco dip and he said oh yeah I need some of that like right now so let's taste test this okay first let's just like check in on this goodness and give it a stir oh my gosh do you see this do you see the magic this is what you call Magic blend that magic up wow like y'all I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful sight and I think it's such a good change up to like everyone's normal like sausage cheese dip Rotel yeah it's like a good cheesy dip but different yeah you just keep talking about it and maybe I'll get to try it at some point how about it I'm Gonna Let You Go first oh fun the perfect vessel here I got this Scoops because I know I was making this dip and I was like you have to have a Scoops you know oh yeah oh yep [Music] [Laughter] that is very good I can't wait to try it so much different than your standard sausage Rotel cheese dip can you taste the taco seasoning in there oh those were for me but oh my goodness I just can't get up for the beauty of it yeah I don't think you can really see the actual color of it too well on the camera oh wow they're salsa in there too that is legit that's legit oh my gosh wow that is awesome wow well I know it's not eating for dinner tonight yeah I will literally like I'm not you know what pairs well with this what sweet tea flavor this dip is incredible like you can taste that taco seasoning but it's almost like intensified and that salsa y'all you 100 hands down have to make this recipe you will thank me I promise and your family will it is so good okay so for these next two recipes it is all about cheesy goodness and actually one of you guys sent me this first recipe you were like you gotta make this and I said you are right this is gonna be so much fun and so cute we are going to make a pumpkin cheese ball and there are so many different variations of ways that you can do this but let me show you what I'm going to put in mine all right so I've got my cream cheese and this has been sitting out for a little while because you want it to be room temperature so it's really easy to stir everything in and get it nice and combined I'm gonna add a little bit of chopped jalapeno to mine if you don't like spice of course you can leave that out and then I did go ahead and trade my cheese and I use like the little smaller attachment that has like thinner shreds because I think this is what's going to make our pumpkin look really good so I have all of my cheddar cheese there I have some real bacon pieces some ranch seasoning Auntie no nose and some Parmesan now you could do like Pome Mentos in here or like spinach and artichokes and kind of make like an artichoke spinach cheese ball you could do lump crab meat olives like whatever your hearts desire you guys know these are just like our favorite things so we're gonna go ahead and get all of this in our bowl and get it combined [Music] and by the way I will show you how we're going to actually make this look like a pumpkin trust the process okay so I'm only using a very little bit of jalapeno and I basically minced it like I cut it as small as I possibly could and I'm just doing a little bit because I don't want it to be overpowering but I want just like that little bit of kick in there so we're going to toss that in and then I'm gonna do like half of this cheese inside the cheese ball then we're going to cover it with the rest of the cheese hence making it look like a pumpkin laughs [Music] Hey listen sometimes you just gotta get in there with your hands to work okay so here's where this gets really fun we're gonna take our cheese ball and put it on a plate and put all of that extra cheese around it cover it so that it looks orange like a pumpkin and I'm going to show you how we're going to make it look even more like a pumpkin let me take my rings off keep it clean keep it clean keep it clean okay okay make sure it's like nice and round a good little perfect size ball and then just start pressing this extra cheese into it [Music] once you've got your cheese ball covered in your extra cheese we're gonna take our plastic wrap and we're going to cover this pumpkin and then we are going to take some string and make little indentions so it really looks like a pumpkin okay so take your cheese ball put it in the center of your plastic wrap and just kind of wrap it up nice and tight [Music] and then now for the fun part you are going to take rubber bands hair ties don't worry these are brand new never been used string twine whatever you have and we are going to wrap this while it sits up in the fridge so that there's like little indentions just like a pumpkin if you have a string you probably want something a little bit thinner than this that's why I'm not using this twine and you would just like start underneath let me start and show you kind of like wrap around keep going underneath wrap you get the picture and then you would sit in the fridge like this but I am going to use hair ties Maybe [Music] okay just like so so I'm gonna pop this in the fridge for about four hours now once we take that out in a couple of hours it is still not done we have finishing touches it is going to be so adorable and if you are having a party this is like the perfect thing to add to your table to make it look really festive but also delicious and it's just going to add so much character to like your little tablescape so anyway while that is in the fridge we're gonna go ahead and get started on this third recipe and let me just tell you I feel like I may have saved the best for last although I don't even know if I can say that because yesterday that dip was so good we're making another dip and I think this one is going to be equally as delicious so we are making a Korean corn cheese dip friends oh my goodness it's going to be so good and this is all of the ingredients you need like could not be more simple so of course fresh corn I am going to go ahead and just kind of cut this off of the cob you'll need some mozzarella some mayo some green onion salt and pepper so I'm going to do pepper and little into your nose just to give it a little extra flavor and then some sugar that is it so let me go ahead and get this corn prepped and then we'll kind of put everything together [Music] okay so I've got all my corn in my bowl and I did three pieces of corn and then to this I'm gonna add some sugar of course you make however much you need for your get together I'm gonna do it's a tablespoon a little pitch more because why not and then mayonnaise okay that's probably like three tablespoons of mayonnaise and then our chocolate black pepper Fancy no nose mozzarella cheese okay stir this all together and if you like green onions of course you can just chop yours up and put it in this mixture and bake it but since I don't I'm just going to top ours so I can kind of eat around it but bunky can still enjoy it and you want to have your oven preheating to 400 and then you're going to need like a baking dish so I'm going to use my cast iron skillet you use whatever dish you want and if you're not doing a cast iron skillet just make sure that you lightly grease yours before you dump everything in [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so here's the best part we are only going to bake this for 10 minutes until all of that cheese is melted and that corn softens just a little bit then we'll pop it under the broiler for two minutes and this will be ready so in like 15 minutes all together you've got the most incredible corn dip okay so it's been 10 minutes let's check in on this thing see how it's looking oh my gosh so good okay I'm gonna put another Broiler for two minutes okay I don't think y'all are ready for this wow [Music] okay I'm gonna try and taller tube I have a mouthful of this dip I'm trying to get a mouthful of the depth hands down bumping one of my favorite dips of all time tell me you like this dip better than the other cheese dip they're so completely different and the other one was amazing as well but you know how much I love corn yeah and it's like sweet oh my gosh funk you gotta try it sweet and cheesy yes just absolute amazing goodness well thank you for putting a little oh you're supposed to kind of put those in the [Music] they would be real good cooked into it throughout imparting that delicious onion flavor I understand hmm it's crazy it's crazy that's like the trifecta what it's sweet salty and savory yes all of it monkey you don't understand I'm obsessed I cannot stop eating it that is good y'all you have to make this okay trust me you have to make this if you love corn obviously it's got the juice it's got the juice if y'all know you know I do like a sweet pop of corn in there with with the cheese yes and then I think you said there's some sugar in there you can kind of kind of get a little bit of that sweetness too so that's like the curry mayonnaise yes it takes a kale corn popcorn funky it's crazy yeah not good okay I am not staring y'all wrong with this one I know I tell you to try lots of things and I'm telling you everything that I tell you is so good but I am telling y'all this it is like one of my favorites ever I'm not even joking hands down obsessed and it was the most simple thing in the whole wide world to make you have to try it okay listen Okay so our cheese ball has just like a little bit longer but he's not gonna have that as like a little appetizer to our dinner tonight so I will finish sharing that with y'all here in just a little bit you know what I thought about what I thought about putting the rest of that Jalapeno in there you did it would be good and wouldn't it that was a good thought yeah okay it is pumpkin cheese ball time and I am pumped it is the most beautiful day here today the most amazing Breeze it feels like cool and crisp outside so

gorgeous funky you're so good this is so cute and of course I have my little pumpkin plate here okay but we're not done like I told y'all we still have the Finishing Touch here so get you a bell pepper it can be any color it doesn't matter because all we need is the green stem I wouldn't go with orange though no or just using the stem or maybe you should go with orange oh you see yeah okay hang on oh I get it now oh you get it yeah okay now cut all this around here all but we're not gonna waste it because you can actually use all of this cut it into strips and use this to dip into your
