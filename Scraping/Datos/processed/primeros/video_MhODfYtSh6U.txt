hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete back here in Boca Grande on the Gulf side of Florida one of my favorite beaches and what a special day it is today I got my buddy Gus here hi folks Gus and I started the fire hall together back in 1987 we always loved to cook and hang out we've been buddies ever since and it's a real treat here to have them today because today the star of the show is oysters three different ways we've done a little bit of research Gus what can you tell me about the oysters we're using we got today are called see they're from Cedar Key which is on the gulf side of florida up in the northern part of florida up near the panhandle and they're a very briny oyster we toss them the other day and they were delicious I'm looking forward to trying some today all right well first maybe you could describe to us how we're gonna shuck well sit down here and we'll open up a few and you can walk us through it you happy to do that sounds good all right we've got one of our Cedar Key oysters we picked up from our local fishmonger here in the area most important tool is your shucking knife it's important to have a good firm blade some of them are flimsy this one has a guard on it which is added protection and you'll see on Easter's as they come up to the tip here you'll find a purchase point you can see where the top and the bottom shell meet together so I like to use a thick towel put that over top of the oyster and you give it your shucking knife in there and you start to work it in or get in and the top should just pop right off you run your shucking knife along the top of the oyster and remove the top piece of the top of the shelf you get inside here and you have to remove the oyster from the muscle and that's freed up and then you're free to add your favorite ingredients to it whether it's hot sauce lemon juice horseradish or maybe you just like to go at raw and you can just slide that right in your mouth well Gus great job shucking those oysters thanks Pete you know before we enjoy these I'd like to give a little shout-out to our pals back at the Burlington fire department hopefully everybody's well working safely and we wish we were there we do miss you but Ernest it's so warm here let's give me the world I like to try my I like to do mine with just a squeeze of lemon okay the lemon and I'm gonna add a little bit of hot sauce on mine Texas Pete hot sauce oh boy good stuff Cheers cheers buddy hmm those are nice oh my nice and briny my saltiness to them mm-hmm they tend to the Gulf Coast tends to produce briny oysters but those are delicious fantastic well let's get on to our next two oysters okay for our grilled spicy hoisters the sauce that we're doing we're gonna start out with a quarter pound of butter better known as a stick and then we're gonna have some finely diced onions here I'm gonna throw in a couple of tablespoons this is just a teaspoon that I measure this so there's a couple of tablespoons in there and we're gonna add some fresh lime about a half of a lime the juice from half of a lime lots of good flavors here I think the lemon and the butter the onions just work so well together now here's an interesting item I have here I have some smoked turkey sausage and what I've done is they sauteed it up quickly in a cast-iron pan and two little finely diced pieces so we'll sprinkle that around in our sauce that will absorb all these flavors and then last but not least we're gonna add some hot sauce and again this is your choice put as much as you want in it I'm putting quite a bit in this this is almost like what you would do if you're doing a buffalo chicken sauce but even amounts of butter even amounts of hot sauce and again to your taste try it out see what you like we're gonna let that sit in there and simmer for about a half an hour so all those flavors come together meanwhile Gus has got the charcoal lon now let's get to our next sauce for our garlic butter grilled oysters it's kind of a two-stage process we're gonna start off with a little bit of butter it's gonna help mix the next few ingredients together we've got some finely diced shallots we're gonna put in all about two tablespoons this is just a teaspoon I'm using so but four of those should be about two tablespoons and next we've got our thick-cut double smoked bacon I've already saut√©ed this up and then cut it into little tiny pieces like bacon bits so we'll let all those flavors mix nicely together then what we're gonna do is we want to place that on top of our raw oyster it's gonna be delicious let's get over to the growing see if Gus's got that charcoal ready okay we've got our two sauces here Pete prepared a little bit earlier I just shuck eight oysters fresh out of the cooler aren't there been on ice and we're gonna start a little bit of a spicy the spicy oyster a little bit eat on each one and then the bacon and shallots I'm gonna put on the other four then we're going to finish these ones up with some garlic butter fresh farm and a squeeze of lemon they're all ready let's get them on the grill Pete we've got some garlic butter over here and tell you how hot this grill is a garlic butter is sizzling so let's keep them separated because we're going to drizzle some some of the garlic butter over top [Music] these have been on for about five or six minutes you can see that are
