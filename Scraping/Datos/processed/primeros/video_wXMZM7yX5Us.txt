[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious is my theme and we're certainly following that today three items asparagus prosciutto and cream cheese this is an excellent appetizer or a side to any meal I used to do it with just asparagus and prosciutto and a buddy of mine moe hey moe he says you got to try it with cream cheese I've been doing it ever since you're gonna love it well put these together whip them out in the barbecue we're down here in Florida it's easy and sunny and beautiful so why not go outside and do it let's put these together so make sure your asparagus is cleaned and we don't want to eat this end the gnarly end so you're gonna both 3/4 away through you just kind of bend it and it breaks very easily apart you can do a couple at a time well 3/4 the way down bend and it just snaps discard these and we'll use those it's that easy I've got my prosciutto laid out sometimes when your prosciutto comes out of the package it may not come out easily may come out in two pieces like this one not to worry lay them down beside each other it will tighten up when you're cooking it spread a little bit of cream cheese I like to use a spoon I'm using chive and onion here gives it a little extra flavor and just use the tip of your spoon kind of gently spread it along like so do the last one here now I like to start at this end and put it on a slight angle so when you're rolling it up it will work its way towards the bottom and then that way you cover more of your asparagus like so cover it up then we're going to take these out to the barbecue they don't take long at all medium to high heat maybe about 10-15 minutes so I've got several of them prepped like so don't they look delicious let's get out to the barbecue okay we're putting the prosciutto-wrapped asparagus on the grill we just want to brown those up I don't want to get that asparagus too soft I want it still with a little bit of a crunch we'll roll those over several times till they get all nicely browned up and the prosciutto wraps around it nicely so they're starting to brown up nicely now we're gonna give them the rollover coming along nice oh my aren't they looking delicious I think it's about time to take them off and play them up there they are all plated up don't they look delicious [Music] [Applause] hey folks there's another simple and delicious recipe completed if you like my videos log in to YouTube and hit the red subscribe button you'll be notified when I come up with a new video every Monday these took about eleven minutes on the barbecue medium to high heat you can also do those in the oven 400 degrees about the same time roll them over halfway well the best time is now I get to try the goods they look delicious Oh all mine you're gonna love them until next time thanks for coming out food in the kitchen with Pete see ya [Music] [Applause]
