hello lovelies sweater weather is finally upon us which also means it's time for soup season and today I've got three delicious soup recipes for you all of which contain just five ingredients and comes together in under 30 minutes so these are perfect for weeknight cooking first on today's menu is an absolute classic we're making the simplest chicken soup you can imagine I know it's hard to believe that chicken soup can be made with just five ingredients but it really is super simple to do I'm starting as I often do with my handy Dutch oven on the stove if you don't have a Dutch oven go ahead and use a soup pot instead become soup season I do always recommend investing in a Dutch oven I'll link a few in the description box below if you want to take a look for one we're gonna start with a little oil in the bottom of our pot if you've watched some of my other five ingredient videos before you know that oil salt and pepper don't count as ingredients in my world once the oil is nice and heated up over medium-high heat I am going to add the trifecta of flavor perfection when it comes to chicken soup some onion and some celery and some carrots now a little word to the wise the thinner you chop your celery and your carrots the faster your soup is gonna cook so I highly recommend going for a nice fine chop on those and then you'll have super on the table in less than 20 minutes what's not to love about that I'm gonna let these veggies cook up stirring them often until they start to soften and then it's time to add my final two ingredients which have just some cooked shredded chicken I used a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket but any leftover chicken will do and some chicken broth how easy it was that I'm not gonna pretend that this soup wouldn't be better with a little fresh thyme fresh parsley some garlic maybe but this is at its heart the base of any classic chicken soup so in just five ingredients you have a hearty soup I think your whole family is going to love we're gonna bring this mixture to a boil and as soon as it reaches a boil we'll reduce our heat to medium low and let it simmer away for between 15 and minutes or just until those carrots in the celery have softened up and are nice and tender and then this deliciousness is ready to enjoy you can season it simply with a little salt and a little pepper and get it on the table in no time flat the best part about this is of course your house now smells like chicken soup and that my friends is good for the soul next up for something a little more exotic we are going to be making eight high pumpkin soup of course pumpkin is super seasonal this time of year and I love using it in savory recipes just as much as I like using it in sweet recipes for this recipe I am using pumpkin puree you can usually find this canned in the baking aisle at your supermarket there's usually two different kinds of those so pay close attention one is pumpkin pie filling that comes already sweetened and spiced for pumpkin pie the other is pure pumpkin and that's what we want to use in this soup once your pumpkin is in the pot you can go ahead and add your Thai red curry paste which I absolutely love because it's already got a ton of amazing flavors combined in one single ingredient so you've got lots of garlic lots of ginger lots of chili flavor tons of deliciousness a little of this stuff goes a long way it's super flavorful and then I am adding some red chillies now if you're not into the heat you can always leave these out and swap in a little extra ginger instead it's never a bad thing but you guys know how I feel about all that good heat once that yummyness is in the pan we're going to finish it off with our liquids I have 1 cup of coconut milk netted in here and some chicken broth these are two absolute pantry staples in my household I always recommend having both in abundance in your pantry just standing by for this sort of cooking if you want to swap in some vegetable broth instead of chicken broth here totally up to you this is a really versatile dish we're basically going to give all of this a good stir and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat while we're bringing this mixture to a simmer we'll just get it hit with a little salt and pepper and then once we've got that seasoned up we'll reduce our heat to medium-low and let this simmer for maybe ten minutes or so we're really just giving this soup a chance for the flavors to come together and it's as simple as that you can serve it immediately it was some fresh cilantro for garnish what is not to like about this dish guys super soup endless supreme weeknight cooking am I using too many superlatives finally I'm whipping up another absolute go-to soup in my household it is my tomato parmesan soup and once again just five ingredients gets the job done I've got my Dutch oven heating up on the stove to that I'm going to add just a drizzle of oil once my oil is nice and hot I'm going to pop some onions into my pan and let those cook up for three to four minutes or until they're nice and soft then I'm gonna get some garlic into the pot now I am using two cloves of garlic here three four cloves of garlic will definitely work if you're a big garlic fan you can really go for it in this recipe since we have limited ingredients it's important that we get the most out of each and every one of them once that garlic is nice and fragrant we'll go ahead and add our tomatoes to the pot I like San Marzano tomatoes I think they are the best for cooking so if you can find those go ahead and use them we were going to get our Tomatoes into the pot and any of that additional sauce should also get in you don't want to leave any behind and then once our tomatoes are in the pot we can add our chicken broth once it's reached a boil we'll reduce our heat once again to medium low and let it simmer for between 15 and 20 minutes now I'm going to be blending this up using my handy dandy immersion blender so of course it's really important that you turn off the heat first and then you can just get in there and start to break it up I like starting on low to make sure there's no accidental splashes no one needs an accident in the kitchen especially on a busy weeknight you always have the option to leave it a little chunkier if you want to or get it perfectly smooth definitely your call for the finishing touches and a whole lot of extra flavor I am stirring in a heaping helping of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and then I'll season it up with a little salt and pepper and this beauty is ready for serving this soup can be enjoyed immediately with some crusty bread or you can go ahead and store it in your refrigerator for up to four days it makes really wonderful
