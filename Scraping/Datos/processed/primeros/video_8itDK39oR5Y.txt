[Music] hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete this week I'm putting a big ol pot of ham and split pea soup it's gonna be delicious let's get to it for this recipe you can use chicken or vegetable store-bought broth I cooked the smoked ham last night and I'm gonna make some broth out of that I just covered the ham bone with water added some salary onions carrots a little bit of garlic season with salt and pepper after an hour a simmering strain it and you end up with a beautiful broth then I enhance a flavor with a little bit of vegetable base it's called better than bullion it's organic it's delicious I add a teaspoon at a time and it just gives it some great flavor whichever broth you choose to use you'll need about three and a half quarts which is about three and a half liters in a large skillet medium to high heat who's gonna add a teaspoon of butter and a teaspoon of olive oil we're gonna start out by softening up our vegetables well add two cups of chopped onions one and a half cups of diced carrots and two stalks of celery diced up mix well and we'll saute this for about four minutes then we're going to add some garlic two cloves of garlic finely diced add that to our mixture and we'll season with a quarter teaspoon of pepper and a quarter teaspoon of salt add one teaspoon of Italian seasoning saute and mix well for one to two minutes add all the vegetables to our broth and give that a good stir now we'll add our green split peas we'll need 2 pounds of those or about 900 grams now let's add some ham I have 6 cups of diced ham you can see how I've left it nice and chunky add that to the soup bring it to a boil partially cover it with the lid we'll let it simmer for 1 hour on low stirring occasionally while you're stirring occasionally eventually you'll see the peas just break down and melt in all that beautiful bra and all the flavors we have it but look we still have it nice and chunky that's why I call it chunky pea soup a silky broth with all those Peas doesn't that look delicious oh boy pour myself up a cup right now [Music] [Music] well how's that for a simple and delicious recipe ham and split pea soup it tastes so wonderful you're gonna love it now I'm gonna try big chunks ham the aroma Oh outstanding bit of smokiness from the ham the vegetables the broth is understanding you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out or watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya please don't pretend [Music]
