hi lovelies as the temperature outside continues to cool soup season in my house is just heating up and today i've got an absolutely amazing quick and easy soup recipe for you that's perfect for busy weeknights but is sure to please even the pickiest of eaters it's this amazing tomato soup with tortellini parmesan and spinach and it's so super flavorful but really really simple to put together it all starts with a nice big dutch oven heating up on the stove over medium-high heat to that i'm going to add some butter you could use olive oil here instead but you guys know how i feel about my butter and as soon as that butter is completely melted i'm going to go ahead and add some onion to the pot i want to let that onion cook away for two to three minutes just until it starts to soften up and then i can add some garlic to this as well of course because this is italian inspired cooking i am going for it with the garlic i've got three minced cloves here you could go four if you felt so inclined and i'll just let that garlic cook away for another 30 seconds to a minute just to help it reach its maximum flavor potential next i'm going to add some italian seasoning to this now you can use store-bought or homemade here totally up to you i've got a great recipe for homemade italian seasoning if you want to give it a try for yourselves i'll link it in the description box below as soon as that italian seasoning is nice and fragrant we'll go ahead and add a couple tablespoons of flour to this so the flour is really going to help thicken up this soup and make it nice and rich and creamy but i just want to cook off that floury flavor for 30 seconds to a minute stirring it constantly and as soon as that's happened i'm going to go ahead and add my wet ingredients to the pot so i've got some diced tomatoes here you could use plain or fire roasted which are my preference these days i'm also adding some chicken broth to this veggie broth would be a great substitute and finally i'm going to add some tomato paste here tomato paste has a really incredible concentrated tomato flavor that is perfect in a tomato soup like this really really tasty i highly recommend it and basically all we need to do at this point is give this a quick stir and then bring it to a boil as soon as it's reached to boil we're going to go ahead and add our tortellini to this now here i am using some fresh tortellini that you find in the deli aisle at your supermarket you could also swap in some frozen here instead if you wanted to i'm using cheese tortellini but chicken or beef tortellini would work really well in this recipe and basically as soon as your tortellini is in the pot you can go ahead and reduce your heat to medium medium-low and let it simmer for just 8 to 10 minutes that's really all it takes for the tortellini to cook through and become nice and tender and of course you'll notice that that broth has really thickened up and becomes super super decadent that means it's time to add my finishing ingredients so to this i'm going to add a nice big splash of cream you can skip the cream if you want to but i really think it adds a lot to the richness of this dish i'm also going to be adding a nice heaping helping of freshly grated parmesan cheese to this so you get that beautiful savory umami flavor and i'll also be seasoning this with some salt and some pepper to taste as soon as that parmesan is fully incorporated in the soup the final step is just adding some greens to this i'm using baby spinach here you could also use kale if you wanted to and i'm just going to stir it until it's completely wilted which always takes about a minute or so and honestly guys that is it in under 20 minutes this soup is on the table and you are in dinner heaven it is super super flavorful and your entire family is sure to devour it like mine does i really hope you guys love this recipe as much as i do and that you'll give it a try in your own kitchens if you do be sure to tweet me instagram me or facebook me a photo because you know how much i love seeing your kitchen creations this recipe like all of our recipes is featured on healthymealplants.com our amazing meal planning site that allows you to browse more than a thousand recipes drag and drop them into your weekly meal plan and then automatically generates your grocery list for the week so you can take it straight to the supermarket how great is that finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe because there is lots more deliciousness where this came from
