hi folks welcome to in the kitchen with Pete it's a special day today it's family day I have my son Dawson behind the camera if Kelly she helped us out doing all sorts of dicing and slicing and organizing and I have my daughter here Shay to help me cook she loves mussels we've cooked them lots of times one of your favorites right so she's gonna give me a hand at the stove before we get there I just want to mention a couple of things about my mussels haha my mussels we got Pei mussels it's about two pounds you can buy them in your local grocery store I've checked them all over they're all closed that's important before you cook them all closed before you cook them all open when you're finished cooking them now typically when you find these at the grocery store you'll see that they're all cleaned up nicely if you find the odd one which I did you got this little kind of beard thing on it just take a little knife and snip it off it's that simple so let's get cooking okay let's get our sauce going Shay let's start out with about 1/4 cup of butter and then we got about 4 finely diced cloves of garlic 85 I like garlic but as much as you like in our pans about medium heat and let's put a cup of wine in there let's stir that garlic around a little bit first we'll get that warmed up nicely beautiful now we're going to add a cup of wine you know what a cup is the EDD oh that looks pretty good maybe a little over a cup but that's okay we're gonna let the Lola beautiful okay now we'll get to our next items now we want to add our 1 cup of diced onions and next we're going to add 1 cup of diced celery and next we're going to add 1 cup of finely chopped cilantro cilantro is optional if you're not a fan of cilantro don't put it in and next step we're gonna put in a teaspoon of finely chopped up chili flakes thanks Shay and a couple of sprigs of thyme let's let's mix that all up beautiful okay we're gonna add the juice of 1/2 a lemon next we're gonna add our 28-ounce can of san marzano tomatoes if you're gonna use tomato folks use good ones these have the best flavor their plum tomatoes from Italy 28-ounce can of san marzano tomatoes now here is my little secret recipe my secret item to this is I put in a cup of Clamato juice it just intensifies the flavors and I love lots of juice so when you're finished cooking your muscles it's like a soup I serve it with a spoon we've brought our sauce up to a boil so now let's put the top on partially and we'll let that simmer it'll reduce some of the water moisture in there and just intensify our flavors before we put our mussels in our sauce is simmered for about 30 minutes you can see it's reduced by a whole inch in our pot so let's get our mussels in now the mussels are only going to take four or five minutes I had a little bit of parsley in the fridge so we'll throw that out it'll give it some nice color we're gonna close that lid up we'll turn the heat up a bit to around medium-high close the lid and we'll check on them in about four or five minutes here for four and a half minutes oh yeah look at that they're all opened up we're gonna play them up folks muscles are all cooked up and I just wanted to show you one option that you can use all that beautiful juices and the muscles all I did was throw some fettuccine in there and some fresh parm what a beautiful meal that would be Shay let's get into these mussels and give them a whirl I got some nice fresh garlic bread for dippers gotta have it so good you're gonna love it Jay thanks for all your help Cheers folks I hope you enjoyed my videos if you do press the like button down below or so hit the subscribe button and you'll get my weekly videos I put one out every Tuesday thanks for visiting in the kitchen with Pete see ya
