hi lovelies i am so glad you're here because today i am sharing my family's new favorite dinner recipe it is this absolutely incredible creamy tortellini soup it's quick it's easy it's super flavorful and also super filling plus it is totally child approved at least according to elle and it's become such a hit in our household that we're literally having it once a week at least to get started i have got a nice big pot heating up on the stove and i'm just going to add some oil to that and just as soon as that oil is nice and hot i'll go ahead and add some mild italian sausage to the pot now this is actually some mild italian turkey sausage something that i have been loving these days but if you wanted to use traditional pork sausage in this recipe you definitely could you could also opt for hot italian sausage instead or opt for just some ground chicken in this recipe it's really really versatile so whatever you prefer you can definitely use you also have the option to leave the meat out of this recipe entirely if you wanted to totally up to you and once my sausage is in the pan i'm just going to go ahead and use my spoon to break it up into little bits i want to cook it until it's no longer pink the good news is the sausage takes almost no time to cook as soon as your sausage is fully cooked through you can start to add the rest of your ingredients so first up i have got some onion headed in here as well as some nice thinly sliced carrot we're gonna let those cook up with the sausage for another say three or four minutes just until they start to soften and then i'm also going to be adding some minced garlic to this as well as a good helping of italian seasoning i'm using store-bought italian seasoning here but if you wanted to make your own i have a great recipe for homemade italian seasoning that i will link in the description box below it's really really easy to make and then you always have some on hand in your pantry and just as soon as that garlic and that italian seasoning becomes nice and fragrant which takes no time at all we're going to go ahead and add a few tablespoons of flour to this and the flour is just going to help things thicken up a little bit and give us a nice rich creamy texture in our soup i like to go ahead and let my flour cook for another 30 seconds to a minute just to sort of work off that floury taste pretty simple so far right trust me guys i am all about keeping things simple in the kitchen right now this one has been keeping me up all night and so uh the less effort i spend in the kitchen the happier i am next we're gonna go ahead and add our broth i'm using a nice chicken broth here we're just going to go ahead and add that to our pot and let it cook until our broth comes to a good boil so just as soon as you start to see those bubbles breaking the surface you can go ahead and add your tortellini to this so i'm using some fresh cheese tortellini you could use frozen tortellini in this recipe absolutely it would totally work here um what i love about it would totally work here what i what i love about using tortellini in a recipe like this is that it cooks in no time literally four or five minutes in this nice hot broth and it's going to be perfectly tender and ready to be enjoyed now that our pasta is fully cooked through there are only a few more steps before we get to enjoy this amazing soup first up we want to add some richness and some creaminess to this and i'm going to do that with some cream now you also have the option to use milk in this recipe but i find the cream really adds a ton of beautiful richness here so that's what i'm using at this point you'll want to season it up with a little salt and a little pepper to taste and the final step is just going to be stirring in some greens because of course we could all use more greens in our life today i'm using a heaping helping of baby spinach i'm just going to get it all into my pot and give it a good stir until it's totally wilted which only takes about a minute or so and at this point guys this yumminess is ready to be devoured and trust me devoured is exactly what it's going to be when your family gets to it come on guys tell me this wasn't one of the easiest soups i've ever made here on the channel but also one of the most delicious looking and smelling for that matter it smells incredible in here i
