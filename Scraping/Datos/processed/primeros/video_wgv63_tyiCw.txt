[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today I'm here with my friends Mike and Tina pop they were in a catering business and well in Ontario Niagara and the surrounding area if you're looking for some good eats and you want to hire them I'll put their number up on the screen today or doing their homemade egg yolk ravioli it's outstanding we're gonna put a brown butter and sage sauce on top we're gonna start out with showing you a little bit about the pasta now they've rolled out their own pasta but I want to give you some options you can use a roller or you can roll it out by hand or you can use a wonton wrapper now you have to thin it out but they work beautifully saves a lot of time now we're gonna use some ricotta filling in these as well so we're gonna get Tina up to bat and put it together let's get to it if you're making your own pasta you'll just need 2 eggs 1 cup of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and if it's a little too dry just add a teaspoon of water whether you're making your own pasta or using a long Tong wrapper they must be rolled out paper thin I was pleasantly surprised how well the long Tong wrappers worked okay so we're going to be making ravioli and we're going to be piping the ricotta spinach mixture onto the ravioli pasta shells and then filling them with a raw egg yolk covering up and then boiling them so this is what we do we've got your ricotta and it's 1 cup of ricotta mixed in and we're going to add to that 3/4 of a cup of Parmesan as well get that in there and then I've taken 6 ounces of frozen spinach thawed it squeezed it dry and chopped it fine it's just easier to pipe that way once it's chopped fine and I'm gonna zest some lemon in there get the salt and pepper and the lemon is basically to your taste you can put as little or as much in as you like I prefer a lot of lemon myself and we're gonna add one egg to that mixture and you can add a little freshly grated nutmeg okay give it a good mix and then we're gonna put it in a piping bag or you can use the easiest thing a ziplock bag cut a little slit in the bottom and you're ready to pipe and that's it okay so now we've got our ricotta mixture in our piping bag in our freezer bag and we're just gonna snip the corner but we've got our fresh made pasta here ready to go with our pasta we use two sizes of rings one to mark out the diameter of the ravioli and a center ring just to mark our piping area for the ricotta mixture okay I'm gonna cut the bag now and we're gonna start piping and you want to keep in the circle and you want to go high enough so you have a so the egg sits right inside you may have to do a little fixing here with each one to get it the proper height you want to keep it tight as well so it's not so so big [Music] want to make sure you have an even space even height so when you your aide cracks in it doesn't overflow and of course the best thing for straining eggs are your fingers [Music] I'll place this on top and what you want to do is form a cup and totally seal the edges make sure you get all the air out [Music] now that our puss is all sealed we're gonna take our four inch ring that we started with to mark them and give them a little cut so we end up with her nice little raviolis there we go and there you have it ready for the water today's a unique day we have friends joining us thanks for joining us guys what a fun day well let's get back to the ravioli what we're doing now is just browning the butter I've got 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter here on the stove and when this gets nice and brown little crispy bits in it which actually gives it a nice nutty flavor we're gonna add some sage leaves I've got two three four sage leaves spirit depends on how much you like and sage can be quite strong so it's up to you how many wanna use I think I'll probably use it for today for a for ravioli and look now the butter is foaming up nicely it's got a foam up once come down and then it starts getting a little brown and it's slowing down the sizzling getting in this second foam here see how that's already turning nice and brown just another minute I'm gonna take it off the heat in the meantime whatever water boiling for a pasta that looks perfect right now I'm gonna take that off the heat and add our sage leaves and that can sit a couple minutes while our pasta boils very important to salt your water when making pasta don't be shy with it you could use up to a spoon in a in a shallow pot there's a season your pasta now we've dropped the raviolis in the water they only take about three minutes just like cooking a poached egg you'll know they're done when they start to float okay these are ready to come out now what I'm gonna do is just drain them on a paper towel to get the excess moisture off and then we'll be ready for plating all right we're gonna go to the plate now and there's our ravioli I'm gonna drizzle some brown butter and you can see how nicely that butter got toasted perfect we're gonna just do a light dusting of Parmesan cheese for decoration a nice little sage leaf to show what it's what's in the butter and we're good to go oh my I gotta show you this just slicing into one of these beautiful raviolis makes my mouth water well there's only one thing left to do and now our favorite time we get to try the goods oh my oh man beautiful flavor fresh
