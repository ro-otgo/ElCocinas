[Music] hey y'all welcome back to my channel so today bunkie and I are in the kitchen and we are going to be cooking up some delicious appetizers that are perfect for game day some great football food I know the Super Bowl coming up a lot of you are probably going to either be hosting your own parties or you're going to be going somewhere where you have to make an appetizer so we thought we would bring you some really good food today so why we make a monkey bowls meat sauce Stephanie bowls with no stuff with mozzarella yeah I'm so excited about those and fun fact I've never even had meatballs so this will be a first for me and then we're making some sausage cheese dip yes that's these favorite buffalo chicken rained and crack-tip I'm so excited I cannot wait to eat all this food so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that we are going to make our our mozzarella stuffed meatballs these take not very long to prepare but they take the longest to cook so you are going to prepare these and then cook them in your crock pot for about two hours but that is perfect because you can easily just transport this to your party or present your house it's like easy cleanup so anyways we're gonna go ahead get startled those and then also punky is going to start grilling our chicken for our buffalo chicken ring so we have that out as well and basically as I go through each recipe I'll kind of show you what all it involves or what the ingredients are for this one I just have some hamburger meat some Italian sausage bread crumbs Parmesan cheese this is some parsley we have some mozzarella and we just got the little pearl so they're already in like little balls so we can just easily stuff them and then of course a jar of red sauce oh and two eggs so anyways those are the ingredients for our meatballs so we're gonna go ahead and get started funky actually found this recipe on tasty and it looks incredible you're both so excited and Bucky loves meatballs but I've never had them so I'm super pumped we're gonna change your life today because y'all know I've just heard any red sauce very recently only in the past like six months so I'm excited I think they're gonna be so yummy I mean how much know does it call for gonna be good let's try okay don't tell the people that it's better milk until after the fact okay okay we need all the minutes are you gonna mix this together babe what's that all the meat and stuff oh wait no yeah okay I'm just getting up some measuring cups so in this bowl we just have a pound of ground beef and then bumpy went ahead and added a pound of Italian sausage as well and he's just gonna go ahead and start combining those [Music] doesn't you don't I'll crack in an egg okay so into this mixture we're gonna put two eggs so punky just practically where's egg number two okay now what she might help doing I need some parmesan and you can give me that wonderful parsley that you just chopped we just get one more little broth cup that looks good okay you that's me telling you that this is is that yeah well it's about half a cup yeah beep site that's close all right how much hard one it says 1/4 cup that's it do that know it so that one of them together I mean they're passing more cards out of this I'm telling you or I'll put Oh gracious here we go there's no way dude this much cheese we're putting cheese with it oh I forgot that still don't you like you [Music] oh right [Music] okay what next a cup of breadcrumbs okay yeah and then barley powder one teaspoon of garlic powder okay one taste business or trying oregano please salt and pepper lunch just like the teeth it says half a teaspoon of each I think last ingredient is half a cup of milk [Music] and then you just gonna mix it all together according to urban legend you don't want to overwork the meat you don't want worker maybe all the breadcrumbs are down at the bottom there's muscles to work okay we're starting simply one book he is well he has formed his first meatball now I'm gonna start handing him the cheese to put inside of it [Music] not too much let's try it we're gonna do like three three little pearls yeah let's take three three pearls it's like together though it's hard to get just three what if I eat half of this while we do it mmm you could just throw a piece in my mouth we catch it I could try one [Music] good lucky I am so impressed I had um Duomo hadn't forced some of the sauce in there yes okay so we're gonna go ahead and get the crock pot warming up so they're cooking on high for two to two and a half hours so I'll go ahead and just get it warm and then Bucky show us how you added your cheese to here [Music] I assume these are gonna cook down a little bit too you know mm-hmm and just gently roll her up do the labor count [Music] okay so I'm gonna go ahead and put just a little bit of our salt into the crock pot so the gist of it is there will be a layer of sauce the only are your meatballs add some more sauce add more meatballs and they'll cook in here for two hours like ratina right yeah just I think you just don't want to make direct contact on the you know [Music] over here snacking while bunkies doing all the hard work give me some cheese okay bunky did just tell me that um these are supposed to have a fourth of a cup like a third of an onion all third of an onion chopped up in here but obviously we did not put that in there because sorry babe that's okay these are humongous I can't really make me smaller though they're gonna go on there's some of me later like on top of that too if there's not just one layer of Meatballs all right last one now we're just gonna cover them with some more sauce [Music] suppose you cover all the meatballs [Music] little puffle it took two hours and then wash your hands all right so all the meatballs are cooking we're gonna go ahead and start on our second recipe which is the salsas cheese dip and this is literally mr. B's favorite thing ever it is so yummy and he feels like he has a secret ingredient some of you probably do this and use it as well but for him it says he can create and he's gonna share it with you guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start browning up the sausage meat by the way I always think grounding gut but is it browning um browning Ronnie yes surprise everyone like a hundred times out here anyways oh yeah it's not hamburger meat it's ground beef whatever be I'm gonna go ahead and start browning the sausage and we have oh we have our teeny-tiny little crock pot which we probably showed you guys before but this thing is like perfect for little parties it's like a great size if you don't want to look around this bad boy so anyway so we're gonna use this yeah it's great there's my favorite thing we're gonna use that to make our cheese dip jeez dude do me except circle your sausage yeah okay hang on you don't show the ingredients oh okay so for this recipe we have some sausage I get the hot one just because you guys know we'd like it spicy around here we have some Velveeta hopefully this is enough I thought we had a little bit more than that but it'll do and then I can't of Rotel if oh here you can share your secret ingredient cream cheese use the whole block or half a bottle blog all right so that's mr. B's secret ingredient you guys want us know in the comments if you use Franklin summers - probably not that's okay all right let's go ahead and start cooking this [Music] am i doing bunkie cutting cheese cutting the cheese I do like to keep it up a little bit though cuz I just feel like it helps him melt faster me on that on it it may or may not actually do anything but I'm sure they're all the same size well you know we're close we're close [Music] - let me show y'all but he just dumped in his one can of Rotel yeah you can use a original or the heart whatever you want we just have some original on hand now this officer is done we'll drain the grease from it and dump it in here as well let it melt and that one's done so simple [Music] it's kind of full there bunk I'm trying to get some cheese edge mixed in with the sausage [Music] okay so once you get this kind of start together you're just going to pop a lid on it and as it continues to melt you can stir it in a little bit more but that is a pot of yumminess right there all right so now that we have our salsas cheese dip going and our meatballs I'm going to go ahead and get started on our buffalo chicken dip we're actually making it into like one of the little rings so we're just going to take some crescent rolls stuff it with the dip and then bake it in the oven and I thought that was like a cool way to be able to kind of eat it without having to let go back and get more it's like you have your own little crescent roll to yourself anyways I don't feel like easy pickup food so first of all we have a chicken that bunky has grilled all we did was like put this in some Frank's Red Hot Sauce so that would give it some flavor so we're gonna go ahead and cut it up into bite-sized pieces and then we have some homemade ranch which is just ranch seasoning milk and mayo and then I have some Franks I also have some green Tabasco so I'll mix those two together and then we're also going to mix in some blue cheese we have some cream cheese and all three of the other cheeses that you could ever want is all set but we just got out to see which ones we wanted to make so anyways I'm gonna go ahead and start making our actual buffalo chicken dip and then um since I get made we'll put it to the top every put it in the oven it'll be done another super simple appetizer let's get going [Music] okay so immobile I have half a block of cream cheese I'm gonna go ahead and add in all the chicken that Bucky just put then I'm going to add in half a cup of ranch dressing as much hot sauce as you want I like it extra spicy while added some green tea I'm gonna add in just a little bit of garlic powder [Music] and then I'm gonna start mixing this together and then once I get it more combined I'll start adding in some cheese [Music] okay so now that I've got it pretty much combined I'm gonna start adding in my cheese's so I'm just adding this one because we have it and thought it sounded really good for this it's a hot hell up in the oven aro that way it'll give it a little bit more spice and then I'm gonna of course anam blue cheese and I think I'm just gonna do a little bit of sharp cheddar I may throw in a few sprinkles mozzarella but I doubt it so anyway I'm gonna start adding in my cheese [Music] I could literally just eat this with a fork oh my gosh I am like salivating right now okay so now that we have our mixture which by the way I was just in here eating out with some tortilla chips and it's incredible we're gonna go ahead and make our ring so I just have my little paintbrush chef stone here monkey is going to assemble our ring because he is way more precise than me and I play make a mess show us what you got all right let's do it [Music] so after bunkie got my little crescent roll triangles down I just want even added a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese and then of course it done to the mixture on top bunkie said that bowl would have helped me stay in the line so that's why he put it down and then I just went in and topped it with a little bit more cheese and then you can see bunkie just flip over all of the crescent rolls to make a perfect little ring it was so simple and easy and I think a crescent roll makes anything taste better the buffalo chicken dip leftover so I just put it in this Pyrex and cover it with some more cheese we're just gonna pop it in the oven I'll let this melt while that cooks and then our meatballs are looking so good I had a few those little mozzarella pearls left so I just shoved them in there so they'll melt I'll be good and then this cheese dip is coming together - mm-hmm okay so our buffalo chicken ring is out of the oven it looks awesome and then this is just that little bit of dip that I put in there and I've already clearly eaten like three bites of it it was delicious and then bunkies a cheese dip looks so good it's bubbling away oh my gosh Oh amazing and then our meatballs only have about 30 minutes left those are looking good so we're actually going over to our neighbors house oh we usually spend some days over there and watch football games with all of our neighbors they're more like our friends and family but um I'm gonna go ahead and pack all this up and take it over with me so tonight we're gonna have a lot of good food and then of course when the meatballs are done well tell you guys how we like them and I'll show you the inside and see if like the cheese melted and all of that but everything just looks so good I don't think I'm gonna make my crack dip I made it one other time and I'll find that video and link it for you guys um in the description box but I realized I didn't have any potato chips and you really want to eat it with potato chips or carrots and also we have any of those either so anyways I'm probably not gonna make that but I will make it again in another video so this is probably all that I'm gonna make but y'all I am like salivating over here I cannot wait for it to all be finished that I can start eating the meatballs are amazing you all they turned out so good and we even had them the next night was just a little bit of spaghetti so we had like spaghetti and meatballs they were perfect and act like even better the next day but they were definitely a hit and we'll be making them again are you all so that's gonna do it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and got lots of great inspiration for your Super Bowl party if you did be sure to give this video a thumbs up and if you're new I would love for you to join my YouTube family so make sure you hit that subscribe button before you leave I love you so very much and I'll see you guys the next one Daniel [Music]
