hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen what peak today simple and delicious recipe is French onion soup if you've watched my videos you know I often encourage you to change things up make it your own take things out that you don't like put things in that you do like I learned this recipe for my dad many years ago and I've tweaked it along the way often I'm asked what type of onions to use and I found out of experimenting over the years I like to mix them up if you're only going to use one use a sweet yellow onion but I like to use two sweet yellow onions one white and one red let's slice these up finger leaders Diamond rings me in a moment for another man things you'll want them to end up about a quarter of an inch thick they're easy to separate and they're kind of stringy like that now I know that looks like an awful lot of onions but they're gonna reduce so I'm gonna be using my heavy stock pot and start off with three tablespoons of olive oil my onions let's get cooking the onions are mixed well with the olive oil they're all separated we'll get that on a medium heat we'll cover it they'll reduce for about 20 minutes you can see that they've reduced quite a bit and now we're going to get to the Browning stage so for this we're gonna add just another over the teaspoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of sugar this will help to brown up the onions and three tablespoons of butter [Music] we're gonna get our heat up a little higher now now this is the important part you must watch you don't want to overdo them you don't want to end up with black onions but you have to be patient it takes a while so we're going to leave the lid off and just stir this every few minutes and keep a close eye on it they will begin to stick on the bottom of the pot and that's okay just use your wooden spoon to keep rubbing them off and any pieces that get stuck on there will be glazed that in a few minutes we're about ten minutes in now you may want to use an oven mitt when you're stirring constantly it gets pretty hot in there so this second step of browning the onions they're all nice and golden brown now for the last minute I'm going to add a couple seasonings half a teaspoon of dried thyme one teaspoon of each salt and pepper and some fresh garlic this garlic is from my garden we grow fresh garlic at my mother and father in law's and use the fresh garlic for this this is three cloves finely diced and we'll cook that in here just for one minute garlic burns very easily now our next step will be to add OBO 3/4 of a cup of white dry wine and see this helps get all the little bits off the bottom and the last item before we add our stock I'm going to add a teaspoon of flour this will just give us a little bit of richness a little thicker texture for our French onion soup now it's time to add the beef stock two boxes in Canada you'll find the 900 mil or in the US it's 32 ounces so 2 boxes of that now this is a low-sodium and those salt out of it it's really quite bland but with all the flavors I put in there it'll be nice and as far as the sodium level goes I've only added 1 TSP of salt but I am gonna add some beef base this a little trick I use for just gives your soups a little extra richness you can tweak it at the end if you like if you're not happy with putting this in I'm just gonna put about a teaspoon in that will enhance my beef flavor it's a beef base you can get it and check in it's a handy little thing to have in the fridge if you just want to tweak your soups and sauces and then we're gonna put two bay leaves in I'm gonna bring this to a boil we'll let it simmer for 30 minutes and then it'll be time to serve it up so here's what you're going to need to make that classic decadent French onion soup I've got a cookie sheet that I cover with tin foil just for easy cleanup an oven-safe hole an English muffin toasted you can cut that up into little squares if you like or you can just drop it right on top after and then some fresh Swiss cheese you can use grier cheese you can mix square and Swiss I however go to the deli get slices of fresh Swiss cheese and I set them off set like so and when I lay that over the top you get that little bit of drizzle over the sides it's perfect and then I top that off with a little fresh grated Parmesan so let's preheat the oven to broil put this together and get it in the oven [Music] [Music] well I hope you enjoyed that recipe don't forget to subscribe to my videos on YouTube you'll get notified every Monday when I put out a new recipe video they're always simple and delicious and I can't wait to get in and try this one I gotta tell you my mouth is watering over this one I did let it cool down a bit oh boy Wow beefy cheesy underneath you're gonna love it well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see station for the next great reason little either way I do well if you don't is over too
