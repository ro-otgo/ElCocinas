[Music] that might be a little much no no never have enough um yes please a mountain of sausage and cheese in a biscuit yeah i'll take it [Music] i think we've gone from like good to great to greatest [Music] hello wesley friends and welcome back to my kitchen i am so excited to be in the kitchen today and make some delicious super easy holiday appetizer recipes with y'all you loved this video last year so i thought it'd be fun to do it again and i have three new recipes that y'all are going to love monkey and i are actually going to have them for dinner tonight so as soon as he gets off work he's gonna come downstairs and we're gonna whip up all of the goodness but i'm gonna go ahead and get this first recipe started because it does take a little bit longer to bake in the oven and this first recipe is going to be some little individual baked potato bites that has my name written all over it if you invite me to a party and you have these i'm your girl okay so to get started on these i have three russet potatoes here depending on how many you're making is how many you will use since it's just monkey and i have a dinner tonight i'm just gonna do these three and i've already washed and dried them and then i'm just going to take my knife and cut them kind of into like one i guess it's one inch or half inch little discs so basically this thickness just like this [Music] okay i'm actually not even gonna use this one because i feel like for monkey and i this is plenty so i'm just gonna put these on a baking dish um just kind of like on their side here and then i'm gonna brush them with a little bit of oil [Music] okay so now that i have oiled them on both sides at this point you can season them with salt and pepper but i'm not gonna season them with salt and pepper because i'm gonna take it up a notch so let me show you what i'm gonna use to season these i'm gonna use some of my auntie no-no's everything seasoning and y'all i am so so excited because guess what auntie no-no's is sponsoring today's video and i am the most excited for this y'all know mandy is one of my very best friends and i have heard her rave about these seasonings for such a long time so of course i had to try them and they are so good like did not disappoint they are amazing we literally use them on everything so i'm gonna flip you around we're gonna season these and i'm gonna tell you guys a little bit more about auntie no nose auntie no nose has three delicious seasonings all of which are gluten-free vegan-friendly non-gmo kosher and no msg this everything seasoning literally we put it on everything it is so good it's a one and done custom blend of savory spices that brings out the zest in whatever you put it on they also have the seafood seasoning and the firecracker sea salt which is one of my favorites and right now you can actually get all three in their savory sampler gift box this would be an awesome gift for that person in your life who loves to cook or grill so y'all know that we love a little bit of heat in our food and this firecracker sea salt seasoning is so good we've actually put this on popcorn it was delicious we put this on chicken wings i've added this to my pasta i mean like chicken alfredo and a little bit of this to kind of give it a little kick so so good we love this one and then this auntie no nose seafood seasoning bee actually used on some salmon the other night and he was raving about it he said it was so good like some of the best seasoning he's ever had for seafood so he actually got some shrimp and we're gonna make that tonight to go along with our appetizers and of course we'll use our auntie no-no's seafood seasoning on that as well this seafood seasoning has notes of lemon paprika and mustard which bring a sweet and savory kick to fish or any dish and i'm telling y'all bee can not get enough of this one he loves it and this is also a great seasoning if you're wanting to blacken something if you want to try any of these antino seasonings and you should you should get all three because they're so good i say try that savory sampler gift box it's the best way to go there will be a link down below in my description box for you guys and you can also use my discount code which is jessica10 i'll put it right here on the screen but be sure you head down there click that link and go check out all of these seasonings you will love them okay these are going into the oven at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes okay i don't know about y'all but you cannot have a baked potato without some bacon so while those are in the oven i'm gonna go ahead and fry up a couple pieces of bacon which we'll crumble and put on top and of course we're gonna top it with lots of sharp cheddar cheese and then i actually have another recipe that also calls for cheddar cheese so i'm just gonna go ahead and shred up a ton of it so we'll have it for our next recipe too so that's what i'm gonna do while those are cooking [Music] we got chef funky in here now okay so bacon is done and then with this bacon grease i'm gonna take my little yes yes okay my spatula thing and i'm just gonna kind of drizzle a little bit of this bacon grease on top of our potatoes and then we'll pop them back in the oven for just like five more minutes i know did you already flip those once no should we we'll go ahead i'll go ahead and just grease up both sides slightly yeah yeah we need to give them a turn honey yeah i agree they already look so good okay let's turn them did you get them all yeah we can do this other side too oh look at that that's what i'm talking about are they hot yeah a little let me let me help you out sug these are gonna be so good i know uh potatoes isn't your favorite thing uh-huh but it's my favorite thing well these are looking like they're gonna be uh pretty nice pretty nice [Music] these are full flavored potatoes okay back in the oven five minutes and then we'll bring them out and top them with our bacon and cheese and then cook them for five more minutes cheese cheese cheese louise i haven't seen that one that's why i just um grated all that cheese wow that's that's a lot of cheeseburger well it's for another recipe too okay we need to chop this up into bite-sized pieces [Music] okay so it has been the five minutes y'all these just look it smells so good we have our bacon over here we're gonna top them with some green onions or top monkeys with that once they're completely done and then i also have my cheese and we will dump them dump them dunk them in some sour cream as well like oh my gosh these are gonna be so good so to each of these we're just gonna take like a little bit of bacon for each one and then a little bit of cheese as well [Music] okay back into the oven for just five more minutes and then these will be done we'll top them with the green onion the sour cream oh my goodness i cannot wait can i just put a little pile of cheese on the side here oh gosh yes let's just do that you know that's gonna be good slide you over a little bit maybe hold on you know i thought to myself that they should be called what cheesy scallion potato medallions dude that is so good thank you funky that is genius i i thought they deserved a good name you know that is a great name there we go oh my god oh wow oh yeah oh my goodness y'all know how much we love some cheese i love some potato i love some bacon like are you kidding me and then and then you just pow oh you're like no you didn't just do that these are about to be delish that's hot are you gonna scrape that up and just like eat it i'm probably gonna let it uh you know it's gonna like harden just slightly yeah and then i'll pop it up it's going to be like a like a chip or cheese chip [Music] now because we have this kind of sour cream where i can just squeeze it i'm gonna put like a tiny little dollop on there just to kind of make them look really cute but you could also just put some sour cream in a little dish on the side for people to like dip it in [Music] they're still a little bit hot they're not that hot oh yeah coming from smite who doesn't even really like potatoes this is good y'all this is a must try recipe like um you know when you go to a restaurant you order potato skins this is like that but so much better because it's less potatoey because it's like thinner you know and just like all the goodness oh my gosh their own these are like ridiculously good i could literally eat 20 of these for myself you don't know what you're missing out life without the green onion legit probably my favorite appetizer i've ever made very easy to do they take a little bit of time to like bake in the oven but they're so simple they have so much flavor that anti-no no seasoning on there i'm telling y'all it's perfection like that seasoning is good on everything i even thought about putting a little bit of the firecracker on here just to give it like a kick but these are so delicious they're great yes [Music] okay so now i'm gonna get started on this second recipe and i honestly don't even know how it could top the first recipe because that was so good and by the way you could also dip those in ranch dressing and that would be even as delicious as the sour cream but anyway i went ahead and brown up some sausage and y'all know like my famous recipe um the appetizer i always make that's like the crescent rolls sausage and cream cheese mixture and then the crescent rolls on top you know how everyone is like obsessed with that recipe well this is very similar but kind of a new spin on it and you know how i make my bacon and cheese bites this is kind of like a mix between my bacon and cheese bites and my sausage and cream cheese casserole so let me just tell you i know it's gonna be out of this world so good so i have my sausage browned up here to this i'm gonna add in some cream cheese a dash of worcestershire and then some shredded cheddar cheese and i of course i'm kind of like halfing this again just because it's me and bunky but i will leave the full recipe down in my description box for you guys but you would use like a full thing of sausage i only did about half of it so i'm gonna go ahead and mix this all together and then i'll show you what we're gonna do next [Music] and you do want to let your cream cheese like sit out and come to room temperature so it's a lot easier to stir in i did not let mine sit out long enough okay i got some funky power in there and he helped me stir it up the rest of the way so as long as it is like good and combined this is good to go so next you're going to get a muffin tin pan is how you call this yeah why does that sound weird muffin tin pan muffin pan whatever muffin pan and then you're gonna get some biscuits and i always use a layer of biscuits um i think it would be really good in this recipe just to kind of pull in half that way it's not too biscuity too doughy you know what i mean so i'm just going to pull each one in half place it in the bottom of my muffin pan and then put a little bit of this mixture on top is this not going to be so stinking delicious so you're putting half a biscuit in each one of these little holes you just like literally lay it in there because my bacon and cheese bites you know how like they're smaller little mini muffins yeah this is like the big size regular muffin it's gonna be so good y'all [Music] for instance here's my biscuit i am just going to literally oh do half yeah and then just sit that down in there all right you see you're making this look way too easy it's so easy [Music] okay and then to that you're just going to add your mixture right on top now that might be a little much no no never have enough oh no you think that's good well this one you were a little bit aggressive this one much better oh yep i just want a little bit more you know what this is oh my gosh when you're like over filling these things it's gonna be no it's been perfect you know what this kind of reminds me of i don't know what those um my sausage muffins that i make you know that maybe yeah i already thought about that yeah kind of like it's an easier way to do it yeah it's uh so simple it's just minus eggs and bisquick whoops i'm making a mess yeah you were doing so good now we're gonna have burnt crunchy spots right there do you do you need to like smush them out a little bit to bring them all the way up around the edges or you don't have to why from what i can tell from the recipe that i saw you just like literally lay it in there um why don't you just throw that in in one of those tins and just good idea just do it okay yeah leave the whole thing in there okay um okay so these are going to go into the oven at 375 just whatever the can of your biscuits say i'm pretty sure they all say 3.75 and it'll probably be in there for like 13 to 15 minutes but we'll keep an eye on it and i'll tell you guys the exact time once they're done now while those are in there i'm going to claim the kitchen we are not going to make our third recipe tonight we're going to make it in the morning and we are actually leaving to go camping tomorrow we're so excited you're like on vacation yep my vacation starts now it starts because you've been helping me in the kitchen um well after we eat those but anyway um well that's my dessert that's your dessert that's my prize yes that's my reward that's my breakfast tomorrow morning that's breakfast that's what's gonna say so we're going camping tomorrow morning or we're gonna leave tomorrow during lunchtime so i'm gonna take those with us and we can have that for breakfast tomorrow and then our third appetizer that we're gonna make in the morning we can take those and just have like all weekend to snack on they're gonna be scrumptious so anyway after we make those they're poppable people they're poppable what's that mean pop it in your mouth and eat it oh yes it's just yes um anyway we'll make the other one tomorrow morning cause it's getting late and we can't eat you know three full recipes no shrimp i can only eat but so much yeah i need to stop snacking on this cheese okay it's been 13 minutes and i think they're pretty much done i mean what have you created here i mean this looks so good um yes please a mountain of sausage and cheese in a biscuit yeah yeah i'll take it here's the first one that you made maybe i did i think i did stuff that one a little too much you know i was thinking too what like for you i could literally put like uh dice up like a green bell pepper super finely and put that in there or even like onions you would love that yeah this would be good with probably uh some green and red bell pepper in it oh for christmas it'd be so offensive you see what i did there my poor bunkie he sounds like he's getting sick again i don't know about my throat i hope you're not let's get these out so they can um cool cool and then like stop cooking the time has come it is finally time to taste test this deliciousness you want to split one with me yeah yeah you're breaking that in half i mean this just looks so good you can't hand this to me fast enough i think it's kind of hot still [Music] are you all smiles up there yes oh wow [Music] you know what i think is really important here what the worcestershire mm-hmm that i i'm i'm tasting a little bit of the worcestershire in there it gives it like a nice depth of flavor in there yeah um like a richness then you have like that flaky fluffy biscuit oh my gosh i'm actually pleasantly surprised with how well the biscuit still cooked and it was exactly 13 minutes by the way these are delicious these are really good yeah these would even be great for like a breakfast for your kiddos or like breakfast appetizer or whatever it's a great recipe so like i told you guys i'm gonna go ahead and get cleaned up and then we'll meet you back here in the morning to make our third and final recipe that's going to be as equally as delicious as these two have already been and then the one camp and then we're going camping we're so excited i made another one another one too well i guess we're really only having one each because we split the first one yeah oh my gosh oh there we go do y'all see that it's just cheesy ooey gooey goodness okay good morning we got our coffee i have everything laid out here to make this recipe we're going to call these like a little brie balm i think they are going to be delicious so first things first is you're going to need a can of crescent rolls if you want to get the one that's like a dough sheet that already that doesn't have any seams by all means i just already had these in the fridge so i'm going to use them but first thing you want to do is roll this out and then pinch all of your little seams together um the actual recipe says to cut this into 24 even pieces but since again it's just me and monkey i'm not going to be too precise unless you want to do the math oh i'm going to be precise oh okay i'm gonna let monkey cut our crescent roll dough since you know he's way more precise than me but basically we are just going to cut little teeny even bite size squares let's see so we got so we're going to go thirds that's way too small wait a minute i shouldn't have done that hold on we need there's four six oh yeah we should have gone this way we'll we'll we'll do this half properly how about that okay this is if we don't have it you know the exact amount okay so now that we have our crescent rolls cut into little bite size pieces you're just going to take a mini muffin tin pan and i am going to go ahead and lightly spray it so that they don't stick and then we'll kind of press down our little um crescent roll and then we're going to cut our brie into bite-sized pieces as well and we'll put a little piece of this brie inside each one and then i'll show you guys the rest of the ingredients [Music] okay so now that we have our brie in there we're just going to take a little bit of apricot preserves and put on top of it you could also do like fig or raspberry kind of like whatever jam you want i just love apricot especially with brie and then we're gonna also put some chopped pecans on there so you're just gonna take a little spoonful and put like a little dollop on top of each one [Music] okay so next we are just going to top those with a little bit of these chopped pecans and then a little bit of flaky sea salt the salt is going to take it over the top [Music] okay and that is it these are going into the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes okay these are out of the oven y'all they look so good i just have them on my cute little christmas spode um christmas tree little platter and then i left two over here on my cooling rack for monkey and i to taste test i am so excited to try these i do want to tell you when they come out of the oven they kind of look messy but once i got them out of the um pan they were perfectly fine cheers oh my goodness whoa this is so good what are you laughing about i'm trying to find my words to describe this because it's like ridiculous the first little thing i tasted was the pecans and then a little bit of the sweetness from that apricot but then the brie comes in at the back the brie is so warm and melty and like oh my gosh it really is i think we've gone from like good to great to greatest it's so good like these things are worth totally worth making like you cannot just eat one you would eat like a hundred because they're so good i try to tell you we need to make all 24. i'll try to tell you and i love that it's just a tiny little bite oh my gosh y'all the ones are crucial we could do walnuts too maybe the pink eyes give it daisy may want some they give it just like a um acid pink i think a little nuttiness and crunch and you could um start talking with my mouth full hang on and for like presentation you could put some like rosemary little sprigs on there to make it look even more festive and fun but y'all have to make these they are scrumptious and they were super simple to make anyway we're gonna go keep stuff in our faces these things are so good breakfast of champions here yeah we're not gonna have any to take with us but anyway i love you guys thank you for hanging out with us in the kitchen i hope you enjoy love and try
