hi lovelies our cozy fall soup series continues today with one of my very favorite hearty and satisfying recipes it's pasta fagioli soup now if you have never had the pleasure of trying this soup for yourself you are in for such a treat it's nutrient-rich full of fiber and filling thanks to the addition of both pasta and beans in fact pasta fagioli is basically a direct translation for pasta and beans which is the base of this soup and it's actually really really simple to prepare so to get started i have got a little bit of olive oil heating up over medium-high heat in a nice big soup pot on the stove now if you don't have one of these already i highly recommend investing in one it's one of the kitchen tools that i use the most year after year and you don't have to splurge for a super expensive one you can get one for under fifty dollars like this one was and i'm gonna get started by browning my ground beef once that beef is in the pot i'm going to go ahead and break it up into little bits using the side of my spoon and i want to season it liberally with a little salt and a little pepper i've opted for some extra lean ground beef here and that's always a good idea in a soup like this because you don't want a lot of extra fat floating around in your soup this is a really good place to use as lean a beef as you can find now if you don't want to use meat in this recipe you definitely have the option to leave it out i've also seen this made with italian sausage you could use hot or mild both would be really really tasty you could also lighten this up a little bit by using some ground poultry instead so some turkey or some chicken if you wanted to or you also have the option to just leave the meat out entirely and keep this vegetarian totally up to you just as soon as that beef is nice and brown we're gonna go ahead and start building in our flavor here and to do that i'm starting with a traditional mirepoix that's what they call this classic mixture of onion celery and carrots tons of great flavor plus tons of great nutrients as well and we just want to let these cook up for another say three to four minutes or until they're nice and soft then it's time to add even more great flavor to this and i'm going to be doing that courtesy of some garlic now i think i mentioned this in my last video but it's worth mentioning again we have been plagued by cold season in our house my daughter ella is in daycare and so we basically pick up everything that's going around the daycare and needless to say everyone has been sick pretty much consistently for a month so soup has been our savior i always like to add tons of garlic to my soup because garlic has lots of immunity boosting power and that is something we could really use around our house right now i also want to get in here with even more great flavor and to do that i'm going to be adding an italian seasoning that's loaded with dried herbs like thyme oregano parsley and basil you can use homemade or store-bought both work really well in this recipe and i'll just let that seasoning heat up for another minute or so to help it really maximize its flavor mmm you won't believe how good this already smells super soothing to the soul then it's time to go ahead and add my beans to the pot in this case i'm using a combination of cannellini beans also known as white kidney beans as well as some red kidney beans but to be perfectly honest you can use whatever canned beans you have lying around in your pantry i always have canned beans on hand because of course they're loaded with fiber great for you and require almost no cooking at all what's not to love about that once my beans are in the pot i'm gonna go ahead and add my tomatoes as well so i've got some crushed tomatoes headed in here as well as some diced tomatoes because i like the two different textures happening i'm also going to be adding some beef broth to my pot now you can really use any kind of broth you want in this recipe i'm opting for beef because of course it works really well with the ground beef that we're using here but if you were using italian sausage or some ground poultry you could use chicken broth or some veggie broth if you wanted to leave this vegetarian definitely up to you next i'm gonna go ahead and add my secret ingredient which i really believe takes this soup right over the top in terms of flavor and my secret ingredient is actually a parmesan rind now if you don't know what this is it's basically the piece that's left over once you've grated your full piece of parmesan and usually people throw them away but what i like to do is actually save them in a zipper bag and store them in either my fridge or my freezer and then whenever i'm making a nice savory soup like this i just pop the whole rind right into the soup and it imparts the most beautiful umami flavor into the soup you won't even believe how delicious it becomes now at this point i'm just going to let this come to a nice rolling boil and once it's reached that boil i want to go ahead and add my pasta to this and here i'm using traditional detali pasta that's super classic in this soup super classic in this soup super classic but you can really use any kind of small pasta you wanted to you could use some macaroni some mini shells or even some orzo if that's what you have on hand and basically what we're going to do is let those shells cook away in that delicious broth until they're nice and tender that usually takes between say 10 and 12 minutes now some people would tell you to cook your shells in a separate pot and then add them to your soup but i just add an extra cup or two of broth to compensate for the fact that my shells are going to absorb a lot of that liquid and that way i don't have to dirty any more dishes because guys let's be honest i have two kids i've already got plenty of dishes to do so while that pasta is boiling and bubbling away i'm going to go ahead and add my second secret ingredient and that is just a little bit of sugar so i've got about two teaspoons here and i'm going to sprinkle it into my pot i know this seems totally counter-intuitive in a savory recipe like this but that sugar is just going to help cut the acidity of those tomatoes just a little bit you're not even going to be able to detect it it's not going to make your soup sweet or anything but it's going to mellow out that acidity quite a bit so i highly recommend adding it to your pot and just as soon as that pasta is fully cooked this soup is ready to be enjoyed i like going in and removing my parmesan rind because of course it's done all its hard work and honestly it is ready for serving i like finishing it off with some freshly chopped parsley just for a bit of green and freshness as well as some freshly grated parmesan cheese because honestly guys what is not made better with freshly grated parmesan am i right some people call this a soup i think it eats a lot more like a stew regardless it is one of the most delicious things you will eat this fall i promise you that in fact i'm ready to have a bowl right now this soup is so hearty flavorful and satisfying it totally eats like a meal it's the perfect thing on a chili fall day the flavor is so good your entire family is sure to love it and i hope you will give it a try for
