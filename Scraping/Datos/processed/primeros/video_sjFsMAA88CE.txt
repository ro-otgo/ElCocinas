there on a really beautiful day which today was perfect and i go get a coffee from my favorite new little coffee shop it's called brown fox coffee box it's literally out of a small little horse trailer it's so cute and it's the best coffee and it is just like the perfect way to start my day so i'm gonna do that i hope you enjoy the beautiful scenery of the marshwalk i love it in the morning when the sun is like sparkling on the water and then i'm also going to make some oatmeal for bunkie and i and then go get in the shower so i can get ready for the day [Music] do okay so i am out of the shower obviously i still need to do my makeup but i want to tell you what we're going to do today um i have to kind of whisper because tomorrow is funky's birthday and i still need to get him a birthday present so we gotta go out and do some shopping so i can hopefully get him what he wants he's been talking about this um sorry i'm really trying to whisper she doesn't hear me he's talking about this like um blower and weed eater for the yard that he wants from clothes so that's gonna be our first stop to see if we can try and find that um and i need to get in like a card i plan on making him some avocado toast in the morning so anyway you gotta do that and then i also want to make a new recipe for lunch i think it's gonna be so good i am like looking so forward to it um but first before i do my makeup i am literally so excited and a huge thank you to don beauty for sponsoring today's video i have been using dime for the past year and i have told monkey so many times wouldn't it be so cool if i got to work with dime and now it like it's actually happening and i just am so thankful and so excited because i have bought used loved their products for the past year and it has like truly helped my skin so much so i'm so excited to like show y'all my little morning routine is before i do my makeup so if i didn't take a shower in the morning i would go ahead and use the gentle jelly cleanser i love this i use it every single night it never makes my skin feel like it's stripped of its nutrients if anything it feels like it balances out my skin it feels super supple afterwards and still hydrated and it almost just like melts off my makeup which is awesome so i use this day and night and then my tried and true product and the whole reason that i fell in love with dime was because of their toner this is truly the best toner i've ever used and for that same reason because my skin feels perfectly balanced afterwards it doesn't feel stripped it doesn't feel like it's burning or tingling it feels good and hydrated and supple and so i have loved this honor so much now for my serum i use the hyaluronic acid serum and y'all if you want hydrated supple plump glowy skin this is your serum your serums like your powerhouse that's what's going to penetrate deep in there and if you don't use a hyaluronic acid or don't know about them they actually help to like retain moisture in your skin so it is like the greatest thing if you are dry or normal and you want that like hydrated glowy look this serum will be your best friend you just put it on after toner and before moisturizer they also have the hyper glow serum which is just going to be like your brightening serum so if you have dark spots or pigmentation this one is great and then for moisturizer they have the dewy day cream and then also the restorative night cream so depending on if it's day or night and both of those are incredible not too heavy perfectly hydrating and just to tell you a little bit more about down beauty they offer luxury skincare beauty and wellness products at affordable prices which is another reason i love them so much because the skincare is so good and it's affordable and they only use clean ingredients they are vegan cruelty free and they have no harsh chemicals like y'all does it get better than this time also uses eco-friendly glass packaging

present there was like five different ones to choose from so i'm hoping that i got the right one i asked the guys in there if they could help me and they said if it was for their birthday this is the one they would want and i'm pretty sure this is the same one that i saw monkey looking at um so it's his new blower and we needer and hopefully he loves it i'm actually really excited to give it to him tomorrow i need to ask him like what he wants to do for his birthday because he hasn't told me so hopefully we'll go to dinner or something to celebrate but anyway i'm gonna head home so we can make our yummy lunch i'm so excited for this and i'm honestly starving so i'm ready to cook okay really fast well monkey is not down here his mom came over last night so we could celebrate his birthday with her she's at the beach this weekend and she got monkeys and chocolates in her shirt look forever and ever she has always drawn this little monkey on like anything she gives to be and so now this little monkey is like what we call a bunkie how cute is that and no way i had to whisper because he can hear me but she hid the dinosaur and i thought he hadn't found it he found the dinosaur so now i've got to find it he hid it from me what's the plan stan for what for your birthday what do you want to do tomorrow i don't have any thoughts yet funky you don't i'm just going to spend it with you but are you wanting to like cook dinner here do you want to go out to dinner do you want a certain type of dinner do you want balloons in a cake pop like well i don't think i need uh i don't need a cake pop because we got the good cake right oh yeah monkey's mom when she came over last night she brought our favorite aldi cake y'all it's ridiculously good and i do think that i i want to go eat somewhere you wanna go to dinner yeah are you thinking like italian cheeseburger mexican food these are your favorites we haven't had mexican food in like a month we gotta find a new spot down here we haven't we haven't found our new place yeah can you keep thinking on it i'm a noodle on it okay so now for this lunch recipe i saw this guy make these chicken wings on instagram and they looked so good and my bunk loves some like air fryer chicken wings and i never eat any um lemon pepper ones you'd ever order those either i feel like but heated lemon pepper and hot sauce and he did um like baking soda it's baking soda bacon powder and he did some baking soda on there to like help everything i feel like adhere and stick better and get more crispy yeah it helps with the crunch the conscious vacation the crunchification yes so i'm so excited to make these are going to be really simple and the only thing i'm going to tweak because y'all know how to tweak something is i'm just going to add in a little bit of garlic powder because i feel like i just need some garlic flavor in my chicken wings agreed so these are going to be really good garlic flavor on everything exactly y'all know we are some what do you call like a vampire who loves garlic vampires do not like vampires stay away from us okay so here's our setup we got the wings um you're just gonna need a little bit of oil i'm just gonna use our avocado oil like i said the garlic powder baking soda hot sauce and then i picked us up some lemon pepper seasoning we're switching something up real fast so i went back and watched the recipe one more time and they say baking powder not baking soda and bunk says he feels like corn starch would be even better so we're going to do corn starch it's only like a tablespoon so honestly it's probably not going to make that big of a difference right right i'm looking to see what else we got up in the cabinet i don't think we have we might have baking powder but no we do but i just feel like cornstarch is really the more traditional appropriate option yeah okay all right so here our chicken wings in here and do all the things just like i said before okay so drizzle of oil and then our lemon pepper which they use a lot we're going to do a just sprinkle of this cornstarch and then i'm going to add in my garlic right now as well [Music] you want to be our tosser yeah oh yeah what can i get in here with this fork too yeah i mean spit this is a spoon all right let's see here i think we might need to uh add a little bit more lemon pepper yeah we'll see where this gets this first are you trying to have some like delicious chicken wings for lunch i'm so hungry i know me too i i ate an apple earlier oh i'm proud of you thank you i did have my little bit of oatmeal i forgot about you have some oatmeal i've had an apple and um you know we're both getting our fiber and you know what i decided actually today i want to make use of like pretty oatmeal with like blueberries and raspberries and honey and cinnamon like that is a bunky breakfast yeah i mean you know the pretty oatmeal is what really it was a pretty oatmeal i'm gonna sprinkle a little more coverage there that's good oh these already look so good you got a nice color going about them was it enough oil oh yeah yeah they're uh i'm still gonna sprinkle a little more lemon pepper on there how much did it say i mean he didn't do a lot let's do a little more garlic too okay now these are going to go into the airfryer at 380 degrees how long did it say 20 minutes um i think he said between 15 and 20 minutes so i guess but i mean my personal preference is longer because i like all of the fat to render out you know take us in like extra i like crunchy crispy wings okay so we're gonna go 380 probably for more like 20 minutes plus [Music] okay so they've been here for a little over oh actually a lot over 10 minutes probably 15 minutes oh bonkey oh wow these look so good yeah they do oh my goodness i was just going to say i would give them a little shake yeah they look like they need a little shake wow these look really good i feel like yeah we need to get all these undersides facing put that one over right there which one this one no that one this one no this one yeah i think that that like cornstarch makes a difference it definitely does okay we're popping these back in for the remainder five to eight minutes we'll see okay so the chicken wings are done in the airfryer we're gonna put them in another bowl and then toss them into melted butter which if you've seen the past couple videos we still don't have a microwave we have like seriously gotta go get one this weekend we need to put that on the list oh thanks i underestimated the uh how often we use one yeah i didn't realize that um microwave is a frequently used tool yeah we were like oh we can get away like not having one but no we actually need a microwave so anyway i'm just gonna put a little bit of butter in my bowl and then toss our chicken wings in there and just let it melt as we like toss them around and then we're going to add our hot sauce and more of our lemon pepper lemon pepper like my mouth jets are going okay butter oh they look perfect these look yummy so good okay tossing these in i might need some tongs now we're gonna add in our hot sauce you all know we like it spicy so however much you want is that a good start point yeah it's your mouth jets going crazy yeah did you you could hear that yeah okay and then just a little bit more of this lemon pepper [Music] i can smell that yeah my nose is uh my nose is definitely perked up look a little bit more oh yeah he he said two tablespoons that's a lot [Music] these look amazing well i'm excited to bite into one i'll let you go first okay all right nice nice fingertip coat already oh yes [Music] give us the low down is the lemon pepper hot sauce the bomb diggity or is it weird it's not weird i think the um daisy may smell so you still get the good you know classic heat right yes daisy may want some chicken wings hearts can't have no chicken no this will burn your mouth girl but i think the um the lemon uh-huh i i'm having a hard time describing it but it actually like you can it gives it a brightness or something yeah it's almost like it really gives it maybe a little this sounds obvious but like a citrus element yeah and then the pepper of course i mean just so they're really good pepper packed yeah i mean it's it's a nice spin on the classic um just buffalo oh okay i'm excited to try them and one more thing airfryer wings are so easy and they're so good so much more simple than like any other way you can make wings yeah that second that bite i just took was like real real good and pepper goodness yeah okay my thought on these wings is like the lemon pepper i know exactly what you're saying it's like this lemony surprise that you don't expect but is so well complimented with like the buffalo sauce i can't describe it but it's like this brightness and like citrusy that was it's amazing i was imagining like something so powerful like me too lemon lemon juice no i was envisioning like the lemon pepper was gonna be overpowering with the hot sauce yeah but no they're like perfectly paired yeah they're they're nice compliments to each other very good so you all have to make those tell me what you think i'm gonna go ahead wrap up this video here i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with me today be sure you wish mr b a very happy birthday down below in the comments
