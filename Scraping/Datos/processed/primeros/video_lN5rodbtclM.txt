hello lovelies we have got a stupendous episode for you today because I am making still three delicious ways and I could not be more excited about it obviously the chilly fall weather has set in which is my house means it's jus season we're gonna kick things off today with a classic beef stew as always I'm starting with a nice big Dutch oven on the stove if you don't have a Dutch oven a soup pot will do as well here and I'm just going to get a little oil heating up in the bottom of my pot over medium-high heat once my oil is nice and hot I am going to add my stewing beef to the pan because things are going to cook for a long time and have an ample chance to break down and soften up and get tender you can go ahead and use way more affordable cuts of meat like stewing beef for example which is really affordable because it's not very tender naturally on its own but since it's going to stew for at least an hour or two it's going to soften up and become delicious all we're going to do is season it up with a little salt and a little pepper you just want to keep it moving to make sure it gets browned evenly once your beef has just browned you can go ahead and start building in your flavor now of course I love doing this with a classic combination of onion celery and carrot there's almost no super stew that I don't use these ingredients in I absolutely love them together we'll give that a stir and then we'll let this all heat up together for between 4 and 5 minutes just until the veggies start to soften up you'll notice the celery turns bright green that means we are ready for even more wonderful flavor I am using a combination of minced garlic a little bit of tomato paste and some Worcestershire sauce let me tell you these three ingredients pack a serious flavor punch will let those cook up for another minute stirring them constantly and then as soon as they become really nice and fragrant we'll go ahead and add a red wine to the pot now this is definitely optional you do not have to make this recipe with anyone at all but I do love the depth of flavor that this red wine as you don't have to worry about the alcohol content in this the alcohol evaporates and all you're left with is that cheap rich flavor guys I know I say this a lot but I really wish you could smell this one at this point we are gonna go ahead and add even more awesomeness in the form of potatoes then I'm going to add my plastic beef bra and finally I'm going to add some fresh thyme to the pot now you'll notice I didn't even pull the thyme leaves off its stem we'll get it out of there later once all of this yumminess comes to a boil you can reduce your heat to medium-low pop the lid on that pot and then let this simmer away now thirty minutes is fine here but of course when it comes to stew the longer its dues the better it's going to be so if you have an hour definitely take an hour if you have an hour and a half even better keep that puppy covered and let it simmer away until those potatoes are super tender and of course that beef is just falling apart the final step is just to thicken this up now if you leave it as is it's just soup but the thickening process is really what makes it - I'm going to be doing this today with some cornstarch you can also do this with some all-purpose flour it's totally up to you which you prefer they both work in exactly the same way to make this slurry all I'm going to do is essentially add some water chew my cornstarch and then give it a whisk like so you want to get it all combined so that you don't get any chunks of cornstarch or flour in it your stew I'm just going to pour it right into my pot and keep stirring this until it starts to thicken up season it up of course with a little salt and a little pepper and it is ready to be enjoyed I like serving this deliciousness with a nice piece of crusty bread slathered in butter and there you have it my friends dinner is served trust me it is totally worth the effort it's stupid how delicious this dish is next step I'm going to show you guys my hearty chicken stew now I will just tell you that both my husband and our baby to be are obsessed with this right now so I'm making it at least once a week and the good news is it's actually really really easy like the first two we made I'm just going to heat some oil up and once my oil is nice and hot I can get onions celery and carrots into the pot we'll let those cook away for a few minutes until they start to soften up and then I'm going to go ahead and add my chicken now this is a really wonderful recipe to use up any leftover chicken you have in the fridge with my chicken I am also going to add some diced potatoes into the pot again this is all about hearty dishes that really satisfied during the phone lines so they have to have potatoes in them once my potatoes are in the pot I'm going to go ahead and cover all of this with my chicken broth it's always a good idea to use really good-quality chicken broth in your cooking and if you have the time to make homemade broth I highly recommend you do I have a great recipe on the channel I will link it in the description box so you can take a look at it for yourself to add even more deliciousness to the pot I am going to be adding some fresh herbs so I've got some chopped sage headed into my pot as well as another full sprig of thyme I'm just going to let the mixture come to a boil once it's reached a boil I'll reduce my heat to medium-low pop a lid on and let it simmer away it for as long as I possibly can trust me my friends it was worth the wait coz things look and smell amazing I am basically going to go in and just remove my time stem it's always really important otherwise some lucky eater is going to have this in their dish probably not super delicious and then we can go ahead and thicken this up once again I'm doing this with a cornstarch and water mixture and flour will work just as well once my stew is thickened I am going to add three more delicious ingredients to take this right over the top first up I've got some frozen corn kernels as well as some frozen peas headed into my pot the best part about these is they only take 2 or 3 minutes to heat through and I'm also going to finish this off with a little bit of parsley which really helps to freshen and brighten up all the flavors I'll hit this as I always do with a little salt and a little pepper and seriously two to three minutes later you have what I consider to be a total kitchen masterpiece finally for all my vegan friends out there who are just hankering for a rich hearty dish to come home to on a cold autumn evening I am making a really really hearty loaded with veggies mushroom stew it starts once again with some oil heating up in my Dutch oven to that I am going to add some mushrooms of course in this case I'm using a combination of cremini mushrooms and portobello mushrooms that have been chopped up you can really use any kind of mushrooms you want in this recipe we're gonna let those mushrooms cook down until they've released all of their moisture and then we'll go ahead and add our onion celery and carrot to the pot we'll give that a quick chance to soften up over four or five minutes then we'll go ahead and add some garlic to the pot now this dish can handle a lot of garlic so two three four cloves I do not judge and let's be honest if everyone in the house is eating it it's almost like you didn't eat garlic at all thirty seconds later that garlic will be nice and aromatic and fragrant which means you know it's time to pile your potatoes into the pot as well as some barley barley is such an awesome fiber rich addition to a stew like this it's also going to help naturally thicken up your stew and then once our barley is in there we are going to add our liquids in this case I am adding some bass tomatoes and then some mushroom broth vegetable broth is fine but if you want a much richer umami flavor you definitely want to go mushroom broth in this recipe to add even more great flavor to this dish I am going to be using some beautiful herbs so I've got some fresh thyme headed in a bay leaf as well as some freshly chopped rosemary all of these pack a ton of flavor I'm going to bring this mixture to a boil pop the lid on reduce the heat to medium-low and let this simmer away it's really important that you give that barley a chance to cook through fully and usually that takes between 30 and 45 minutes so you don't want to rush this line and then once your barley is cooked first things first we want to remove our bay leaf and our time then you can go ahead and add your cornstarch slurry to this now this is delicious just as it is but because I am all about getting more greens in when I can I am also going to add some trimmed and cut green beans to this pot the good part about green means is that they take almost no time to cook so within three to four minutes they'll be nice and tender and ready to serve season this up with a little salt and a little pepper and oh my gosh guys vegan comfort food this do is I must say very savory Wow it's too much of a stretch wouldn't you agree I
