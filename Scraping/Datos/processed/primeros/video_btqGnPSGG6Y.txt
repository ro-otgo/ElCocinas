[Music] you [Music] yet did an outstanding job on that turkey and you've got leftovers let's make a turkey stew let's start off with a little prep work first we're gonna need two cups of diced onions two diced celery two diced carrots two cups of cubed potatoes two cups of sliced mushrooms and two large cloves of garlic finely diced now for our turkey just shred it with your fingers tear it up you'll need five to seven cups of this shredded leftover turkey and chicken is a great alternative as well I'm using an 8 quart pot and I've got it on a medium heat I'm going to add a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of butter once that's melted we'll start to add our veg let's start with two cups of our diced onions two carrots two celery diced one teaspoon of poultry seasoning and a half a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of pepper we'll mix that well and let that heat up for about four minutes now we'll add our two cloves of garlic stir that in and cook that for about another minute to help thicken our stool add three tablespoons of flour stir that in well for one to two minutes you want to almost cook that flour gets rid of the raw flavor of it add five cups of chicken stock two cups of cubed potatoes two cups of sliced mushrooms and turn the heat up we want to bring this to a boil next item leftover gravy if you have it add it and adds great flavor stir that in well bring it to a boil and then turn the heat down and let it simmer for 12 minutes it's been 12 minutes I'm gonna check the potato there it is the knife slides right into it it's nice and tender we can move along let's add that wonderful leftover turkey 5 to 7 cups and then let it simmer for 10 minutes now here we're comes to personal preference how thick do you like your stew it's still a bit thin for me so I'm gonna add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with a quarter cup of water and just add that to our stew mix it well bring it to a boil add a little bit more if you need to but that looks just perfect for me nice and rich oh boy now my last two items 1 8 ounce can of corn I added in last because I like my corn crunchy and 1 cup of frozen peas let that simmer 10 minutes and then guess what time it is it's serving time look at that oh boy so chunky all that turkey and vegetables just looks delicious maybe on the side I'll have some nice fresh chewy Italian bread with a little bit of butter on it oh boy let's get into it [Music] well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music] you [Music] [Music]
