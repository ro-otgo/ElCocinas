hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious is always my model and as promised I said it's getting close to the holiday season so I'm going to focus on cooking for large groups and appetizers today it's appetizers I love appetizers they're so versatile you can make them your own change them up and you can just have a couple of appetizers and a salad and make it into a meal we're going to be doing long Tong stuff appetizers these packages are long time you get over 50 wontons in each package they go a long way they're reasonably priced find them in the produce section and often beside where the tofu is so we'll be creating little cups out of these and then stuffing them with all sorts of things get creative make it your own let's get them in the cups starting out by greasing your pan with a little bit of cooking spray [Music] and then tuck them in your little muffin pans now this muffin pan is only two and three-quarter inches across you don't want to go any bigger it's about an inch and a quarter deep you don't want to go any bigger than that because you won't end up with a cup so you lay them in two finger method tuck them down inside like so this is a great recipe to get the kids or grandkids involved you can have them help stuff each little Wang Tong good time to teach them a little bit of safety in the kitchen let's get them into the oven 350 degrees or seven minutes the wonton cups are ready to get stuffed I'm starting out with a little pinch of cheese in the bottom of each cup I am going to incorporate some different flavors but I like a little pinch of cheese on the bottom it holds everything together nicely not mandatory that's the way I do it now I've got 12 cups here so I'm gonna do three different flavors for my cups I'm gonna start out with this roll here we're going to do just a basic pizza one a little diced up pepperoni [Music] you can add whatever pizza topping you like and then a little bit of pizza sauce and then we'll finish that one with a little pinch of cheese you can add more sauce on top if you like it saucy now for my next one little bruschetta nice fresh I put a little cucumber in mine and onion and tomato balsamic some garlic a little salt and pepper incorporate all those flavors you can buy fresh etta already all made you don't have the time and then we'll top that with a little bit of cheese as well so as you can see the choices are endless you could make dessert little cups and the last one is my favorite one I'm starting off with a little bit of slanter on the bottom and a shrimp this is about just a small shrimp cooked shrimp if you have raw ones just cook them for two minutes boil them for two minutes in water and then put them in an ice bath this is like a 31 to 40 shrimp per pound and then a little bit of Asian sauce there's all sorts of Asian sauces you can find out there we've got a little garlic ginger soya sauce and oyster sauce it works really well but again there's all sorts of beautiful Asian sauces you can buy in a jar out there and then we'll top that off with a little bit of cheese as well I left my oven on at 350 and then we'll take this over there pop it in the oven [Music] another seven minutes and they're done let me also make mention these little cups here if you want it to make a lot more of them and set them aside just get a spoon gently pull them out set them aside and make more then you can fill your cups on a big cookie tray and bake them the same way let's get them in the oven [Music] here they are fresh out of the oven just use a little teaspoon get into a crevice and just spin it around sometimes the cheese will stick but if you just give it a twisting motion and they'll spin and come out every time and then simply get a nice little serving tray you can put each flavor on a different tray if you like or make it a surprise for the guests oh my goodness they look delicious I think it's time to try one how simple was that you don't need to make multiple appetizers for a get-together just change up the flavors I hope you enjoyed this I hope you get to try it with your family and friends and if you liked it give me a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my videos I put out a new one every Monday and you'll be notified well now you know what time it is I get to try the goods I'm going in for the Asian shrimp one Oh Wow you're gonna love it most Asian flavors were that little bit of cilantro the crunch of the wonton cups well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music]
