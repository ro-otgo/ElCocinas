hey lovelies the weather outside is cooling down which means things in the kitchen are just heating up and today we're celebrating the arrival of soup season with this absolutely incredible chicken pot pie soup yes it is just as good as it sounds basically it is all the goodness of a chicken pot pie except without having to fuss with any pie crust so what's not to like about that for me guys in all honesty soup seasoning is my favorite season when it comes to food so I am so excited I've got my nice big Soup pot on the stove and honestly I will tell you guys once My Soup pot is on the stove it basically doesn't come off the stove until the spring because you know how much I love me some soup so in my nice big Soup pot I've got a little bit of oil heating up over medium high heat and then just as soon as my oil is nice and hot I'm going to start adding my classic mirepoix that's a fancy name for basically onion carrot and celery the base for any great soup in my opinion I like letting my veggies cook up for say between three and four minutes just until they start to soften then it's time to get some garlic into the pot glorious garlic the more garlic the better especially when it comes to soup now after about just 30 seconds or so that garlic becomes nice and fragrant and that means it is time to add our flour to the pot now the flour is going to help thicken this soup tremendously so it gets nice and creamy and delicious I like to let that flour cook for about a minute or so stirring it constantly because it really helps to get rid of that flowery flavor you know what I'm talking about right and once we've cooked that flowery flavor off time to add the rest of our ingredients starting with our chicken so of course it would not be chicken soup without chicken today I have got three chicken breasts that I shredded you could easily make this recipe with leftover chicken or with rotisserie chicken from the supermarket you can pull it apart and use that chicken you could also actually cook your chicken right in your Soup pot if you want to but I find this is the perfect place for leftover chicken so whenever I have it this soup is on the menu next I'm going to go ahead and add some potatoes to this I've got two potatoes that I've peeled and diced and then it's time for my chicken broth you really want to use a good quality chicken broth in this kind of cooking as far as I'm concerned it really does have a huge impact on the flavor if you've got homemade chicken broth of course that's optimal but if you don't go ahead and use the store-bought kind there's lots of awesome versions there and the final ingredient we'll be adding is my favorite addition to pretty much any pot of soup I've got some sprigs of thyme headed in here and I'm just going to put them in hole and let them work their delicious Herby Magic and we're going to bring this to a boil and as soon as it's reached to boil I'm going to reduce my heat to about medium pop a lid on top and let this cook away for about 12 to 15 minutes basically all I want to do is make sure that my potato is cooked through and has become nice and tender and those flavors have had a chance to develop a little bit I will mention this is a very quick cooking soup you could sort of simmer it low and slow if you want to but if you're in a pinch and want to serve it on a busy weeknight this soup can be cooked in under 30 minutes not too bad for a weeknight suit alright so after 15 minutes you can see it's so thick and Rich it smells amazing in here guys I have to tell you at this point I'm ready to just add my finishing ingredients so I'm going to go ahead and get in here with a nice big splash of cream the cream in this recipe is optional but it does help to make a really rich and delicious broth so I highly recommend it and then I am also going to add some corn to this so I've got frozen corn kernels here I'm gonna add those right in and I've also got some peas you could pretty much add any veggies you want to this soup that's what makes it so good it's super versatile and then finally I'm also going to add a nice big helping of freshly chopped parsley to help brighten everything up a little bit and honestly guys how gorgeous is this soup you just want to let it cook for another say two to three minutes just until your corn and your peas are heated through and then it is ready to be served it is the perfect thing for fall it's so rich and comforting you can serve it up with some nice crusty bread if you want to to soft up all that yumminess this is a total crowd pleaser your family will absolutely adore it at least mine does and I hope you will give it a try for yourselves if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because
