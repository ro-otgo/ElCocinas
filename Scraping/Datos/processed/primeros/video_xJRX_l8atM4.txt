[Music] this week on in the kitchen with pete we're making a delicious simple creamy tomato soup i had a hankering for some nice creamy tomato soup so i came up with this recipe i'm going to be using some chicken stock vegetable stock is great as well half and half cream san marzano tomatoes garlic onions some herbs and carrots now why the carrots often in tomato soups they add sugar amongst many other soups it sweetens it up for sure and gets rid of some of that acidity in the tomatoes but the carrots do just as well and i'm no nutritionist but i gotta think carrots are better for you than sugar just saying anyways let's get over the stove and get cooking peel two large carrots and then using a box grater look for the teardrop holes i'll use the smaller ones and we'll grate that up and set that aside in a pot on medium heat we're going to add one teaspoon of each butter and olive oil we'll add one cup of white onions finely diced just to soften them up about five minutes clear out a little spot in the bottom of the pan and add a drizzle of olive oil then we're going to add two large cloves of garlic finely diced stir that in and then let's add some more herbs we're going to add a half a teaspoon of italian seasoning and a half a teaspoon of ground rosemary stir it in for about a minute to let it release all those flavors and aromas now don't skimp on this use san marzano tomatoes whole tomatoes 28 ounces we'll add that to our pot and then we're going to mash that up i'll use my handy tool here that's well it's meant to be used for cooking ground beef but i find it perfect for this process as well now we'll stir in five fresh chopped basil leaves fresh is the best way folks dried basil just won't give you the same flavor we'll stir in our carrots and then we'll add our chicken broth one and a half cups or vegetable broth will work as well turn it up to high heat and bring it to a boil reduce the heat to low cover it and let it simmer for 40 minutes stir it occasionally add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and now it's time to blend it i'm using my immersion blender these work very well for this process you can use a stand up blender as well and bring that to a nice smooth consistency [Music] there we go it's looking nice and smooth now and now we're gonna add some half and half cream make sure it's at room temperature when you add this and then gently stir that in and you'll see how nice and silky it becomes [Music] give it a final check for salt and pepper mmm i think that's just perfect it's time to serve it up oh my doesn't that look delicious now here's the way i like it i like to add a couple little croutons just sprinkle those on top or maybe you'd like a dollop of sour cream i'm gonna top mine with a little fresh grated parmesan oh yeah you're gonna love it i'll garnish that with a little bit of fresh basil on top it's time to come to the table another simple and delicious recipe i got lots more of them hit that little red subscribe button and you'll get notified every time i put up a new video well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pete until next time see ya [Music] you
