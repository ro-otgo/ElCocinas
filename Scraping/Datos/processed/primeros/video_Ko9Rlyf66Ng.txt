hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete today simple and delicious recipe tomato and roasted garlic soup we got three things to get organized before we start building our soup we're going to saute some onions we're gonna roast some garlic and make our little basil bits simply all I did was bake up some fresh basil from the garden so let's get those three items gone and then we'll build our soup so first we need a half of a white onion we're just going to rough cut that we'll be blending up this soup after so no need to cut it to fine we'll get that on the stove we'll simmer it for about 5-6 minutes just to soften up those onions for our garlic you want to cut the tops off like so I like to use a serrated knife because the stems in these sometimes are quite tough so you just want to take about a half of an inch off like so any loose paper you can remove [Music] next let's get a piece of tinfoil [Music] and we're going to drizzle that with just a touch of olive oil cover it up [Music] and you can use these little pans just to keep them upright 45 minutes at 400 degrees and now to our basil bits [Music] [Music] [Music] well now it's the fun time we get to build our soup you can see my roasted garlic came out just beautifully after 45 minutes in the oven lots of uses for this roasted garlic sometimes some people find garlic you know kind of pungent a very strong taste when you roast it it sweetens it up it tames down the flavor it's great and lots of recipes roasted garlic mashed potatoes soups sauces you can also use this just if you're going to make some garlic toasts spread this on some toast you can mix it up with a little bit of butter maybe some sour cream but you can see when we squeeze it out they just pop out all those beautiful clothes we're gonna get those all into the pot then you use the whole head and then next we're gonna get to our tomatoes use a good quality canned Italian plum tomato so we've got here one 28-ounce can you can mash those up a little bit with a potato masher just so it spreads around and leap more evenly and I had one tomato left from my garden so waste not want not let's add that in there too nothing too scientific about this and then next we have our sauteed onions 1/2 onion that we sauteed 1 cup of fresh Parmesan cheese when you grade it yourself it's nice and fluffy and then I have six fresh basil leaves that I just chopped up and a half a teaspoon of each salt and pepper and then we want some chicken stock about a liter 32 ounces if you're gonna use the store-bought use a low-sodium this is my homemade chicken broth that I made you can find out how to make that on episode 43 on in the kitchen with Pete the recipes there so let's add that to our soup and let's get that over to the stove so we brought it to a boil we'll turn the heat down partially cover it and then let it simmer for 45 minutes it's been 40 minutes it's time to blend up our soup you have a couple of choices I'm gonna be using an immersion blender however you can also use your blender just remember when you're using one of these blenders to remove this top you'll make a big mess just put a towel over this blender up but I'm gonna use my immersion blender also known as a stick blender tip it up on an angle continue to blend [Applause] that's looking pretty good next we're going to add one cup of cream I've got half-and-half if you'd like a heavier cream that's fine or just simply milk will do it's time to serve it up and what could go better with our tomato soup some nice grilled cheese sticks for dipping [Music] well that was another simple and delicious recipe if you enjoy the recipe give me a thumbs up or you can subscribe to my videos and you'll get notified every Monday when I put out a new simple and delicious recipe well tomato soup maybe you like crackers in it maybe you like croutons I'm gonna put a little bit of my nice roasted basil bits in there and then what's better with a tomato soup is a grilled cheese I've whipped up a nice grilled cheese and I've cut it into strips for dipper's I get to try the goods now [Music] Wow [Music] oh man you're gonna love that soup that roasted garlic isn't too powerful just comes through nicely the fresh herbs lots of tomatoes you're gonna love it well thanks for watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya [Music] [Music]
