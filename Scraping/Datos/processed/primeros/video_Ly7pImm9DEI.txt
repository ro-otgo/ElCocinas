today I am super excited to share with you one of my all-time favorite comfort food recipes that is perfect for a cold January day it's my vegetable minestrone and the best part about it is that it can all be made in your slow cooker basically all you need to do is toss all your ingredients in give it a quick stir and then the slow cooker does all the work as you know every Monday through the month of January I'll be sharing delicious slow cooker recipes just like this one and the best part is they are all entirely vegetarian so they are perfect for meatless Monday to my slow cooker I'm going to add some finely diced onion celery and carrot to that I'm going to add some zucchini some white beans and some diced tomatoes to this I'm going to add some garlic and then top it all with some vegetable stock it already smells amazing I'm going to season it really simply with some Italian seasoning some salt and some pepper this soup is so hard it can stand up quite a lot of seasoning so I'm going to give this a really good stir put on the lid and then set my slow cooker to low for six to eight hours the longer it simmers the more delicious it becomes about 20 minutes before it's finished cooking I'm going to add some cooked quinoa now I'm using quinoa in this recipe because I want to keep it entirely gluten free but you could use pasta or some rice or some barley those would all work just as well now this soup is beautiful when served immediately or you can freeze it for up to six months it's a perfect make-ahead meal for a night where you just don't feel like cooking I hope you'll give this delicious soup a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I love seeing what you're coming up with in your very own kitchen speaking of Instagram if you haven't followed me there already be sure to follow me at the domestic geek one because every day through January I am sharing a brand-new smoothie recipe and they are all absolutely delicious and finally if you haven't already be sure to subscribe to the domestic geek because there's lots more deliciousness where this came from go soup
