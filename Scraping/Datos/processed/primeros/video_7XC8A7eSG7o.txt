[Music] hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with pete simple and delicious is always my motto and this week i'm showing you one of my new creations i call it crispy prosciutto shrimp rolls they're outstanding you're gonna love it let's get to it use a nice fresh mozzarella ball cut them into about half inch slices and then again into about two and a half to three inch strips [Music] we'll need some shrimp about a 31 to 40 count works perfectly for this recipe now if you don't already have them cooked here's a quick way to do it place raw shrimp in a pot of cold water place on high heat when it boils turn the heat off cover for two minutes and then strain it and then put it into a bowl of ice water and then when they're chilled they're ready to go [Music] now if you have someone that doesn't like shrimp or maybe shrimp allergies not to worry skip the shrimp add the cheese these things are still delicious you'll need one and a half cups of seasoned panko bread crumbs i like to season it a little more with a half a teaspoon of garlic powder and a half a teaspoon of onion powder then mix this thoroughly for our wet mixture we'll need two eggs well beaten [Music] to begin rolling lay two pieces of prosciutto on a flat surface slightly overlapping one another like i'm doing here then we add the cheese and then the shrimp and then simply roll it up tucking in the ends let's do another one lay out your prosciutto slightly overlapping cheese shrimp roll it up tuck in the sides and it's that simple and here's the one that we're doing without shrimp simply add the cheese roll it up in the same fashion tuck in the sides done these will be delicious as well coating them is simple wet mixture and the dry mixture use a fork to help roll it around and ensure that the panko crumbs are stuck securely to it on the edges as well set them aside on a plate or a sheet pan and let's get ready to cook in a pan on a medium to high heat add about a half an inch of peanut oil to test to see if it's ready just simply add a bread crumb and when it's sizzling it's time to do your cooking [Music] simply add them to the oil and it doesn't take very long it's only about two minutes per side until they get a nice golden brown after two minutes gently give them a flip two forks is really handy for doing this after they're done simply remove them and place them on a paper towel to drain [Music] you choose the sauce you like you could use ranch you could use plum sauce my favorite is sweet chili sauce give it a try if you have leftovers they're great the next day warmed up in the oven 400 degrees 10 to 12 minutes works perfectly let's take a look at these plated up oh there's my sweet chili sauce this was at our appetizer party they were a big hit along with many other wonderful dishes i cut one in half take a look at it inside you can see that beautiful mozzarella cheese melted that lovely shrimp the prosciutto and that delicious crispy coating on the outside oh my you're gonna love it so normally on camera at this time i would be trying some of those delicious crispy prosciutto shrimp rolls but here's what happened they were so delicious kelly and i started snacking on them and before we know it they were all gone all the other ones are spoken for because we're having an appetizer party so all i can tell you is they're outstanding well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with pete until next time baby please don't pretend
