hi folks you're in the kitchen with Pete thanks for coming out today we're gonna do balsamic glazed pizza we're all used to having like a tomato-based pizza but where do you try the balsamic glaze delicious you can find this in the grocery store around where the vinegar and the salad dressing are just look for the balsamic glaze next we want a good quality pizza show if you're not making your own I find these at my local store they're delicious then crust to lapak they work perfect then we want some grated cheese I like to use a mixture of grated cheese mozzarella parmesan and provolone you can get these in packages at the store if you like already pre-mixed shred it up they work perfect prosciutto just going to tear them up put it on the pizza some finely sliced onions very thinly sliced some dried tomatoes you can get them julienne style right in the jar they're all diced up ready to go on your pizza some fresh basil I love growing basil in the summer if you don't have any fresh in the backyard you can get in a little package at the grocery store next I have a couple of options for pans a round pan it's metal it's solid it's not my first go-to just because it tends to make the crust a little more soft if that's what you like use it we also have the metal style with the holes in it that'll get the bottom of the crust a little more crispy that works well and I like to use a pizza stone this works well gets the crust crispy and they work great on the barbecue as well now that's everything that we need to build our pizza so let's get at it I like to put my shell on a thin cutting board so that way it's easy for me to carry over to the stove because I'm gonna slide it right in the stove on my pizza stone that's now preheating so we'll start off first with our balsamic glaze you can be generous with this try and get it right to the edges then go around several times and then I'll be spreading it from there with my spoon like so just give it a quick spread like I said try and get it to the lot of the edges there you want this tasty right to the very edge like so next is our cheese this is about a cup and a half if that's too much for you don't put it all on or if you want more put more on that's what's fun about pizza that's what's fun about cooking make it yours okay next will be the prosciutto I've just kind of torn these up into pieces I'm gonna lay them around I'm generous with the prosciutto it's very tasty on this pizza looking good and excellent okay sun-dried tomatoes nice and sweet tasty don't forget to buy them like that julienne style are already diced up yes see how thinly I've diced these up that's what you want so it's not too overpowering and then the basil I'm gonna take the basil oh nothing high-tech about this tear it up a little to the size as you like gives it a great color on the peaches on it so it's all ready to go on the stove before I throw it in this is optional I like to put a little drizzle of our balsamic on the top just a nice little drizzle looks nice let's get it into the oven 450 about seven eight minutes keep an eye on it it's gonna be good I'll take it out and we'll plate it up doesn't it look delicious rather than your typical pizza slices I kind of squared up the pieces it looks great on the board whether you're having it for a dinner or cut up this way it would be excellent for an appetizer party hey folks thanks for coming up watching your in the kitchen with Pete I hope you enjoyed the balsamic-glazed pizza let me know what you think there's a spot there for comments and thumbs up or you can subscribe to my videos and you'll get an automatic notification whenever I bring up a new video which I plan to do once per week so I think it's time to try a piece I've been waiting a while so good we'll see you again bye hey folks this is how you burn a pizza leave it in too long don't set your timer this what happened oops can't win them all
