hi folks and welcome to in the kitchen with Pete simple and delicious is my model and today we're doing just that we're gonna stuff some potatoes you've probably had some of these at your favorite restaurants double baked double cooked stuff they're delicious we're gonna whip them up I've got three good-sized baking potatoes I find that a half of one of these per person is plenty I'm serving up some ribs with this dinner so this is just a side stop in a few times with a fork I have a cookie sheet here covered with tin foil put our potatoes on a little dab of oil olive oil on each one cover all the surface and then we're gonna season these with just a little bit of salt on the outside this will give the outside some nice flavor when we're cutting through our potato after and that's all we need to do to get the started into the oven 350 one hour so my potatoes have cooled down cut them down the center here lengthways [Music] now you can use a potato masher I'm using a potato ricer it works really well make sure the table is nice and smooth and creamy this is a potato ricer that was a nice gift from my daughter shake so just using a soup spoon I'm gonna go around the outside leave a little bit of the potato and that will help keep the potato somewhat rigid so you can fill it back up with the creamy potatoes we're going to make [Music] [Music] there we go we have a nice cavity to put all our nice goodies inside well just carry on with these [Music] so to our potatoes we're going to add a quarter cup of softened butter 1/4 cup of sour cream 1/4 cup of cream cheese I have the garlic and herb in this one and then we're going to add about 1/2 a cup of grated cheddar cheese and we'll save about 1/2 a cup to lay them on top after 3 tablespoons of bacon bits and some salt and pepper but a half a teaspoon of each [Music] and one finely diced spring onion mix all that up real well want to get a nice creamy mixture now check the texture and make sure that it's right for you if it's not creamy enough add a little bit more sour cream every potatoes different sizes so you might have to tweak on what you want sour cream and cream cheese so we're gonna put generous amount and these want it poking out over Neath the top [Music] they're all ready to go in 400 degrees for about 15 minutes and they'll be ready they're gonna be delicious here they are fresh out of the oven time to serve them up well that was another simple and delicious recipe these stuffed potatoes can be made the day before they rewarmed perfectly 400 degrees for 20 minutes and they freeze well well don't forget to subscribe to my channel hit the red subscribe button it's a free feature that it's on YouTube when you subscribe to my channel you get notified every Monday when I put out a new video it's that simple or you can give me a thumbs up or leave me a comment well it's my favorite time I'm gonna try the goods oh boy oh boy oh wow it's so creamy inside and cheesy on top the bacon comes true it would make a great side to any meal well thanks for coming out and watching in the kitchen with Pete until next time see ya
